<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>What is productivity</h2>
<p>There are as many definitions for productivity, as there are productivity bloggers. I didn’t want to break a tradition, so in my understanding:</p>
<p>Productivity is simply the rate at which a task is being done.</p>
<p>If a task was done in 10 hours, then your productivity is 1 task per 10 hours. If the same task has taken you 1 hour, your productivity is now 1 task per 1 hour.</p>
<p>In both cases, we still use the word productivity as it simply states the rate of work being done. </p>
<p>There are 2 more words that go hand in hand with productivity. In the second case, when you only spent 1 hour instead of the usual 10, you got more <strong>productive</strong>. Also, <strong>efficiency</strong> per time invested has improved.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong> is a tricky term. To understand the word efficiency correctly, you need to specify the task and what inputs are being taken to complete this task. <strong>Efficiency</strong> always has something related to it. In our example above, it was the time that you have gotten more efficient with.</p>
<p>If we are talking about a company, then your <strong>productivity</strong> would be the rate at which a product is being manufactured. While improving the output would make your company more <strong>productive</strong> and improve <strong>efficiency</strong> based on the time spent per product.</p>
<p><strong>Labor productivity</strong> is a hot term right now for CEOs of big companies. Labour productivity is just the amount of goods or service a total of your workforce(or labour force) produce in a given period of time. This is exactly the same thing. It is the <strong>productive</strong> rate of work.</p>
<h2>What does it mean for you?</h2>
<p>As humans, we always tend to choose the paths of least resistance. Sometimes it is crossing the road without the pedestrian crossing. Sometimes it is using the already known but outdated method of solving a problem.</p>
<p>Productivity, as a buzz word, that has been thrown around the internet a bunch. But the bottom line is that it can be improved and should be improved in everyday tasks.</p>
<p>What is better, solving a problem in 5 hours right now, or spending 1 hour on research and completing all of the future problems that are similar in 1 hour? Most of the people would irrationally choose the option of doing a task now, for 5 hours. </p>
<p>Process of <strong>learning</strong> has always been <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040233">the most painful process for most of us.</a> That is why our body and brain try to stay away from learning as much as possible.</p>
<p>The bad news here is that if you want to improve your productivity, you have to start learning every day and in every aspect of your life. Improving productivity can work wonders, but you have to put some amount of work to learn what to improve and how to improve.</p>
<p>The main problem is that increase in productivity has a marginal diminishing returns to time spent on it. Which means that with each increment of time you put in, less you will improve your productivity. It is effortless to increase your productivity 2x, but after that increasing, it 2x again can take twice as long.</p>
<p><img alt="image of start vs perfect visualisation" src="https://i.gyazo.com/a2a2c66c60c6b53a14b22a40908f3230.png"></p>
<p>That means that those that put out steps to improve your productivity and your work x10 straight away, make the process of learning as easy as possible. This reduces the time needed to learn, which in turn makes sure that you will stick with the hole task of improving.</p>
<p>Why are courses such a huge part of our lives? There are productivity courses on hard skills(productivity, design and marketing) everywhere right now. But now even soft skills(public speaking, presenting, communicating and thinking) courses are just as relevant.</p>
<p>With the time of google and <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/how-to-succeed-in-life-online-in-2020">information overdose</a>, it is tough to have a clear picture of topics. Those that make a clear picture for you and organise the best content in a very easy to consume way are rewarded with dollars.</p>
<p>That is why some of the professional productivity courses can be very expensive.</p>
<h2>Professional and work-life</h2>
<p>Some of the courses in professional space can cost huge sums. Some of them are as expensive as 100$ thousand. You probably don’t want to spend that much money on a course or an MBA program yourself. That is when your communication skills with your boss come into play.</p>
<p>Improving your productivity is not something that only will improve your personal life. Productivity will improve your professional life, as well. </p>
<p>Imagine a scenario:</p>
<p>Your boss can hire 2 new employees, that are at the middle level of skills, and spend $100 thousand per year on salary.</p>
<p><img alt="2 middle employees with $50k salary each" src="https://i.gyazo.com/2a818faa8eb3453790f1b1a795651ffd.png"></p>
<p>Or he can hire you and pay you $60 thousand in salary but also buy courses for $20 thousand that you will have to understand fully. </p>
<p>Let’s think that these courses will improve your productivity at work-related tasks x4. Now the employer has spent 80$ thousand, and you can do as much work as 4 other employees. Basically, you are saving an employer $120 thousand.</p>
<p><img alt="1 senior supper employee with 60 + 20 thousand dollars" src="https://i.gyazo.com/ddedad6f922bc9661accb5a238bf2639.png"></p>
<p>This is a very common thing that employers consider when hiring. If you show passion for learning and willing to improve and take critique on the interview, that shows that you are the type of person that can be invested in.</p>
<p>There is research that shows that some of the bootcamps for professionals can improve productivity at specific task x25. That is why x4 is not an exaggeration. Knowledge is power. It was, and it always will be.</p>
<p>This is just a simple case that can be done on a big scale, but think of countless udemy courses that for $10 can make an oblivious junior engineer into a decent high-end junior? Knowing from personal experience, that $10 can save you 100 hours for your senior engineer and the junior will have a good base to understand how to carry forward.</p>
<h2>Improving Productivity is easy</h2>
<p>If I asked — how much free time do you have? Most people would say no free time. I get it we all are busy bees.</p>
<p>But I bet you have 5 minutes per day of free time. I even bet that you have more, but 5 minutes will do for now.</p>
<p>What you need to do is to choose 5 minutes that will be free for you every single day, 365 days a year. Do you have a time slot chosen? Okay.</p>
<p>So now, I want you to spend this 5 minutes every day working on your productivity. Buy a course for your work for $10 on udemy, download YouTube tutorials relevant to you. I want you to spend those 5 minutes learning on how to improve.</p>
<p>If after 5 minutes you want to carry on for a bit, sweet. If no, then just stop after 5 minutes and carry on with your day. Make sure, though, to do this <strong>every, single, day.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Let’s do some maths:</p>
<p>5 X 365 = 1825 minutes or 30.5 hours that you spent learning. I would gladly take out 5 minutes from my day for 30.5 hours of improvement in a year.</p>
<p>It is all in compounding. Just getting better for a little bit will make all your life easier. Getting better for a little bit but in the long period of time, constantly, will change your life entirely. </p>
<p>If you improve your productivity by 1% each day, then at the end of the year( 1.01^365 ) you will be 37.8 times better then when you started.</p>
<p>This whole learning and productivity processes are what actually differentiates the average from the great.</p>
<p>For freelancers, it is what separates the $5 an hour and $500 an hour professionals.</p>
<p>A person can finish 10 projects and earn a $1000 or can do 1 project and get $10000. That is also an example of efficiency that has gotten improved.</p>
<p>If you don’t improve your productivity, <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/the-world-doesnt-stop-when-you-are-tired">someone else there will</a> and will most likely drive you out of your comfortable life.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p><strong>Productivity</strong> is a buzz word everyone throws around. Next time when you are doing anything, think of a word <strong>improvement.</strong> As long as you <strong>improve</strong>, it doesn’t matter what you are doing and how.</p>
<p>You as always have to start small to get somewhere big. It is all in the process. Get so comfortable with the process, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/in-love-with-boredom">that without it, you will be bored.</a></p>
<p>You want to become a person that is a constant learner, and that is efficient in everything. Only then you can guarantee success.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			

<h2 id="the-collaboration-problem-overwriting-each-other-changes">The collaboration problem: overwriting each other changes</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/858fc86df4e90dc814f90527bbcf13bbf2bffc87/f1ba3/images/eventual-consistency/rest-overwriting.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>In traditional online applications, when you make a modification to the state of the object you work on, the change propagates to a central server that holds the “truth”. The server registers the change and sends back a confirmation that the change was indeed applied.</p>

<p>The problem happens when Alice and Bob <strong>try to update the same database field at the same time</strong>. At this point, there will be a <strong>data race</strong> and whichever request gets to the database <strong>last, will “win”, the other will be discarded</strong>.  That’s quite a jarring experience especially because round-trip latency of up to a second aren’t unusual (especially on mobile), so Alice might have moved on thinking their change applied, only to realize later on that it was overwritten. This is quite regrettable especially since those two updates aren’t technically conflicting, they are modifying different parts of the same string.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This traditional approach wasn’t designed with real time collaboration in mind and it naturally induces latency and flow challenges, making the collaboration experience worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to work around the latency and some of the conflict resolutions challenges is to <strong>pretend that we don’t need to talk to a server and that all changes are local</strong>. This is the approach the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid framework</a> chose.  Fluid still needs to <strong>eventually have all collaborators agree on the current state of our object(s) and has to avoid all conflicts</strong>. For that, it relies on <strong>eventual consistency provided by distributed data structures</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid</a> abstracts the networking and backend layers so developers can focus on building an user experience by only thinking “local”. There isn’t a centralized canonical data truth to check against anymore, instead all connected users have the data locally and all these users always eventually end up with the exact same data. This “local” approach allows for a zero latency experience while keeping data consistent.</p>

<h2 id="eventual-consistency-using-special-data-structures">Eventual consistency using special data structures</h2>

<h3 id="example-alice-and-bob-are-co-editing-a-document-at-the-same-time">Example: Alice and Bob are co-editing a document at the same time</h3>

<p><strong>Alice and Bob both load a Fluidified application</strong>. The User Interface uses <strong>Fluid to load and manage the state</strong> of its underlying data. The application <strong>page has a title</strong> for which the initial state is loaded by <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid</a> from a server, the title reads “hello world!”</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5fe96cbfaf69cfa676bb9b7eaad3a3567a7cd8ca/da45e/images/eventual-consistency/fluidified-string.svg" alt="Fluid setup"></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Alice edits the title</strong> so it reads “hello Alice!”, the change is applied right away to the data structure representing the title and an operation representing the change is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a> to propagate to all connected collaborators.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b767c84c311440c217f1ee607144f249ee118399/02453/images/eventual-consistency/alice-change.svg" alt="Alice edits the title"></p>

<p>A new operation is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a>:
<code>Replace characters at position 6, new content: "Alice"</code></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>At the very same time, Bob edits the title too</strong>. He injects an upside down exclamation mark so the title reads “¡hello world!”. The change is reflected right away on Bob’s screen and an operation is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a> to propagate to the connected collaborators.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7079e0ad9d69c2b95d95fea5f55f7867e47c47f2/dd2d7/images/eventual-consistency/bob-change.svg" alt="Bob edits the same title"></p>

<p>A new operation is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a>:
<code>Insert character at position 0, new content: "¡"</code></p>

<hr>

<p>Even though Alice and Bob edited the same text at the same time, both saw their change being <strong>applied right away</strong> and then saw their <strong>collaborator changes being applied without any conflicts</strong>. They <strong>eventually</strong> both see the same <strong>consistent title</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7ba2a7567e7a8078008068aed0a40a51b330d660/dabe2/images/eventual-consistency/final-string.svg" alt="Final string"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>By breaking down content into <strong>smart linked structures that know how to deal with granular changes</strong>, and can handle potential conflicts on each user’s device, users never wait for anything to happen and therefore feel like there isn’t any latency . Those <strong>smart structures are referred as Distributed Data Structures</strong> (DDSes) in <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid</a> parlance and are the key to making Fluid feel real time. <strong>Fluid offers various DDSes</strong> to cover the diverse needs of developers besides working on a collaborative text. Most DDSes link one to one to known structures such as strings, maps or linked lists. <strong>Developers can focus solely on the creation of amazing User Experiences and data modeling</strong>, <em>the underlying concerns such as connectivity, data transfer and applying of operations and conflict resolutions are handled by the framework</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-184f6be698e4-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc36150f7e15501838a699f_3C877AnDdlSJbqfxjZakSrkuQ6NuM0CNdqLoQvUNkeH3u3ScA-BmwT0Qbkb0NsFSDoElP6iR-iS4zhQ-QNa_cEMzBQ0XbHk6xsMTaU1EypUH-XFO7m_sywyykBR2iA_6wc4QMQHL.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>A very common challenge faced by many software products is the need for the application server to communicate with other third party application servers. To be more specific, my application server needs to be notified when a particular event takes place in a 3rd party application server.<br></p><p>For instance, I am currently building a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">customer support software</a> in which customer queries can come from various channels of communication including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. This means that if someone sends a message on Facebook messenger, that message has to ultimately reach my application server in some way so I can perform the necessary operations.<br></p><p>The most common way to solve this problem is with the use of webhooks.<br></p><h3><strong>What is a webhook?</strong><br></h3><p>A webhook is nothing but an API end point that is created in your own application server which is made public and it is called by other applications to provide your application with real time updates for various events.<br></p><p>The product that I am currently building integrates with Shopify and every time somebody places an order on a merchants Shopify store, my application needs to be notified in real time so that the order can be indexed in my database and my application then has the capability to query all orders placed by a particular user.<br></p><p>To solve this, I would have to create an API end point on my server in the form of <em>/webhooks/shopify/orders/create</em> and register this URL with Shopify. Whenever Shopify receives a new order in their system, their server will fire this URL along with the order data.<br></p><h3><strong>How to inspect a webhook?</strong><br></h3><p>Since a webhook is called from a 3rd party server that is out of your control, you have no way of knowing what kind of data will be sent in the webhook unless you actually create an API, host it somewhere that is public and register the endpoint with the 3rd party software. <br></p><p>If this seems like a lot of work just to view the contents of a webhook, products like <a href="https://requestbin.com/" target="_blank">requestbin</a> and <a href="https://beeceptor.com/" target="_blank">beecepter</a> were built exactly for this purpose. You can get a free endpoint from these products and register it in the 3rd party software after which you can trigger the event you are looking for and view the contents of the request on their dashboard.<br></p><p>However I believe in simplicity and these services come with their own set of constraints. So after a little bit of research I found that the netcat utility that is installed by default In most UNIX based machines solves this problem quite elegantly.<br></p><h5>Using netcat to inspect a webhook<br></h5><p>In the most simplest form, you can set up a webhook listener with a simple terminal command<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b0a8efaad418feeae02e4285582e2ce5.js&lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>This command will listen for any requests coming on the port 3000 and display it on the terminal itself. Let us try it out by entering <a href="http://localhost:8000/my/webhook/path" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/my/webhook/path</a> on the browser and see what happens.<br></p><figure id="w-node-060a8fc15179-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc34225f58539412e8fad89_gN3PHr5rIsoV-eU02OEnVfFRqw10WcvJV73B2eTxDnL1IanCGiOyMGuomBwxTo7LJV2QmqfyFgSYRT5cNlIIK-YsdFC3Pt8k4U_vmrVt65rlvqVDok1o44yR-_rKqVr0YGLXKV8U.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Inspecting the contents of a http request<br></figcaption></figure><p>The output on the terminal contains the entire http request that was received by localhost:3000 including the http method, headers and content. But there are two clear problems here:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>The browser keeps waiting for a response from the netcat server which is never received, so it eventually times out.</li><li>The netcat server displays the webhook request and then shuts down after which it will no longer accept any more requests unless you re-run the command.<br></li></ul><p>Both of these problems have simple solutions. Let’s go through them in order.<br></p><h5><strong>Returning a response</strong> <br></h5><p>One can easily create a simple HTTP message and return that as the response to the requests made to this netcat server. Here is how you do it:<br></p><p>Create a file called response.txt with these contents.<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/0753a1ac3a4442eedb3c0f811740e4ec.js &lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>Echo the contents of this file and pipe the netcat command to it.<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/5fffa3d857bab441dd85fad1061da384.js &lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>Now upon hitting localhost:3000 on your browser, you will receive a response in the browser.</p><figure id="w-node-7c8443ed0138-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc342e7f19477bb7649ae48_Wxi5VFUp0fleE1u1NrVneah1s_TxVNEXXKaXw092dB-lfc3M7ljNOgoTIp0uvn8WiEZT071uf0P4vNbTQcrknLXckCJGsShTHzmMEoxUJ39O9rvCIfqbbUDtXnBSH67vAy2-X6wv.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>netcat server with response</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h5>Running the netcat server in a loop<br></h5><p>To prevent the netcat server from shutting down after a request is received, all we have to do is run the commands in a loop.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <time datetime="2020-11-29">November 29, 2020</time>
<p>In this post I’ll describe how to use <a href="">Pandoc</a> to convert Markdown to a full HTML page (including header/footer).</p>
<p>The Pandoc version used for the examples below is 2.11.2.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pandoc">What is Pandoc?</h2>
<p>Pandoc is an open-source document converter that is written in Haskell. It was initially released in 2006 and has been under active development since then.</p>
<p>The goal of Pandoc is to convert a document from one markup format to another. It distinguishes between input formats and output formats. As of writing this it supports <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#input-formats">38 input formats</a> and <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#output-formats">59 output formats</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll use Markdown as an input format and HTML as an output format.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-the-html-template">Preparing the HTML template</h2>
<p>To generate a full HTML page we have to use Pandoc’s standalone mode which will use a <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates">template</a> to add header and footer.</p>
<p>Pandoc ships with a default template, if you wish to use that skip this section and omit the <code>--template</code> argument.</p>
<p>The template we’ll use is this (save it to <code>template.html</code>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="date" content='$date-meta$'&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;$title$&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date: $date$&lt;/p&gt;
$body$
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc’s template variables can have <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#interpolated-variables">different formats</a>, the one we’re using here start and end with a dollar sign:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$date$</code>: A date in a parsable format. See the <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-set-automatically">date-meta docs</a> for a list of recognized formats for the <code>date</code> variable. We use this to show when the document was created</li>
<li><code>$date-meta$</code>: The <code>date</code> parsed to ISO 8601 format. This is automatically done</li>
<li><code>$title$</code>: The document title</li>
<li><code>$body$</code>: The document body in HTML (the converted Markdown)</li>
</ul>
<p>We only need to set the <code>date</code> and <code>title</code> in the Markdown document via a metadata block.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-markdown-file">Writing the Markdown file</h2>
<p>Create a Markdown file <code>doc.md</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: My Document
date: September 22, 2020
---

## Test
some text</code></pre>
<p>The beginning of the document is the metadata block with required <code>date</code> and <code>title</code> variables mentioned above.</p>
<p>Several Markdown variants are <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#Markdown-variants">supported</a> such as GitHub-Flavored markdown. This example uses <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc’s extended markdown</a> which is the default input for files with the <code>md</code> extension.</p>
<h2 id="converting-the-document">Converting the document</h2>
<p>Run the following command to generate the HTML page:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc --standalone --template template.html doc.md</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc will try to guess the input format from the file extension (<code>.md</code> will use the Markdown input format) and output it to HTML (the default output format).</p>
<p>The output will be printed to the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="date" content='2020-09-22'&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Document&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date: September 22, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="test"&gt;Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some text&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To save the document to a file we can either redirect stdout or use the <code>-o</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc --standalone --template template.html doc.md -o doc.html</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this example we’ve converted Markdown to a standalone HTML page that is using a custom template.</p>
<p>This was just a simple example of what Pandoc is capable to do. The standalone mode coupled with the bundled default templates makes it easy to generate a wide variety of outputs such as HTML presentations, Jupyter notebooks or PDF documents.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>
			<p>In this post, I summarize all that I have learned about the actual test scores&nbsp;of different income levels. &nbsp;In particular, I compare actual psychometric data of seven U.S. economic classes: (1) the homeless, (2) welfare recipients, (3) median Americans, (4) self-made millionaires&nbsp;(5) self-made decamillionaires, (6) self-made billionaires, and (7) self-made decabillionaires, and largely confirm my repeated assertion that average IQ increases by 8-10 points for every ten-fold increase in income, though there may be a few major exceptions to this overall trend. &nbsp;Also, by analyzing the slope of the standardized regression line predicting IQ from income, I find evidence that the true correlation between IQ and income (at least in America) is much higher than the 0.23 &nbsp;reported in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf">2006 meta-analysis</a>&nbsp;and even higher than the 0.4 correlation asserted by Arthur Jensen, and may even approach 0.5.</p>
<p>I also find tentative but shocking evidence that the IQ gap between the richest and poorest Americans may exceed an astonishing 70 points!</p>
<p>In this analysis I am limiting myself entirely to test score data so IQ estimates based on <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/07/26/if-billionaires-the-homeless-took-the-worlds-most-racist-iq-test/">ethnic composition</a> or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/56143/wai-americas-elite-2013.pdf">educational achievements</a> of various economic classes are only occasionally mentioned to buttress the actual psychometric results. &nbsp;In several cases, the data is somewhat anecdotal, and speculative statistical inferences are sometimes made.</p>
<p><strong>Technical note</strong></p>
<p>For each economic class, I provide two normalized <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/09/30/what-is-a-z-score-a-definition-2/">Z scores</a>; one measuring the median financial success, and one measuring the mean or median cognitive ability. &nbsp;The normalized Z scores are just measures of where each economic class ranks (in financial success or IQ) compared to a reference group (in this case U.S. adults in general, or U.S. adults of a specific age). &nbsp;For example a Z of +2.33 means you’re in the top 1%, and a Z of -2.33 means you’re in the bottom 1%. &nbsp;A Z of 0 means you’re right in the middle, etc.</p>


<p><strong>Median financial success: 0.09 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -3.13)</strong></p>
<p><span>In 2015, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homelessness-idUSKCN0T908720151120">roughly 423,750</a> American adults were homeless on a given night: One in 572 American adults (0.17%). &nbsp;Thus it can be estimated that the median homeless person is financially in the bottom 0.09%</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Median cognitive ability: 12.8 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -1.17)</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1104&amp;context=edu_fac">2004 study</a> found that 90 homeless men living in a large shelter in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, had a mean <a href="http://www.pearsonclinical.com/education/products/100000593/wechsler-abbreviated-scale-of-intelligence-wasi.html">WASI</a> full-scale IQ of 83.92 (<a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/09/23/what-is-a-standard-deviation-a-definition/">standard deviation</a> = 15.24). &nbsp;The WASI was published in 1999, and this study was published in 2004, so we should subtract 1.5 points for old norms which are thought to expire at a rate of 0.3 points a year (the Flynn effect), so the homeless likely have a mean IQ of 82.5 (U.S. norms) or about 80 (U.S. <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/04/20/the-use-of-white-norms-when-calculating-iq-greenwich-scale/">white norms</a>).</p>
<p>One problem with this study is that 81% of the sample was black (much higher than the 45% among homeless Americans in general) and these tend to score lower on IQ tests, at least in the general population, however a UK sample of homeless obtained virtually identical scores on the WASI, despite being 96% white.</p>
<p>In the &nbsp;UK<a href="http://www.academia.edu/1512384/Neuropsychological_and_cognitive_performance_of_homeless_adults">&nbsp;study</a>,&nbsp;the WASI full-scale IQ distribution of the homeless has a mean of 84.3. In this study, published in 2011, the WASI norms were by now even more outdated, so we should probably subtract 3.6 points for old norms, so this homeless sample have a mean IQ of 80.7 (U.S. norms) or about 78 (U.S. white norms).</p>
<p>Given the IQ of 80.7 (U.S. norms) among the the virtually all-white U.K. homeless sample, the IQ of 82.5 among the mostly blacks American sample is unlikely to be deflated by race, thus 83 is considered the best estimate of the American homeless.</p>


<p><strong>Median financial success: 8.5 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -1.4)</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/whos-on-welfare-9-shocking-stats-about-public-assistance.html/?a=viewall">About 17%</a> of U.S. adults between age 18 and 64 receive public assistance. &nbsp;Thus the <em>median</em> welfare recipient can be thought of as in the bottom 8.5% financially.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 30 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -0.53)</strong></p>
<p>It’s common knowledge in psychometric circles that reading comprehension tests are statistically equivalent to&nbsp;IQ tests, and a <a href="http://literacy.kent.edu/Oasis/Pubs/0700-8.pdf">literacy study</a> found that about 2/3 to 3/4 of adult welfare recipients (about 71%) have what’s classified as Level 1 or Level 2 literacy. &nbsp;By contrast, 1/2 of the general adult population are at these levels.</p>
<p>Since by definition, 1/2 of Americans have IQs below 100, it can be deduced that 71% of welfare recipients have IQs below 100. &nbsp;In a normal distribution, the 71 percentile is 8 IQ points (0.53 sigma) above the mean, so if IQ 100 is the 71 percentile among welfare recipients, the average welfare recipient should have an IQ 8 points less.</p>
<p>In other words, American welfare recipients average IQ 92 (U.S. norms) or about 90 (U.S. white norms).</p>
<p>Some might object that my analysis falsely assumes welfare recipients have the same IQ variance as the general U.S. population, but the above cited studies of the homeless suggest that poor Americans do indeed have a similar variance to Americans on the whole.</p>

<p><strong>Median financial success: 99th percentile&nbsp;of Americans&nbsp;in their 50s (normalized Z = +2.33)</strong></p>
<p>According to the 2000 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0740718584?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecalicocat-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0740718584">The Millionaire Mind</a> by Thomas J. Stanley, which reported on a survey of 773 &nbsp;millionaires (defined here by household, not individual net-worth), the typical self-made millionaire is a 54 year-old man. &nbsp;In the year 1998&nbsp;(when the millionaires were surveyed), it took an individual income of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/the-top-1-percentand-01-percentof-every-age-group-in-america/382094/">about $340,000</a>&nbsp;to make the top 1% for 52-58-year-olds. &nbsp;The surveyed millionaires had a median income of $436,000, but because this was household income, their spouses likely contributed, so in individual income they were likely not much higher than the top 1%</p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 88th percentile&nbsp;of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +1.2)</strong></p>
<p>The average self-reported SAT score of the millionaires Stanley survey was 1190, which Stanley adjusted to about 1100 because of self-reporting bias (millionaires who were “A students” were more likely to recall their scores than “C students”). &nbsp;Since 90% of the sample were college graduates it’s likely virtually all took the SAT.</p>
<p>Since the typical self-made millionaire in the sample was 54 as of 1998, it’s likely he took the SAT circa 1961 (when he was 17). &nbsp;According to the book <em>The Bell Curve</em> (page 422), if all American young adults (not just the college bound elite) had taken the SAT in 1960, the average score (IQ 100; U.S. norms) would have been 784. &nbsp;Meanwhile prior to 1974, an SAT score of 1300 <a href="http://www.us.mensa.org/join/testscores/qualifyingscores/">was considered</a> Mensa level (IQ 130). &nbsp;Extrapolating from these two data points, the average self-made millionaire has an IQ of 118 (U.S. norms); 117 (U.S. white norms).</p>

<p><strong>Median financial status: 99.9th percentile&nbsp;of Americans&nbsp;in their 50s (normalized Z = +3.1)</strong></p>
<p>20% of Stanley’s millionaire sample earned at least $1 million a year in household income, and many of these probably earned much more than that, and presumably the bulk of this was individual income made by&nbsp;by the head of households Stanley surveyed, not their spouses. &nbsp;Anyone in their 50s who has been earning a million a year for a long period of time, likely has, or will have, a net worth over $10 million (decamillionaire status). &nbsp;In the year 1998&nbsp;(when the millionaires were surveyed), it took an individual income of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/the-top-1-percentand-01-percentof-every-age-group-in-america/382094/">about $1.25 million</a>&nbsp;to make the top 0.1% for 52-58-year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 88th percentile&nbsp;of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +1.2)</strong></p>
<p>Above I noted that millionaires had a mean SAT score equating to IQ 118 (U.S. norms); 117 (U.S. white norms). &nbsp;Because Stanley found virtually no correlation between income or net-worth among the millionaires themselves it might be assumed that the decamillionaires in his sample also averaged IQ 118. &nbsp;Of course if the data was not normalized, the zero correlation might be misleading.</p>


<p><strong>Median financial success: 99.99993 percentile for&nbsp;baby boomers&nbsp;(normalized Z = +4.8)</strong></p>
<p>About <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-20/silent-generation-born-amid-depression-found-prosperity">80 million Americans</a> were born between 1946 and 1964 (the baby boomers). &nbsp;People in this age groups <a href="http://blog.aarp.org/2013/09/17/the-forbes-400-americas-richest-by-generation/">are about 42%</a>&nbsp;of the richest Americans. &nbsp; There are 277 self-made billionaires in America (see appendix A of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/56143/wai-the-global-elite-in-press.pdf">this document</a>). &nbsp;If we assume 42% of these are boomers, then 116 of America’s 80 million boomers are self-made billionaires, which means the median self-made billionaire boomer is the 58th most prosperous out of 80 million, equating to the 99.99993 percentile.</p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 98.6 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +2.2)</strong></p>
<p>Several boomer billionaires have SAT scores that are apparently publicly known. &nbsp;Bill Gates <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2014/10/13/high-iq-bill-gates-towers-as-the-richest-american-21-years-in-a-row/">claims&nbsp;to</a> have scored 1590 and Paul Allen <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=7J_EBQuPxAgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=paul+allen+sat+score+1600&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=84c18D89pV&amp;sig=Zp0R2cz10H90fOi-YWNNLYtbhvs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirn7aeiurKAhWmnYMKHZWQA4k4ChDoAQhTMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20allen%20sat%20score%201600&amp;f=false">reportedly&nbsp;scored</a> 1600. &nbsp;On the pre-1995 SAT, these <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/12/16/revised-chart-converting-sat-scores-to-iq-equivalents/">scores equate</a> to IQs of about 170. &nbsp;I can no longer find any internet sources reporting Steve Ballmer’s composite SAT scores,&nbsp;&nbsp;but he reportedly scored a <a href="http://time.com/2796391/steve-ballmer-los-angeles-clippers-new-owner/">perfect 800</a> on the math section of the SAT which seems to equate to an IQ of 150, but given that he hit the ceiling on the test, and is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/1013/6008040a.html">rumored to be</a> in the same IQ league as Gates himself, this is likely an underestimate. &nbsp;Perhaps the best publicly known measure of his IQ is his performance on William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition where he performed even <a href="http://William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition">better than Gates</a>. &nbsp;If <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-did-Steve-Ballmer-get-on-the-Putnam">this source</a> is reliable, Ballmer got one of the 100 best scores on the exam in 1974, but probably not one of the top 45, so let’s split the difference and assume he came in 73rd.</p>
<p>Ballmer was one of the <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005067.html">4,308,000 Americans</a> born in 1956, and assuming almost all of the top math talent from his cohort went on to compete in the 1974 Putman (and whatever shortfall was made up by top foreign talent and by older and younger talent), then …</p></div></div></div>

                     <p>
                        “Bitcoin will see huge price swings before finally settling at the predicted price” Fitzpatrick, MDCitibank.
                     </p>

                     

               
                        <h3>Comparative Trends</h3>
                        <p>
                            Writing in a report named, Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold, Fitzpatrick makes the flood contention 
                            for bitcoin. He says the computerized gold’s present direction gives off an impression of being like that of gold 
                            during the 1970s. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before basic changes were executed in the mid-1970s, gold had gone through 50 years of exchanging 
                            the $20-$35 territory. Notwithstanding, after changes were initiated gold flooded. It as of late contacted another 
                            record-breaking high in Augustprior to settling at just shy of $1,900 per ounce. 
                        </p>
                             
                        <p>
                            As per one report that examined 
                            Fitzpatrick’s paper, it is this “auxiliary change in the advanced money related system that introduced a universe of 
                            monetary indiscipline, deficiencies, and expansion.” Therefore, the Citibank manager contends that bitcoin, which 
                            went to the front in the fallout of the “Incomparable Financial emergency” of 2008-2009, will undoubtedly have a 
                            comparative run. 
                        </p>
               
                        <p>
                            With the Covid-19 pandemic actually draining economies around the globe, governments will keep reacting to the emergency by printing more cash. 
                            This thuslywill profit place of refuge resources that perform well in inflationary periods. 
                        </p>
               
                        <h3>Bitcoin Better Than Gold</h3>
               
                        <p>
                            In any case, Fitzpatrick clarifies that albeit gold is required to profit by the storm of new cash entering dissemination, the 
                            valuable metal has novel constraints that don’t appear to distress bitcoin. In his review, Fitzpatrick notes: 
                        </p><p>
                            Gold has limitations, for example, stockpiling, non-compact, and might be even called ‘the previous news’ regarding a 
                            monetary fence. Bitcoin is the new gold. To help this view, the Citibank supervisor refers to a portion of bitcoin’s 
                            key credits which incorporate the advanced cash’s “restricted gracefully, 
                            simplicity of development across fringes, and hazy proprietorship.” Consequently, Fitzpatrick accepts more 
                            speculators will pick bitcoin over gold thus. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the interim, Fitzpatrick predicts that bitcoin will be exposed to 
                            more administrative limitations going ahead. Be that as it may, dissimilar to other computerized monetary standards, 
                            for example, national bank advanced monetary standards (CBDCs), bitcoin can’t be seized, thus making it a safer 
                            resource.
                        </p>

      <h3>May 31, 2013</h3>
      
      
      <p><img loading="lazy" alt="Skeuo-flat-ic design" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat.jpg" width="1279" height="461" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat.jpg 1279w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat-300x108.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat-554x200.jpg 554w" sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px"></p>
<p>I don’t remember exactly where I first encountered it. But at some point in the past three years, I, along with a large contingent of user interface designers, fans, and industry followers, learned a new word: Skeuomorphic. A skeuomorph in the UI world, so the popular definition goes (even if the rigorous scientific definition of the word <a href="http://www.themachinestarts.com/read/2012-11-how-we-started-calling-visual-metaphors-skeuomorphs-why-apple-design-debate-mess">makes “skeuomorphic design” an oxymoron</a>) is&nbsp;a GUI or elements of a GUI that borrow from a physical analog of their functionality. It seemed like a useful concept in defining the execution of user interfaces, with an added benefit of sounding exotic in conversation – but I think we may have outgrown it.</p>
<h3>Everyone loves a feud</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the way, this newly-popularized concept gained that one thing critical to capturing our collective imagination: a foil. Where skeuomorphism was tied to the familiar, the tactile, the rich, the warm, this dark horse was divorced of the familiar, lived in platonic ideals, was simple, cold, mathematic. Despite drawing most of its theory from the 20th Century’s signature design movement, <a href="http://www.citrinitas.com/history_of_viscom/modernists.html">Modernism</a>, it was nonetheless given its own, rather less impressive (and more prescriptive) name, “<a href="http://designmodo.com/flat-design-principles/">flat design</a>.”</p>
<p>As the story goes, each of these poles had its champion, with Apple raising the varnished-oak banner of its increasingly unified mobile and desktop design language, and Microsoft carrying the solid, rectilinear flag of what was briefly but indelibly called its Metro design language. A war was brewing in the UI design world between flat and skeu: Apple’s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/24/jony-ives-ios-7-flat-design-overhaul-reportedly-features-a-lot-of-black-and-white/">rumored “move to flat”</a> would stir more design-office conversation than a betrayal in Game of Thrones.</p>
<h3>Not so flat</h3>
<p>There is a problem with this narrative. Much of the interaction that users have with iOS devices is with UI elements having no physical analogs apart from the most basic, localized physical metaphor, the button – most of these are even just <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kIFUHwM.png">black Helvetica on a white background</a>. And for all of Microsoft’s eschewing of texture, shading, and object references, one cannot escape that its many boxes and encircled icons ultimately draw affordance from our associations with a physical object, the humble pushbutton.</p>
<p>So if much of iOS is “flat,” and Windows Phone is loaded with a thousand tiny skeuomorphs, what are we left with? An important realization: “Flat design” is not nearly as flat as it looks. Skeuomorphism is a critical part of interaction design, and is everywhere.</p>
<p>How, then, do we verbalize the many clear differences between the examples of iOS and Windows Phone? The answer is to build a more nuanced framework than “flat” versus “skeuomorphism.”</p>
<h3>Building a more useful vocabulary</h3>
<p>Instead of imagining a fun-to-follow, yet ultimately empty battle between the forces of skeuomorphism and flat design, a more productive pursuit would be to construct a vocabulary around the toolset these concepts offer. Here are a few tools I see:</p>
<h4>Functional object reference (“skeuomorphism”)</h4>
<div id="attachment_413"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-413" loading="lazy" alt="object" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-413">Propellerhead Reason, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Windows Phone 8 dialer</p></div>
<p>This is the sort of visual metaphor that ties an object from the physical world to a virtual tool. Ideally it is for purposes of building affordance from familiarity (turning pages in iBooks), but it can easily be misused (non-functional pages in iOS Address Book). Regardless of how realistically it’s rendered, a physical object can be useful as a reference so long as it is recognizable by the user and responds in the same way.</p>
<h4>Material/texture reference</h4>
<div id="attachment_414"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-414" loading="lazy" alt="texture" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-414">Apple Game Center, Quantum WordPress theme from Themesorter, artist’s rendition of 1990s CD-ROM menu</p></div>
<p>The difference between this (which you may call skeuomorphism as well; I won’t stop you) and the previous example is that the metaphor is implicit, if present at all. Ideally, there is some implied metaphor: Apple’s Game Center may not actually play backgammon, but its material references to a vintage board game case can put the user’s mind in a conceptual space for gaming. Often, this tool is simply used for decoration, but tasteful decoration can still aid user experience.</p>
<h4>Depth cues</h4>
<div id="attachment_415"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-415" loading="lazy" alt="depth" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-415">Apple Notification Center settings, Apple Maps, GitHub for Mac</p></div>
<p>Whereas the previous two tools always use concrete references, depth cues may or may not have such a clear analog. Their primary purpose is to imply what can be done if the user interacts with the controls they adorn, not referencing real objects themselves, but rather mechanical aspects of them.</p>
<h4>Shape / color cues</h4>
<div id="attachment_428"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-428" loading="lazy" alt="Calvetica settings, Android lock screen, Solve for iOS" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-428">Calvetica settings, Android lock screen, Solve for iOS</p></div>
<p>Contrasts in shape and color are often used in conjunction with depth cues to further increase contrast and create visual hierarchy. The trend of “flat design” is to use them with minimal application of the other aforementioned tools, which can be successful so long as the application of shape and color contrasts are sufficient to create an affordance of user action.</p>
<h3>Addition and subtraction</h3>
<p>My current one-liner for when the subject comes up is <a href="https://twitter.com/claymill/status/328995618523578371">“‘flat design’ is approximately as useful a term for user interfaces as ‘red design’ or ’round design.'”</a> Far from being a shot at the popular aesthetic of relying heavily on it, though, it’s meant to provoke thought: Flatness and depth are tools, just like color and shape, affordances and analogs.</p>
<p>Don’t just practice flat design or skeuomorphic design. Use the tools that are right for the interface that’s right for your users.</p>

<p><em>Branch</em> is an online magazine written by and for people who dream of a sustainable and just internet for all.</p>



<p>We believe that the internet must serve our collective liberation and ecological sustainability. We want the internet to dismantle the power structures that delay climate action and for the internet itself to become a sustainable and positive force for climate justice.</p>



<p>We see this magazine as a space for personal reflection, critical engagement with technology and internet economics, as well as experimentation and storytelling.&nbsp;Creating change requires all kinds of practices—art and design, professional development, civic participation, policy and advocacy, imagination and positive visions for our future. This is our small attempt at sharing what inspires and challenges us towards a sustainable and just internet for all.  </p>



<p><em>Branch</em> is available online and perhaps later in print as a stand-alone magazine or a supplement for other publications.</p>



<h2>The first issue</h2>



<p>The first issue of <em>Branch</em> looks at underlying structural issues of the climate crisis and its inequalities. We seek to go beyond tech solutionism and towards intersectional climate justice work. We strive to connect sustainability to root causes and to inequalities experienced at different intersections—gender, race, class, ability, and so on. </p>



<p>This issue features visions for a more sustainable internet as well as practical efforts to get us there. We hope to not only articulate what these desirable futures are, but also to embody them with specific tools and art. Contributors include climate activists, open source technologists, indigenous leaders, artists, energy scientists and degrowth experts.</p>



<h2>Future Issues</h2>



<p>The next issue of Branch will be released in spring 2021. If you are interested in contributing, we would love to hear from you. <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Projects/Sustainability/Magazine#Call_for_submissions">Learn more about how to submit an article.</a> </p>



<p>We would also welcome opportunities to distribute the magazine and talk about these issues with you.</p>

		<p>Recently I had a chat with the excellent <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery Lancey</a>, about Kubernetes. Specifically, what we would do differently if we built something new, from the ground up, with no regard for compatibility with Kubernetes. I found that conversation so stimulating that I feel the need to write things down, so here we are.</p>

<p>Before we get started, I want to stress a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a fully formed design. Some of these things may not work at all, or require significant redesign. Each section is one random piece of the entire puzzle.</li>
<li>These are not solely my ideas. Some I <em>think</em> are original, but like many things in the Kubernetes community it’s the product of collective thinking. I know at least <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maisem_ali">Maisem Ali</a> have influenced my thinking at one time or another, and I’m forgetting many more. If you like an idea, it was a group effort. If you hate it, it’s entirely mine.</li>
<li>Some of these things are polarizing. I’m designing something that makes <em>me</em> happy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding principles</h2>

<p>My experience of Kubernetes comes from two very different places: authoring <a href="https://www.metallb.org/">MetalLB</a> for bare metal clusters, and operating a large fleet of clusters-as-a-service in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE SRE</a>. Both of these taught me that Kubernetes is extremely complex, and that most people who are trying to use it are not prepared for the sheer amount of work that lies between the marketing brochure and the system those brochures promise.</p>

<p>MetalLB taught me that it’s not possible to build robust software that integrates with Kubernetes. I think MetalLB makes a damn good go of it, but Kubernetes still makes it far too easy to construct broken configurations, and far too hard to debug them. GKE SRE taught me that even the foremost Kubernetes experts cannot safely operate Kubernetes at scale. (Although GKE SRE does a spectacular job with the tools they’re given.)</p>

<p>Kubernetes is the C++ of orchestration software. Immensely powerful, includes all the features, looks deceptively simple, and <em>will</em> hurt you repeatedly until you join its priesthood and devote your life to its mysteries. And even then, the matrix of possible ways to configure and deploy it is so large that you’re never on firm footing.</p>

<p>Continuing that analogy, my guide star is Go. If Kubernetes is C++, what would the Go of orchestration systems look like? Aggressively simple, opinionated, grown slowly and warily, and you can learn it in under a week and get on with what you were actually trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>With that, let’s get going. Starting with Kubernetes, and with a license to completely and utterly break compatibility, what would I do?</p>

<h2 id="mutable-pods">Mutable pods</h2>

<p>In Kubernetes, pods are mostly (but not entirely) immutable after creation. If you want to change a pod, you don’t. Make a new one and delete the old one. This is unlike most other things in Kubernetes, which are mostly mutable and gracefully reconcile towards the new spec.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to make pods be not special. Make them entirely read-write, and reconcile them like you would any other object.</p>

<p>The immediately useful thing I get from that is in-place restarts. If scheduling constraints and resource allocations haven’t changed, guess what? SIGTERM runc, restart runc with different parameters, and you’re done. Now pods look like regular old systemd services, that can move between machines <em>if necessary</em>.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn’t require doing mutability at the runtime layer. If you change a pod definition, it’s still mostly fine to terminate the container and restart it with a new configuration. The pod is still holding onto the resource reservation that got it scheduled onto this machine, so conceptually it’s equivalent to <code>systemctl restart blah.service</code>. You could try to be fancy and make some operations actually update in place at the runtime level as well, but don’t have to. The main benefit is decoupling scheduling, pod lifetime, and lifetime at the runtime layer.</p>

<h2 id="version-control-all-the-things">Version control all the things</h2>

<p>Sticking at the pod layer for a bit longer: now that they’re mutable, the next obvious thing I want is rollbacks. For that, let’s keep old versions of pod definitions around, and make it trivial to “go back to version N”.</p>

<p>Now, a pod update looks like: write an updated definition of the pod, and it updates to match. Update broken? Write back version N-1, and you’re done.</p>

<p>Bonus things you get from this: a diffable history of what happened to your cluster, without needing GitOps nonsense. By all means keep the GitOps nonsense if you want, it has benefits, but you can answer a basic “what changed?” question using only data in the cluster.</p>

<p>This needs a bit more design. In particular, I want to separate out external changes (human submits a new pod) from mechanical changes (some internals of k8s alter a pod definition). I haven’t thought through how to encode both those histories and make both accessible to operators and automation. Maybe it could also be completely generic, wherein a “changer” identifies itself when submitting a new version, and you can then query for changes by or excluding particular changers (think similar to how label queries work at the minute). Again, more design needed there, I just know that I want versioned objects with an accessible history.</p>

<p>We’ll need garbage collection eventually. That said, changes to single pods should delta-compress really well, so my default would be to just keep everything until it becomes a truly dumb amount of data, and figure something out at that point. Keeping everything also acts as a useful mild pressure to avoid “death by a thousand changes” in the rest of the system. Prefer to have fewer, more meaningful changes over a flurry of control loops each changing one field in pursuit of convergence.</p>

<p>Once we have this history, we can do some neat minor things too. For example, the node software could keep container images for the last N versions pinned to the machine, so that rollbacks are as fast as they can possibly be. With an accessible history, you can do this more precisely than “GC older than 30 days and hope”. Generalizing, all the orchestration software can use older versions as GC roots for various resources, to make rollbacks faster. Rollbacks being the primary way of ending outages, this is a very valuable thing to have.</p>

<h2 id="replace-deployment-with-pinneddeployment">Replace Deployment with PinnedDeployment</h2>

<p>This is a short section to basically say that <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> knocked it out of the park with her <a href="https://timewitch.net/post/2019-12-30-pinneddeployments/">PinnedDeployment</a> resource, which lets operators explicitly control a rollout by tracking 2 versions of the deployment state. It’s a deployment object designed by an SRE, with a crisp understanding of what SREs want in a deployment. I love it.</p>

<p>This combines super well with the versioned, in-place pod updates above, and I really don’t have anything to add. It’s clearly how multi-pod things should work. There’s probably some tweaking required to adapt from the Kubernetes-constrained world to this new wonderful unconstrained universe, but the general design is perfect.</p>

<h2 id="explicit-orchestration-workflows">Explicit orchestration workflows</h2>

<p>The biggest issue I have with the “API machinery” bits of Kubernetes is the idea of orchestration as a loose choreography of independent control loops. On the surface, this seems like a nice idea: you have dozens of little control loops, each focused on doing one small thing. When combined in a cluster, they indirectly cooperate with each other to push the state forward and converge on the desired end state. So, what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The problem is that it’s entirely impossible to debug when it goes wrong. A typical failure mode in Kubernetes is that you submit a change to the cluster, then repeatedly refresh waiting for stuff to converge. When it doesn’t… Well, you’re screwed. Kubernetes doesn’t know the difference between “the system has converged successfully” and “a control loop is wedged and is blocking everything else.” You can hope that the offending control loop posted some events to the object to help you, but by and large they don’t.</p>

<p>At which point your only option is to cat the logs of every control loop that might be involved, looking for the one that was wedged. You can make this a bit faster if you have intimate knowledge of all the control loops and what each one does, because that lets you infer from the object’s current state which loop might be trying to run right now.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the complexity has been shifted from the designer of the control loop to the cluster operator. It’s easy (though not trivial) to make a control loop that does a dinky little thing in isolation. But to operate a cluster with dozens of these control loops requires the operator to assimilate the behavior of all of them, their interactions with each other, and try to reason about an extremely loosely coupled system. This is a problem because you have to write and test the control loop once, but work with it and its bugs many more times. And yet, the bias is to simplify the thing you only do once.</p>

<p>To fix this, I would look to systemd. It solves for a similar lifecycle problem: given a current state and a target, how do you get from A to B? The difference is that in systemd, the steps and their dependencies are made explicit. You <em>tell</em> systemd that your unit is a required part of <code>multi-user.target</code> (aka “normally-booted happy system”), that it must run after filesystems have been mounted, but before networking it brought up, and so forth. You can also depend on other concrete parts of the system, for example to say that your thing needs to run whenever sshd is running (sounds like a sidecar, right?).</p>

<p>The net result of this is that systemd can tell you precisely what piece of the system malfunctioned, or is still working on its thing, or failed a precondition. It can also print you a graph of the system’s boot process, and analyze it for things like “what’s the long pole of bootup?”</p>

<p>I want to steal all this wholesale, and plop it into my cluster orchestration …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-book-covers" id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stejpang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/25/build-your-own-block-on.html">Build your own block_on()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">Build your own executor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the
scope and introduce an example that can easily be explored further.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot to digest and it's not what I would call easy, but we'll
take everything step by step so get a cup of tea and relax.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Static quantization quantizes the weights and activations of the model. It allows the user to fuse activations into preceding layers where possible. Unlike <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Dynamic-Quantization/">dynamic quantization</a>, where the scales and zero points were collected during inference, the scales and zero points for static quantization were determined prior to inference using a representative dataset. Therefore, static quantization is theoretically faster than dynamic quantization while the model size and memory bandwidth consumptions remain to be the same. Therefore, statically quantized models are more favorable for inference than dynamic quantization models.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do static quantizations. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">“Quantization for Neural Networks”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-static-quantization">PyTorch Static Quantization</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow could be as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a static quantization wrapper. However, without doing layer fusion, sometimes such kind of easy manipulation would not result in good model performances.</p>



<p>In this case, I would like to use the ResNet18 from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">TorchVision models</a> as an example. I will do post-training quantization with and without layer fusion and compare their performances. The source code could also be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Static-Quantization">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>Because ResNet has skip connections addition and this addition in the TorchVision implementation uses <code>+</code>. We would have to replace this <code>+</code> (<code>torch.add</code> equivalence) with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/torch.nn.quantized.html?highlight=floatfunctional#torch.nn.quantized.FloatFunctional"><code>FloatFunctional.add</code></a> (<code>torch.add</code> + <code>torch.nn.Identity</code> equivalence) in the model definition. This is because <code>torch.nn.Identity</code> serves as a flag for activation quantization. Without it, there will be no activation quantization for skip connection additions, resulting in erroneous quantization calibration.</p>



<p>In addition, we would like to test layer fusions, such as fusing <code>Conv2D</code>, <code>BatchNorm</code>, and <code>ReLU</code>. To do layer fusion, the <code>torch.nn.Module</code> name could not overlap. Otherwise it will cause erroneous quantization calibration. For example, in ordinary FP32 model, we could define one parameter-free <code>relu = torch.nn.ReLU()</code> and reuse this <code>relu</code> module everywhere. However, if we want to fuse some specific <code>ReLU</code>s, the <code>ReLU</code> modules have to be explicitly separated. So in this case, we will have to define <code>relu1 = torch.nn.ReLU()</code>, <code>relu2 = torch.nn.ReLU()</code>, etc. Sometimes, layer fusion is compulsory, since there are no quantized layer implementations corresponding to some floating point layers, such as <code>BatchNorm</code>.</p>



<p>Taken together, the modified ResNet module definition <code>resnet.py</code> is as follows.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When someone uses their browser to visit your website, the browser fetches files from your website's server. One example could be a CSS file. Once the CSS file has been fetched, the browser can cache (store) a copy of it. This means that, as the visitor browses your site, the CSS does not need to be fetched once again from the server.</p><p>The advantages of caching a file are: one less network request per page load, less use of the visitor's internet data, and faster load times. Additionally, CSS is a blocking resource. This means that while it is being fetched and loaded, other files have to wait to be loaded. So, the quicker CSS can be loaded, the quicker a visitor can enjoy your site.</p><p>It is important to note once again that the <strong>files cached by the browser are copies</strong>. This means that if a file living on your server is updated, the browser might not know about it. Therefore, a visitor might get the outdated copy of that file, rather than the updated one. The file will still load fast, as it is coming from the browser cache, but it will be outdated.</p><h2>How do servers manage files?</h2><p>The server you're using to serve your website determines which of your site's resources are cached, and how they are cached. There are many different server options available. For the rest of this post, I'll talk about the one hosting the post you are reading - Netlify.</p><p>Netlify has default cache settings. This means that with no effort on my part, I can write my website, deploy it, and share it without needing to worry about configuring cache settings. There is a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/23/better-living-through-caching/">blog post about Netlify's default cache settings entitled "Better Living Through Caching"</a>.</p><p>I briefly mentioned earlier the issue of getting an outdated file from the cache. Netlify admit that "cache invalidation is one of the hardest problems in computer science" and that they have found a way around this issue:</p><blockquote><strong>“max-age=0, must-revalidate, public”</strong> = “please cache this content, and then do not trust your cache”. This seems a bit counterintuitive, but there’s a good reason. This favors you as a content creator — you can change any of your content in an instant.</blockquote><p>So, no visitors will be served outdated files. However, all files are re-requested on every single page load. This would be no good, except that Netlify uses "e-tags". These are hash values (long strings of unique characters). The server and browser share the e-tags. If a file changes on the server, for example a CSS file, the e-tag value changes, the browser notices, and the changed file is requested.</p><p>Additionally, Netlify makes the constant checking of files faster using their CDN (content delivery network) and HTTP/2. Please look up these two things, as discussing them is beyond the scope of this post.</p><h2>Trust, then verify</h2><p>It is a really nice thing in modern web development to be able to enjoy stuff done for you automatically by your browser and server. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't know how it all works, though.</p><p>If a server such as Netlify offers default cache settings, it pays to look up what they are, and how they work. A server's default cache settings are unlikely to be the best for <strong>every</strong> website.</p><p>If it is necessary to change cache settings for your website, look up how to manually create your own settings. Here is a <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/#custom-headers">post on how Netlify users can set custom cache headers</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

    <article>
  
  <p>Nov 11, 2020</p>
  <p>Some time ago I wrote a reddit comment explaining the benefits of IDEs.
Folks refer to it from time to time, so I decided to edit it into an article form.
Enjoy!</p>
<p>I think I have a rather balanced perspective on IDEs.
I used to be a heavy Emacs user (<a href="https://github.com/matklad/.emacs.d/tree/475de5db99f8729c57fed7e6fde4cd06f5ccb62f">old config</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/d555642a5a9e4e8b0ca0c77f188ffd976f06327c/home/.emacs.d/init.el">current config</a>).
I worked at JetBrains on <a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust">IntelliJ Rust</a> for several years.
I used evil mode and vim for a bit, and tried tmux and kakoune.
Nowadays, I primarily use VS Code to develop <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/">rust-analyzer</a>: LSP-based editor-independent IDE backend for Rust.</p>
<p>I will be focusing on IntelliJ family of IDEs, as I believe these are the most advanced IDEs today.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature of IntelliJ is semantic understanding of code.
The core of IntelliJ is a compiler which parses, type checks and otherwise understands your code.
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PostIntelliJ.html">PostIntelliJ</a> is the canonical post about this.
That article also refutes the claim that “Smalltalk IDE is the best we’ve ever had”.</p>
<p>Note that “semantic understanding” is mostly unrelated to the traditional interpretation of “IDE” as <em>Integrated</em> Development Environment.
I personally don’t feel that the “Integrated” bit is all that important.
I commit&amp;push from the command line using Julia scripts, rebase in magit, and do code reviews in a browser.
If anything, there’s an ample room for improvement for the integration bits.
For me, <strong>I</strong> in “<strong>I</strong>DE” stands for “intelligent”, smart.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this terminology difference.
I feel it is a common source of misunderstanding.
“Unix and command line can do anything an IDE can do” is correct about integrated bits, but is wrong about semantical bits.</p>
<p>Traditional editors like Vim or Emacs understand programming languages very approximately, mostly via regular expressions.
For me, this feels very wrong.
It’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">common knowledge</a> that HTML shall not be parsed with regex.
Yet this is exactly what happens every time one does <code>vim index.html</code> with syntax highlighting on.
I sincerely think that almost every syntax highlighter out there is wrong and we, as an industry, should do better.
I also understand that this is a tall order, but I do my best to change the status quo here :-)</p>
<p>These are mostly theoretical concerns though.
The question is, does semantic understanding help in practice?
I am pretty sure that it is non-essential, especially for smaller code bases.
My <a href="https://github.com/matklad/rustraytracer">first non-trivial Rust program</a> was written in Emacs, and it was fine.
Most of rust-analyzer was written using pretty spartan IDE support.
There are a lot of insanely-productive folks who are like “sometimes I type vim, sometimes I type vi, they are sufficiently similar”.
Regex-based syntax highlighting and regex based fuzzy symbol search (<a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">ctags</a>) get you a really long way.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that features unlocked by deep understanding of the language help.
The funniest example here is extend/shrink selection.
This features allows you to extend current selection to the next encompassing syntactic construct.
It’s the simplest feature a PostIntelliJ IDE can have, it only needs the parser.
But it is sooo helpful when writing code, it just completely blows vim’s text objects out of the water, especially when combined with multiple cursors.
In a sense, this is structural editing which works for text.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98809232-80e3db00-241d-11eb-883a-5aece9a1dbfc.gif" alt="98809232 80e3db00 241d 11eb 883a 5aece9a1dbfc">
</p>
</div>
<p>If you add further knowledge of the language into a mix, you’ll get the “assists” system: micro-refactoring which available in a particular context.
For example, is the cursor is on a comma in a list of function arguments, you can <span><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd></span> &gt; “swap arguments”, and the order of arguments will be changed in the declaration and on various call-sites as well.
(See <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/09/28/how-to-make-a-light-bulb.html">this post</a> to learn how assists are implemented).</p>
<p>These small dwim things add up to a really nice editing experience, where you mostly express the intention, and the IDE deals with boring syntactical aspects of code editing:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98812121-37e25580-2422-11eb-8541-2c5a32926845.gif" alt="98812121 37e25580 2422 11eb 8541 2c5a32926845">
</p>
</div>
<p>For larger projects, complex refactors are a huge time-saver.
Doing project-wide renames and signature changes automatically and without thinking reduces the cost of keeping the code clean.</p>
<p>Another transformative experience is navigation.
In IntelliJ, you generally don’t “open a file”.
Instead you think directly in terms of functions, types and modules, and navigate to those using file structure, goto symbol, to do definition/implementation/type, etc:</p>

<p>When I used Emacs, I really admired its buffer management facilities, because they made opening a file I want a breeze.
When I later switched to IntelliJ, I stopped thinking in terms of a set of opened files altogether.
I disabled editor tabs and started using editor splits less often — you don’t need bookmarks if you can just find things.</p>
<p>For me, there’s one aspect of traditional editors which is typically not matched in IDEs out of the box — basic cursor motion.
Using arrow keys for that is slow and flow-breaking, because one needs to move the hand from the home row.
Even Emacs' horrific <kbd>C-p</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> are a big improvement, and vim’s <kbd>hjkl</kbd> go even further.
One fix here is to configure each tool to use your favorite shortcuts, but this is a whack-a-mole game.
What I do is remapping <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to act as an extra modifier, such that <kbd>ijkl</kbd> <strong>are</strong> arrow keys.
(There are also keyboards with <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">hardware</a> <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">support</a> for this).
This works in all applications the same way.
Easy motion / ace jump functionality for jumping to any visible character is also handy, and usually is available <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9803-acejump-lite">via</a> <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper">a plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Recent advancements with LSP protocol promise to give one the best of both worlds, where semantic-aware backend and light-weight editor frontend are different processes, which can be mixed and matched.
This is nice in theory, but not as nice in practice as IntelliJ yet, mostly because IntelliJ is way more polished.</p>
<p>To give a simple example, in IntelliJ for “go to symbol by fuzzy name” functionality, I can filter the search scope by:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is this my code/code from a dependency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is this test/production code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a symbol a type-like thing, or a method-like thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>path to the module where the symbol is defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>VS Code and LSP simply do not have capabilities for such filters yet, they have to be bolted on using hacks.
Support for LSP in other editors is even more hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>LSP did achieve a significant breakthrough — it made people care about implementing IDE backends.
Experience shows that re-engineering an existing compiler to power an IDE is often impossible, or isomorphic to a rewrite.
How a compiler talks to an editor is the smaller problem.
The hard one is building a compiler that can do IDE stuff in the first place.
Check out <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">this post</a> for some of the technical details.
Starting with this use-case in mind saves a lot of effort down the road.</p>
<p>This I think is a big deal.
I hypothesize that the reason why IDEs do not completely dominate tooling landscape is the lack of good IDE backends.</p>
<p>If we look at the set of languages fairly popular recently, a significant fraction of them is dynamically typed: PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby.
The helpfulness of an IDE for dynamically typed languages is severely limited: while approximations and heuristics can get you a long way, you still need humans in the loop to verify IDE’s guesses.</p>
<p>There’s C++, but its templates are effectively dynamically typed, with exactly the same issues (and a very complex base language to boot).
Curiously, C looks like a language for which implementing a near-perfect IDE is pretty feasible.
I don’t know why it didn’t happen before CLion.</p>
<p>This leaves C# and Java.
Indeed, these languages are dominated by IDEs.
There’s a saying that you can’t write Java without an IDE.
I think it gets the causation direction backwards: Java is one of the few languages for which it is possible to implement a great IDE without great pain.
Supporting evidence here is Go.
According to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2019-results#TOC_5.">survey results</a>, text editors are stably declining in popularity in favor of IDEs.</p>
<p>I think this is because Go actually has good IDEs.
This is possible because the language is sufficiently statically typed for an IDE to be a marked improvement.
Additionally, the language is very simple, so the amount of work you need to put in to make a decent IDE is much lower than for other languages.
If you have something like JavaScript…​
Well, you first need to build an alternative language for which you can actually implement an IDE (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>) and only then you can build the IDE itself (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VS Code</a>).</p>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.</p><p>Today we’re going to talk about a deceptively simple topic: clock synchronization. I think there’s nothing like trying to write computer programs to manipulate time to convince you that time is an incredibly complicated thing, and it’s complicated in like 16 different ways, from time zones to leap seconds to all sorts of other crazy things, but one of the really interesting corners of this world is how do you get all of the clocks on your big computer network to roughly agree with each other? In other words, clock synchronization.</p><p>So we’re going to talk about that with Chris Perl, who’s a sysadmin, who’s worked at Jane Street since 2012. Chris is better than anyone I have ever worked with, at diving into the horrible details of complex systems and understanding how they work and how they can be made to work better, and he’s done a lot of work here, specifically on clock synchronization, and has, in the course of that, redone our entire system for doing clock synchronization, so he’s had an opportunity to really learn a lot about the topic. Chris, to get started, can you give us just a quick overview of how computer clocks work in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="000115">00:01:15</h2>

<p>So, I guess the rough gist is something like you have some oscillator, a little crystal effectively that’s inside the computer that is oscillating at some frequency, and that’s driving an interrupt that the operating system is going to handle in some level – there’s probably lots of details here that I’m just skipping over – but that’s driving an interrupt that’s going happen in the operating system. And the operating system is using that to derive its notion of time, and so if you have a really high-quality oscillator, and those timer interrupts happen at the right rate so that you’re tracking real-time that might just happen, and if your oscillator’s very good, and very stable you could actually just be pretty close to the correct time just by virtue of that. But the truth is that most computers come with fairly bad oscillators and they change their frequencies for various reasons like heat, so if you are using your computer to compile the Linux kernel or something like that, that could change the heat profile, change the frequency of the oscillator, and actually change how well you’re doing of keeping real time.</p>

<h2 id="000205">00:02:05</h2>

<p>When we naively think of clock synchronization as people, we think of it as like, “I’m going to go set my clock”. I’m going to look at what time it is and adjust my clock to match whatever real-time is, but you’re actually talking about a different thing here. You’re talking not just about setting what the right time is right now but keeping that time correct, essentially keeping the rate at which time is going forward in sync.</p>

<h2 id="000224">00:02:24</h2>

<p>Correct. You’d love it if you could get like a really, really high-quality oscillator for super cheap in all your computers and then you wouldn’t need a lot of adjustment to get them to keep the correct time, but that would be really expensive. You can buy such things, they just cost a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="000237">00:02:37</h2>

<p>So, you say that heat and various other things that are going on in the computer will cause this rate at which time is appearing to march forward inside of your computer to drift around. How accurate are these? Can give me a kind of numerical sense of how far these things drift away?</p>

<h2 id="000253">00:02:53</h2>

<p>The stuff that we run, we capture some of these statistics, we see machines that have a frequency correction applied to them of, say, 50 parts per million, which is like microseconds per second, so that works out to roughly a couple seconds per day, is how you would wind up drifting off. But I’m sure that if you had a super old desktop under your desk, that you stole from your parents or something and you were trying to rebuild into a Linux box, you might have worse numbers than that. Like a sort of relatively current generation server from a well-known vendor, you’re talking somewhere around 50 to 100 microseconds per second that they can sort of walk-off out of alignment.</p>

<h2 id="000327">00:03:27</h2>

<p>Okay, so clock synchronization is the process of trying to get all of those clocks that you have across your whole data center and across multiple data centers to be in sync with each other. Is that the right way of thinking about it?</p>

<h2 id="000339">00:03:39</h2>

<p>I think so. “In sync”, is an interesting sort of thing to say, right? You kind of would like that if you were able to instantaneously ask two random servers on your network, what time it was at the same exact point in time, if you could somehow magically do that, that they would agree to some relatively small margin of error, and I think that that’s kind of what we mean by clock synchronization. That if you could somehow magically freeze time and go ask every single computer on your network, “Hey. What time do you think it is?” that they would all roughly agree to within some error bound that you can define.</p>

<h2 id="000413">00:04:13</h2>

<p>Right. And this basic model actually assumes that there is a well-defined notion of what it means to be instantaneously at the same time, which isn’t exactly true because of relativity and stuff like that, but we’re going to mostly ignore that. So, I guess one property that you’re highlighting here is having the clocks agree with each other, and that’s part of it, but there’s another piece, right, which is having the clocks agree with some external reference. There’s some notion of like, what does the world think the time is? So, where does that external reference come from?</p>

<h2 id="000435">00:04:35</h2>

<div><p>I’m not an expert on this stuff, but I’ll give you the sort of 10,000-foot view. You have various physics laboratories all over the world, like NPL in the UK, and other places across the world. They all have measurements of what they think time is, using things like hydrogen masers and sort of very accurate atomic methods. They contribute all of that stuff to a single source who kind of averages it, or does some sort of weighting, to come up with what the correct time is, and then you kind of magic that over to the Air Force, who then sends it up to the GPS constellation. And GPS has a mechanism for getting time from the GPS satellites down to GPS receivers, and so if you’re a person who runs a computer network and you’re interested in synchronizing your clocks to a relatively high degree of accuracy with something like UTC, which is effectively Greenwich Mean Time, it is just sort of the current time without time zones applied. </p><p>If you’re interested in doing that, what you can do is you can just go out to a vendor and you can buy a thing called a GPS appliance, which can hook up to a little antenna that goes onto the roof. It can receive this signal from the GPS constellation and basically gives you out time, and the accuracy there is something like maybe 100 nanoseconds or so. So you’ve got the sort of atomic measurements being fed up to a GPS constellation, down to GPS receivers that you, as an operator of a computer network, can buy.</p></div>

<h2 id="000557">00:05:57</h2>

<p>And for the purposes of this conversation, we’re going to treat those GPS receivers as the received wisdom as to what time it is, and our job is to figure out how, inside of a computer network, you make all of the different devices agree with each other and agree with that external reference.</p>

<h2 id="000611">00:06:11</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="000612">00:06:12</h2>

<p>Why is it important? What does having synchronized clocks help you do?</p>

<h2 id="000622">00:06:22</h2>

<p>If you put yourself in the shoes of a financial regulatory authority, and you have all these different participants out there doing stuff with computer systems, and something weird happens, and you’d like to come up with a total ordering of events of what led to this crazy thing – or what led to this good thing, who knows – but you want to have a total ordering of events. If people don’t have good clock synchronization, to some external source, you can’t compare the timestamp from participant A to the timestamp from participant B, so if you were to decree everybody must have time that is within some error bound, you know if these timestamps are within that error bound, well, then I can’t be sure about the ordering, but if they’re farther away than that then I can be sure about the ordering. I can know which one came first and which one came second, and that can be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="000655">00:06:55</h2>

<p>So that’s the motivation that’s very specific to our industry, but don’t people in other industries care a lot about clock synchronization, too? I would have thought that there are other reasons that would drive you to want to synchronize the machines on the network.</p>

<h2 id="000706">00:07:06</h2>

<p>Oh, sure. There’s lots of different things. I mean, just like a general sysadmin topic, a lot of times you want to gather logs from all the systems on your computer network, and you want to analyze them for various reasons. Maybe it’s because you’re concerned about intruders. Or maybe it’s because you’re just trying to understand the way things are functioning, and if your clocks aren’t synchronized it’s very hard to kind of understand things that might have happened on system B and how they relate to system A because the two timestamps are just not – you just can’t compare them if they’re not synchronized.</p>

<h2 id="000733">00:07:33</h2>

<p>And I suppose there are also some distributed systems, algorithmic reasons to want clocks. Certainly, some kinds of distributed algorithms end up using clocks as ways of breaking ties between systems, and so that requires at least some reasonable level of synchronization.</p>

<h2 id="000745">00:07:45</h2>

<p>For sure. There’s also other network protocols that are widely used that require clock synchronization, but much less precise levels of clock synchronization. Kerberos is a widely used authentication protocol, and that requires that the clocks be synchronized to within five minutes, and the idea there is to thwart replay attacks, and stuff like that, making …</p></div></div>

        <section>
            <p>It’s been a while since we shared the story of an incident with you, and that’s probably a good thing –
most operational incidents we had in the past year were “boring” enough in nature to fix them easily.
This time, we’ve got a story of a data loss, caused by pure and simple human error – and the story of
how we recovered the data.</p>

<p>Even though it is quite embarrassing how the data loss happened, we think it’s worth sharing the story
of its recovery, as it might allow you to learn a few useful things in case you ever end up in a
similar situation.</p>

<p>As you might have seen, over the last 7 months we’ve extended our offerings beyond ticketing to allow
our customers to transform their events into the digital space as long as the global pandemic makes
traditional event formats impossible. The result of our effort is a joint venture called 
<a href="https://venueless.org/">Venueless</a> that you should absolutely check out if you haven’t yet.</p>

<p>One component of the virtual events we run on venueless is <strong>live video streaming</strong>. In this process,
our customers use a tool like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> or <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>
to create a live video stream. The stream is then sent to an <strong>encoding server</strong> of ours via RTMP.
On the encoding server, we re-encode the stream into different quality levels and then distribute
it to our very own tiny streaming CDN.</p>

<p>Venueless currently does <strong>not yet</strong> include a video-on-demand component and usually, our customers record
their content at the source, e.g. with OBS or StreamYard, and process or publish them on their own.
However, just to be safe, we keep a recording of the incoming stream as well. This isn’t currently
part of our promoted service offering, we rather see it as a free backup service to our clients in case they
lose their recording. Given that we already consider it to just be a backup, we currently don’t make any
further backups of this data.</p>

<h4 id="data-loss">Data loss</h4>

<p>Usually, we delete these recordings after a while, but in some cases, our customers ask us to get them, e.g.
because their own recording failed, or because StreamYard only records the first 8 hours of every
stream. Since this doesn’t happen a lot, it’s not yet an automated process in our system. Whenever a customer
requests a recording we SSH into the respective encoding server and move the recording file to a
directory that’s accessible through HTTP, like this:</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-12345.flv public/
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it, we share the link with the customer, and the process is done. One of the simplest steps possible
in all this. Yesterday, a customer asked us for the recordings of the two last streams of their event. Just
before finishing up for the week, I wanted to supply them with the required file, SSH’d into the server,
looked for the correct files and typed…</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-16678.flv recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Oops.</strong> I hit return before typing out <code>public/</code>, and therefore replaced the last stream with the
second-last, losing one of the videos.</p>

<h4 id="damage-control">Damage control</h4>

<p>Having a very naive understanding of how file systems work, I knew that the <code>mv</code> command has only
changed the directory listing of the file system, but hasn’t actually wiped the file from the disk,
so I knew there is likely still a chance to recover the file, if it’s not overwritten by something
else in the meantime.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t manage to re-mount the root partition as read-only to avoid further damage softly,
I used the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">big hammer</a> to remount
everything read-only immediately:</p>

<pre><code># echo u &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger
</code></pre>

<p>Uhm, okay, this worked, but how do I install any data recovery tools now? After some experiments,
I decided it would be easiest to reboot into the recovery system provided by our server provider
<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. So I configured the boot loader to boot their recovery system
from the network and forcefully rebooted the server.</p>

<p>To be able to perform disk dumps and have some operational flexibility without downloading a 2 TB
disk image to my local machine (which would take rougly a week), I also quickly purchased
a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Hetzner Storage Box</a> with 5 TB space.</p>

<h4 id="failed-attempts">Failed attempts</h4>

<p>Just before I executed my fatal <code>mv</code> command, I executed <code>ls -lisah</code> to get a directory listing
of the files:</p>

<pre><code>3146449 1.1G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.1G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16678.flv
3146113 1.6G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.6G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p>This meant I <strong>knew</strong> the inode number of the deleted file! As I mentioned before, my understanding
of file systems was (and is) rather naive, and I was pretty optimistic to be able to recover the
file using that information. Isn’t that sort of what a journaling file system is for?</p>

<p>Recovering the file this way hover appeared to be impossible. <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html">ext4magic</a>
and <a href="http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/">extundelete</a> are powerful tools that did find some 
deleted files on my disk – but not the one I was looking for, even after trying different options
for over two hours.</p>

<p>I did not spend the time to really understand how ext4 works, but from what I gathered from various
blogs, I was pretty much out of luck since the inode did no longer contain the relevant information
and ext4magic also wasn’t able to <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html#Recovery_process_5">recover the neccessary information from the journal</a>
either.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However, if you’re in a similar situation – the ext4magic how-tos are really helpful and worth a try.</p>

<h4 id="successful-recovery">Successful recovery</h4>

<p>There is this one other approach to file recovery that is often recommended on the internet, usually
for “small text files”: Just <code>grep</code> your whole disk for known parts of its contents! So why wouldn’t
this work on larger non-text files as well?</p>

<p>The first problem is obviously what to grep for. The only thing I know about the missing file, apart
from its rough size, is that it’s a FLV video file. Luckily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video#Flash_Video_Structure">all FLV files</a>
that contain video start with the byte sequence <code>FLV\x01\x05</code>. So let’s search our 2 TB disk for
that byte sequence and print out the byte offset of all occurences!</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/md2 \
	| pv -s 1888127576000 \
	| grep -P --byte-offset --text 'FLV\x01\x05' \
	| tee -a /mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This took roughly 7 hours. The <code>pv</code> command with the (rough) total size of the disk is optional, but gives you
a nice progress bar. Overall, this took a little over 6 hours on our server.</p>

<p><code>grep</code> works line-based, which in a binary file menas “any byte sequence between two ASCII line breaks”. The
log file therefore contained lots of lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>184473878409:&lt;some binary data&gt;FLV&lt;some binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In total, the search found 126 FLV file headers on our disk. This was pretty reassuring, since we had 122 FLV files
still known to the file system – so there are at least four FLV byte sequences without a filename!</p>

<pre><code># find /mnt/disk/var/recordings/ -name '*.flv' -not -empty -ls | wc -l
122
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I needed to find out which of the 126 byte sequences did not have a filename. Since I really didn’t want
to spend all weekend with a deep-dive into the ext4 disk layout, I went for an easier solution: For every file
still known in the file system, I computed a hash of the first 500 kilobytes of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>#!/usr/bin/python3

    <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>known_hashes</span><span>),</span> <span>"hashes"</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Interestingly, two files from the completely different customers shared the same hash of the first 500 kilobytes.
I haven’t tested it yet, but my theory is that those were streams that just did not contain any audio or video
in their first minutes, but only empty frames. However, since I knew this isn’t the case for my missing file,
I felt confident in proceeding with this approach.</p>

<p>Next, I computed the same hash for every byte offest found by grep and compared it to the hashes found in the
previous step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>grep_log</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt'</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at scale. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"DynamoDB can manage upward of 10 trillion requests daily and can support thresholds of more than 20 million requests per second" - AWS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having been using it for while, in this article, I'm going to summarize essential knowledge about Amazon DynamoDB that helps you: <em>Quickly understand and know its use cases</em> -&gt; <em>Get started using it</em> -&gt; <em>Know what to consider for best utilization</em>.</p>
<p>It's a 15-minute read, but after reading it, you'll know how DynamoDB works, when you should use it, and how to best utilize it when it's necessary.</p>
<hr>

<p>First of all, it's Amazon DynamoDB, not AWS DynamoDB. <em>(People understand it either way, it's respectful to call a thing correctly though)</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-dynamodb">What is DynamoDB?</h2>
<p>Basically, DynamoDB is a database where you write and read your application data. Application data is the core information of your application like user profiles, user activities, transactions, etc. These data change very frequently and grow enormously large as your application grows. Using a database like DynamoDB, you don't need to work with physical disks, you simply ask the database to write and read data for you, it will make sure things work correctly under the hood.</p>
<p>Technically, DynamoDB is a <strong>fully-managed</strong>, <strong>NoSQL</strong>, <strong>key-value</strong> and <strong>document-based</strong> database.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fully-managed</strong>: AWS <em>fully manages</em> it for you. DynamoDB scales seamlessly, you don't maintain any server. AWS takes full responsibility for running, managing servers, software updates, backing up, cluster scaling, and all other ops. You use it by calling its APIs, just like how you'd use Stripe.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>NoSQL</strong>, <strong>key-value</strong>: DynamoDB has neither relationship nor schema, which means that you don't have to define what columns or fields an entry of data has. DynamoDB consists of <em>tables</em>. Each table consists of <em>items</em>. Each item has <em>a uniquely identifiable key</em> and <em>other non-constraint attributes</em>. Each attribute is a <em>pair of key and value</em>. A key is a string. A value can be null, string, number, boolean, binary, list, or nested object. Except for the unique key, items can have different attributes from each other.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>"Table X"</span>: [
  {
     <span>"key"</span>: <span>"unique-key-1"</span>,
     <span>"a"</span>: <span>"some-value"</span>,
     <span>"b"</span>: <span>1</span>
  },
  {
     <span>"key"</span>: <span>"unique-key-2"</span>,
     <span>"c"</span>: <span>false</span>,
     <span>"d"</span>: {
        <span>"it"</span>: <span>"can have nested JSON"</span>,
        <span>"too"</span>: <span>null</span>
     }
  },

  
]

<span>"Table Y"</span>: [  
  
]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document-based</strong>: Each entry of data in DynamoDB is a JSON document, a.k.a. JSON object. Every operation happens at the document level, which means that an operation is either a document is retrieved, or a document is created, or a document is replaced, or a document is deleted. There's no operation at attribute level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pricing-model">Pricing model</h2>
<p>DynamoDB offers 2 pricing models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pay per request</strong>: you pay for the number of writes and reads you requested. DynamoDB automatically scales to accommodate traffic from your application. It costs <em>$1.25 per million write</em> request units and <em>$0.25 per million read</em> request units (in Ohio region). This model is a good choice if you can't predict how much traffic your application will receive and don't prioritize cost optimization yet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Provisioned</strong>: you specify and pay for a specified number of read units and write units <em>per hour</em>. DynamoDB will be always ready to handle traffic at the provisioned capacity, regardless of how much traffic your application is actually receiving. This helps you set a predictable cost and performance for your application. It's useful when you've already known the pattern. You can change provisioned units every 24 hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, when your application is growing steadily, you can buy <em>reserved units</em>, which can save over half the price if you pay upfront for a year.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>DynamoDB works best when you're searching for simplicity and scalability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of its serverless trait, DynamoDB helps you have (theoretically) infinitely scalable database infrastructure from day one with zero ops overhead in the future. When your application data grow to terabytes or petabytes, your database infrastructure stays the same, you simply provision and buy more capacity. This can be an advantage to keep your technical team lean.</p>
<p>However, DynamoDB query ability is quite limited compared to most other database services, which makes it difficult and inefficient to query complex models and relationships.</p>
<p>In my experience, DynamoDB is a great choice for microservices, where each service has 2-4 models, and their relationships can be detached and implemented in a NoSQL design.</p>
<p>Netflix uses DynamoDB to build its A/B testing service that serves 125+ million users, while FanFight reported saving 50% of cost and achieving 4x revenue by migrating to DynamoDB.</p>
<hr>

<p>Now, let's explore some essential concepts to get started using it.</p>
<h2 id="partitions">Partitions</h2>
<p>DynamoDB slices your table up into smaller chunks of data called <em>partitions</em>, in order to speed up reads.</p>
<p>Each table must have a partition key, which DynamoDB uses to decide which partition to put an item into.</p>
<p>A partition is also logical isolation of a DynamoDB query. A DynamoDB query can only query data in a partition. If you need to query data in 2 different partitions, you'll need 2 queries or a full table scan.</p>
<h2 id="primary-key">Primary key</h2>
<p>A primary key is a way to uniquely identify an item in a table, it is the only attribute that you'll need to define before creating a DynamoDB table and starting to use it.</p>
<p>There're 2 types of a primary key in DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Single primary key</strong>: the partition key - a single and always-unique attribute, which is usually an ID, e.g. user ID, post ID, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Composite primary key</strong>: the partition key and a sort key. The first key is used for partitioning, the second key is used to sort items in the same partition. The combined value of these two keys has to be unique across a table.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-types-of-read">5 types of read</h2>
<p>In DynamoDB, there are 5 types of a read operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>GetItem</code>: read a single item by specifying its primary key.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>BatchGetItems</code>: send a request that groups up to 100 <code>GetItem</code> requests together. Each request is executed separately and in parallel. It is possible that some reads succeed whereas others fail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TransactGetItems</code>: all-or-nothing <code>BatchGetItems</code>. All operations must either succeed or fail together. This costs twice as much as <code>BatchGetItems</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Query</code>: read multiple items in the same partition. You must specify the partition key, and optionally a filter condition on the sort key.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Scan</code>: read <strong>all items</strong> in a table.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="read-consistency">Read consistency</h2>
<p>DynamoDB has 2 types of read consistency, which can be useful for different applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eventually read consistency</strong>: you get your data the fastest, but not always the latest. You'll usually receive the data 1 second ago.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strongly read consistency</strong>: you always get the latest data, but the latency may be higher and the reading cost is double.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="secondary-indexes">Secondary indexes</h2>
<p>Every read operation except for a <code>Scan</code> must start with the partition key, to query on other attributes without scanning through the whole table, you'll need another tool - a secondary index.</p>
<p>A secondary index is essentially an (automatic) copy of a table but has a different partition key and sort key so that you can query on these different keys.</p>
<p>There're two types of a secondary index in DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Global secondary index</strong>: is a complete copy of a table, has its own partition key and (optionally) a sort key. A partition key in a global secondary index doesn't have to be unique. Global secondary index only supports eventually consistent read.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Local secondary index</strong>: is a local copy of a partition sorted by another key. A local secondary index shares the same partition key as the base table but has a different sort key. Local secondary index supports both strongly and eventually consistent read.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After creating an index, you do all read operations on it as if you do on the base table.</p>
<p>Creating a secondary index will cost you more for data storage and write operations. DynamoDB automatically updates the indexes when you update the base table and it will charge for all these updates as typical write operations.</p>
<h2 id="3-types-of-write">3 types of write</h2>
<p>In DynamoDB, there are 3 types of a write operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>PutItem</code>, <code>UpdateItem</code>, and <code>DeleteItem</code>: create, update and delete a single item by specifying its primary key.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>BatchWriteItems</code>: send a request that groups up to 25 <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> requests together. Each request is executed separately and in parallel. It is possible that some writes succeed whereas others fail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TransactWriteItems</code>: all-or-nothing <code>BatchWriteItems</code>. All operations must either succeed or fail together. This costs twice as much as <code>BatchWriteItems</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>


<p>Related models mean that these models have a direct relationship to each other. For example, a post belongs to a user, a post has multiple comments, a user can comment on multiple posts.</p>
<p>When your app has more than 3 related models, it's highly a chance that SQL is a better choice because you have out-of-the-box extremely complex query features in SQL. Modeling relationships in SQL is much simpler. On the contrary, trying to model relationships in NoSQL is like trying to workaround its disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-break-my-app-into-smaller-apps">Can I break my app into smaller apps?</h3>
<p>DynamoDB is best for microservices when your app is a combination of multiple smaller apps.</p>
<p>Let's take the posts-comments-users example, can you break it into smaller apps? The answer is yes, you can make it 3 smaller apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>User directory app</em>: stores user profiles, credentials, etc, and authenticates users.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Blogging app</em>: stores and renders posts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Commenting app</em>: stores and shows comments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DynamoDB is the perfect database for these smaller apps because they have very simple and discrete data.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip #1</strong>: There's a high possibility that there're external services implemented for one of your smaller apps, e.g. Firebase for authentication, Disqus for commenting.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip #2</strong>: Because of this, DynamoDB is a great choice if you want to build micro-SaaS, which is on-trend in the current market 🤯.</p>
<h3 id="1-write-40-reads">1 write = 40 reads</h3>
<p>Use this to decide whether you should …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>We all know that programming languages can be incredibly useful tools. However, what if there were languages that were not created to be used? Ones that test the boundaries of programming language design and cause even the most experienced programmers to bang their heads against the wall trying to build a simple program? Enter esoteric programming languages.</p><h2>What Are Esoteric Programming Languages?</h2><p>Most programming languages are designed for the purpose of widespread use and productivity. However, Esoteric programming languages (esolang) are a segment of programming languages that are not built for usability, but rather for entertainment, artistic intent, or to prove a concept. The word “esoteric” is <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/esoteric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derived from the Greek word “esoterikos”</a>, which means “belonging to an inner circle”. Esoteric languages are not intended to be widely understood.</p><h2>The Purpose of Esoteric Languages</h2><p>The first-ever esoteric programming language was <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/intercal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTERCAL</a>. A parody created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Woods_(programmer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Woods</a> and James M. Lyon in 1972 that mimicked popular languages at the time, such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/">COBOL.</a> The idea was later revived in 1993 when Wouter van Oortmerssen designed <a href="http://strlen.com/false-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FALSE</a>. The concept was to build a powerful, tiny implementation (compiler executable of 1024 bytes) programming language with an obfuscated syntax that was disorienting to its users. From here, more recognizable names such as <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainfuck</a> and <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Befunge</a> began to emerge and the concept of esoteric languages began to take shape as a concept.</p><p>As previously stated, esoteric languages have four main purposes. To act as a proof of concept, for competitive sport, display an artistic process and simply for entertainment. To better grasp these ideas, let’s look into each of them with an example language.</p><h3>Proof of Concept (Brainfuck)</h3><p>The first purpose of esoteric languages we are going to look at is proof of concept. A language that was able to present a proof of concept to the computer science community was <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainfuck.</a> A minimalist programming language that contains an astonishing eight characters in total while still proving to be <a href="https://medium.com/@evinsellin/what-exactly-is-turing-completeness-a08cc36b26e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing-complete</a>. The language should not be used for practical projects due to its complexity at scale (as the name suggests). However, it is interesting to see that a programming language can have its utilities with such a small amount of primitives. Here is an example of the language:</p><h3>Competitive (Malbolge)</h3><p>Esoteric languages can also be viewed in a competitive context, such as Malbolge. Languages like Malbolge were created with the sole intent to be exceptionally incomprehensible and difficult to use. Achieved through self-modification, non-intuitive operators and encryption, Malbolge is one of the hardest programming languages to learn. It also very well could be the first of its kind for this purpose in mind. The competition revolving around Malbolge is contained within the premise of the language. That anyone able to make a useful program with Malbolge deserves bragging rights. Here’s a sample of how difficult the language is to use.</p><h3>Artistic (Shakespeare)</h3><p>The third purpose of esolang’s are for artistic purposes. A popular example of this is the <a href="http://shakespearelang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakespeare language</a>. A unique programming language that is meant to resemble the writing from Shakespearean plays. The language is unique, as it redefines the entire programming paradigm. Instead of focusing on producing an intended result, the goal is to make the code itself look more elegant. If only all our code looked as clean as this!</p><h3>Entertainment (COW)</h3><p>Finally, some esoteric programming languages are simply meant to be entertaining.&nbsp; Such as the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COW language by Sean Heber</a>. As a derivative of the Brainfuck language mentioned above, COW only has 12 primitive. All of which are different capitalizations of the word ‘moo’. It’s hard to imagine why someone would go through so much effort to create this language. In a way, this comical language really does grasp what programming is all about: incredibly frustrating, a little silly and most importantly, fun.</p><h2>The Interesting Thing About Esoteric Languages</h2><p>So that’s pretty much all you need to know about esoteric programming languages. In a strange way, they are like the ‘conceptual art’ of the programming world. Unconventional and weird, but often thought-provoking and fascinating. Esoteric languages break the recycled formula that most conventional languages follow. Making me believe that these languages could one day be the key to new applications of programming.</p><p>Although, if nothing else, they are fascinating designs to look at. Which remain untouched over years, without the over looming necessity to stay ‘current’ like the majority of popular languages today. Allowing them to only become more interesting with age.</p><p>You can check out a full list of esoteric programming languages, <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> If you have anything to add, I would love to hear it in the comment section below!</p><p>If you are a programmer that is interested in making passive income, <a href="https://thecodebytes.com/make-passive-income-programming-5-incomes-for-software-developers/">check out this</a>.</p><p>Most of the insights I gathered from this post were from <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">esolangs.org</a> and <a href="https://morr.cc/esolangs/esolangs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esoteric Programming Languages by Sebastian Morr</a>.</p><p>Happy coding everyone!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <amp-auto-ads type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1298191191396779" i-amphtml-layout="container"></amp-auto-ads><p><a href="https://cornucopia.cornubot.se/2020/10/september-2020-den-minst-dodliga.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2020 was the least deadly month in Swedish history</a>, in terms of number of deaths per 100,000 population. Ever. And I don’t mean the least deadly September, I mean the least deadly month. Ever. To me, this is pretty clear evidence of two things. First, that covid is not a very deadly disease. And second, that Sweden has herd immunity.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sebrushworth/status/1319222055343185921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When I posted this information on my twitter feed</a>, the response from proponents of further lockdown was that the reason September was such an un-deadly month, was because everyone has already died earlier in the pandemic. To me, that seems like a pretty self-defeating argument. Why?</p><p>Because 6,000 people have died of covid in Sweden, a country with a population of 10,000,000 people. 6,000 people is 0,06% of the population. If it is enough for that tiny a fraction of a population to die of a pandemic for the pandemic to peter out so completely that a country can have its least deadly month ever, then the pandemic was never that deadly to begin with.</p><p>In August, <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/08/04/how-bad-is-covid-really-a-swedish-doctors-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote an article where I proposed that the mortality for covid is only 0,12%</a>, roughly the same as influenza. That number was based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation. I figured that, since the death rate had dropped continuously for months and was at very low levels, Sweden must have reached a point where it had herd immunity. And I figured that at least 50% of the population must have been infected for herd immunity to have been reached. 50% of Sweden’s population is five million people. 6,000 / 5,000,000 = 0,12%</p><p>At the beginning of October, one of the World Health Organisation’s executive directors, Mike Ryan, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that the WHO estimated that 750 million people had so far been infected with covid</a>. At that point, one million people had died of the disease. That gives a death rate for covid of 0,13% . So the WHO said that the death rate is 0,13% . Not too far off my earlier back-of-envelope estimation. This of course begs the question why there are continued lockdowns for a disease that is no worse than the flu.</p><p>A short while later, the <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO released an analysis by professor John Ioannidis</a>, with his estimate of the covid death rate. This analysis was based on seroprevalance data, i.e. data on how many people were shown to have antibodies to covid in their bloodstream at different times in different countries, which was correlated with the number of deaths in those countries. Through this analysis, professor Ioannidis reached the conclusion that covid has an overall mortality rate of around 0,23% (in other words, one in 434 infected people die of the disease). For people under the age of seventy, the mortality rate was estimated at 0,05% (in other words, one in 2,000 infected people under the age of 70 die of the disease).</p><p><a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/28/herd-immunity-without-antibodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I’ve discussed before, I don’t think antibody data gives a very complete picture</a>, since there are studies showing that a lot of people don’t produce measurable antibodies in their bloodstreams, but still have immunity, either thanks to a T-cell response, or thanks to local antibody production in the respiratory tract. So I think that the fatality rate is significantly lower than what the analysis by professory Ioannidis found, and more in line with what the WHO stated earlier in October.</p><p>But even if the antibody based number is the correct number, then covid still is not a very deadly disease. For comparison, the 1918 flu pandemic is thought to have had an infection fatality rate of 2,5%, i.e. one in forty infected people died. So the 1918 flu was 11 times more deadly than covid if you go by professor Ioannidis antibody based numbers, and 19 times more deadly than covid if you go by the fatality rate provided 12 days earlier by the WHO’s Mike Ryan.</p><p>And this is missing one big point about covid. The average person who dies from covid is over 80 years old and has multiple underlying health conditions. In other words, their life expectancy is very short. The average person who died in the 1918 pandemic was in their late 20’s. So each death in the 1918 pandemic actually meant around 50 years more of life lost per person than each death in the covid pandemic. Multiply that by the fact that it had a 19 times higher death rate, and the 1918 flu was in fact 950 times more deadly than covid, in terms its capacity to shorten people’s lives.</p><p>Ok, I’ve discussed the fatality rate of the 1918 flu pandemic, and compared that to covid. But what about the fatality rate of the common cold viruses that are constantly circulating in society? How does covid compare to them?</p><p>Many people think that the common cold viruses are harmless. But in fact, among elderly people with underlying health conditions, they are frequently deadly. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343795/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A study carried out in 2017</a> found that, among frail elderly people, rhinovirus is actually more deadly than regular influenza. In that study, the 30 day mortality for frail elderly people admitted to hospital due to a rhinovirus infection was 10% . For frail elderly people admitted to hospital due to influenza, 30 day mortality was 7% .</p><p>What is my point?  If you are old and frail, and have underlying health conditions, then even that most harmless of all infections, the so called “common cold”, can be deadly. In fact, it often is. Covid-19 is not a unique disease, and does not appear to have a noticeably higher mortality rate than the so called “common cold”.</p><p>There is one final aspect to all this that needs to be discussed. And that is the effect of covid on overall mortality. If it turns out that covid has no effect on overall mortality, then that really brings in to question why we are locking down, since we’re not actually preventing any deaths. So, what is the effect of covid on overall mortality?</p><p>Let’s look at Sweden, since that is perhaps the country that has taken the most relaxed approach of any to preventing spread, and which should therefore also reasonably be expected to have had the highest impact on its overall death rate. From January to September 2020, <a href="https://cornucopia.cornubot.se/2020/10/september-2020-least-deadly-month-ever.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweden experienced 687 deaths per 100,000 population</a>. The last time Sweden had a deadlier year was 2015. Personally, I don’t remember any big deadly pandemic happening in 2015.</p><p>In fact, 2020 is so far one of the least deadly years in Swedish history, and is largely in line with the average for the preceding five years. To be precise, it is 2,7% higher than the average for the preceding five years, which is well within the margin of error. In 2019, mortality was 6% lower than the average, so it should be expected that 2020 would have a slightly higher mortality than average, even without covid.</p><p>What does this mean? It means that covid, a supposedly deadly viral pandemic, has not killed enough Swedes to have any noticeable impact on overall mortality.</p><p>How can this be explained, when we know that 6,000 Swedes have died of covid?</p><p>As I see it, there are two possible explanations. The first is that most people who died “of” covid actually died with covid. In other words, they had a positive covid test and were therefore characterized as covid deaths, when the actual cause of death was something else. The second is that most people who died of covid were so old, and so frail, and had so many underlying health conditions, that even without covid, they would have died by now. There are no other reasonable explanations.</p><p>I am not saying that covid is nothing, or that it doesn’t exist. I am saying that it is a virus with a marginal effect on longevity. And yet, public policy in most countries has been driven by doomsday scenarios based on completely unrealistic numbers.  To put it simply, we’ve acted like we’re dealing with a global ebola outbreak, when covid is much more like the common cold.</p><p>UPDATE (26th October 2020): After SCB updated their numbers it has become clear that September 2020 was in fact the second least deadly month in Swedish history, not the least deadly month. That award goes to June 2019.</p><p>You might also enjoy reading my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/19/covid-19-does-sweden-have-herd-immunity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about why I think Sweden has herd immunity</a>, or enjoy watching <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/10/13/covid-podcast-with-ivor-cummins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my conversation with Ivor Cummins of Fat Emperor about covid-19</a>.</p><section id="blog_subscription-17"></section><div><div><p> I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden.

        <blockquote>
<p>Why do I receive so many spams?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this question was asked by my girlfriend (now wife ðŸ˜…), my immediate answer was “Stop giving away your email” and I suggested creating a secondary email for “suspicious” websites. Also, using the same email everywhere is like leaving the same <strong>footprint</strong> on the Internet, allowing advertisers to <code>cross-reference</code> your online behavior.</p>



<p>
    <img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/footprint.jpeg" alt="Fingerprint image">
</p>


<p>She followed the advice, created a second email and was happy at first. But now she doesn’t even check this mailbox as there are so many spams in it ðŸ’�ðŸ�»â€�â™€ï¸�.</p>

<p>So creating a second email is not a true solution. She needs more than 2, maybe hundreds. <strong>And why not an email for each website</strong>? But she cannot go to Gmail or Outlook to create hundreds of accounts, this is unmanageable. There must be a better way.</p>

<p>The solution is <code>email alias</code>. An alias is a normal email address but all emails sent to an alias will be <strong>forwarded</strong> to your real email address. Alias acts therefore as a <strong>shield</strong> (or a proxy) for your real email address. An alias can be disabled anytime, making the spams stop.</p>

<p>Nowadays, some websites allow to unsubscribe quickly but a lot of them still make unsubscribing a difficult process. Some wouldn’t even honor the request. And this doesn’t stop the websites from cross-referencing your data with your email being the common key.</p>

<p>Let’s make spammers’ life harder with email alias!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Isetta Engine is a student-driven project about demystifying game engine development and providing a roadmap and relevant knowledge for novice developers. To do so, <a href="https://isetta.io/team/">our team</a> will make a game engine by ourselves starting from a collection of base frameworks, and document the process, pitfalls, and advice for our audience with periodic blogs. Besides that, we will conduct interviews with experienced professionals to augment our novice perspective. We believe the novice perspective from our blogs and expert perspective from the interviews will nicely come together and form a complete document to help people get started. </p>
<p>The reason we think more work needs to be done in this field is that too many game engine developers wait until the completion of the engine, typically years, to talk about their development. For studios, this is because they consider the final product to be the game, not the engine. For others, it may be because the engine is what they see as valuable, not the writing. As a result, these talks typically lose the minutiae of the actual daily struggles that took place in the development process. There are others who document their development which has been going on for years, which makes it a daunting task for newcomers to start following along. </p>
<p>Although the project is aimed at helping novice developers, this is not to be used as a sole source of learning engine development. Being new engine developers ourselves, we can't guarantee the way we develop the engine will be correct, which is why interviews will help the project remain grounded. This means others who are learning can use what we've done as a guide and not necessarily the ground truth. The blogs won't be a walkthrough/tutorial/step-by-step instructions on how to develop an engine. We are learning as we go and think our journey is what can be valuable to you. </p>
<h3 id="about-the-project">About the Project<a href="#about-the-project" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This project is being done as a student-pitched project at the <a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu/">Entertainment Technology Center</a> (ETC). The ETC is an interdisciplinary Master's degree program at Carnegie Mellon University where students' main focus is working on small teams on a project each semester during a 3-month time period. Throughout the semester, a team's work will be presented to faculty and peers with feedback and critique being presented to help aid in the project development. Our particular project idea has gone through multiple iterations to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplify the engine to be feasible within 3 months and</li>
<li>Deliver content that would be useful, and hopefully enjoyable, to consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of writing this, we've learned that creating content that will satisfy both is difficult and time-consuming, so we will be focusing on writing these milestone-type blogs as well as posting various types of content to test which is the best form of presenting our work. The short project duration also forces us to think clearly about our scope and be lean on the features we include before starting. </p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule<a href="#schedule" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the course of this project <strong>(08/26 - 12/16, 2018</strong>), a blog post will be published every week to share our thoughts and process, and an interview will be published every 1-2 weeks. The interview schedule depends on our progress on the engine itself, as each interview's topic will be themed around our current work.</p>
<p>For latest schedule, see our <a href="https://isetta.io/schedule/">schedule</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="#prerequisites" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although we will cover some basic features of engine development, it will profoundly help if you have experience in C++ programming and developing software, especially games, as our project won't provide step-by-step instructions on how to do everything. For a list of resources on how to gain related knowledge, please go to the <a href="#Readings">Readings</a> section. Additional resources will be posted on our <a href="https://isetta.io/resources/">resource page</a>.</p>
<p>Another prerequisite is passion for learning game engine development. As you are still reading this, we assume you are as excited about this as we are. This will be a bumpy ride, but you will have us on your side.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research<a href="#research" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Being a student-pitched ETC project means that the project needed to pass through a pitch process of consulting and convincing faculty in the program. This allowed us to receive feedback about what could be considered a reasonable/manageable scope and where we might hit challenges for a general project. For this project to be a valid ETC project as well as accomplish our mission statement, there needs to be a fine balance between documentation and development. </p>
<p>Before confronting the big monster of engine development and documentation, we thought it would be a good idea to gear up by getting input from people who have actually done this. During our pitch process, we reached out and got the chance to talk to numerous industry professionals and got extremely helpful advice from them. All of these suggestions helped us shape our project into what it is now and provided invaluable knowledge on how to start a game engine. Thus we encourage you, too, to approach professionals and get advice if possible. We've compiled our notes from our conversations with them into a write-up, which will be published soon.</p>
<h3 id="why-another-engine">Why another engine?<a href="#why-another-engine" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using an existing game engine like <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal</a> or <a href="https://www.panda3d.org/">Panda3D</a> is always a handy option to make a game. These well-established engines have a strong collection of tools and APIs so that developers can focus on making the game, not the wheels. However, there is the limitation of not having full control over all systems in the engine as well as not knowing how the engine is processing the game logic and assets. These can obstruct the complex systems of an engine, so although you may have an understanding of how a physics or graphics engine works, each engine operates differently and optimizes for different constraints. </p>
<p>In terms of learning about game engines and how to develop one, these established engines aren't a good source. Panda3D, originally developed by Disney and expanded by past ETC projects, has an older codebase in 2018 with limited community involvement. It is also not using the current industry standard language (C++). Unity and Unreal are both too massive and too cutting-edge to be suitable engine learning material for novices. In addition, Unity's source code isn't publicly available so you technically can't learn from it. The huge codebase sets a high threshold for any beginner to get started.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap<a href="#roadmap" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Isetta Engine will support the most primitive form of networked multiplayer twin-stick shooter game. Networked multiplayer was selected to be a part of the engine because it offers significant design and development challenge on every level of the project, and will help differentiate this engine from others being developed. We decided to create the engine in 3D for two reasons: Most AAA engines are 3D, and 3D requires more math and problem solving for us as developers to learn and grow from.</p>
<p>While planning, and before we knew too much about game engines, we had a basic idea of what a game engine would consist of. The image below displays the second/third iteration of what the Isetta engine would look like. We were initially naive thinking we may be able to do both networking as well as physics, however quickly came to grips that would balloon the scope too much. The audio and graphics were and are still planned to be imported from external libraries, and more of the discussion of what is imported and why will be included in a future blog. This diagram of the engine will soon be replaced with more in-depth explanations.</p>
<p><img alt="alt_text" src="https://isetta.io/images/blogs/week-0/pitch_architecture.png" title="Engine Architecture During Pitch"></p>
<h3 id="genre">Genre<a href="#genre" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As for our choice of the twin-stick shooter genre, we came to the decision after lengthy consideration of the components required to build other game types as well as how that genre would utilize multiplayer. Twin-stick shooters can effectively have little to no physics, which is different from collisions (this will be explained in <a href="https://isetta.io/blogs/week-1/">week 1 blog</a>). Likewise, the information passed between networked sessions is relatively minimal and not too strict on latency. What's more, a twin-stick shooter specializes in simplistic gameplay that doesn't need a world editor or too much design. </p>
<p>In a Skype meeting, <a href="https://waltdestler.com/">Walt Destler</a> explained to us that each game -and more particularly, each genre- requires vastly different netcode solutions. This is also one of the reasons why we prefer netcode over physics, as it can greatly narrow down the genre options. For example, multiplayer shooters, specifically PvP shooters, require small amounts of information to be passed (i.e. bullet and player locations) from server to client with relatively low latency. PvP shooters can also feature client-side prediction <sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as well as the additional requirement of lobby/matchmaking with usually more than 2 players. On the other hand, genres like turn-based strategy require large amounts of information to be passed (all units, decisions, resources, etc.) to all users without too much concern for latency or prediction.</p>

<p>The other piece of advice we frequently heard from professionals and our faculty alike was the benefit of developing a game in conjunction with the engine. Doing so, they explained, allows you to prove and demonstrate your engine works as expected. The game can also test features to show immediate edge cases of the engine. </p>
<p>Another nicety of developing an engine is that feature creep can be prevented when you keep expanding certain features that won't be utilized in the final product. What the game built from this engine <em>won't</em> be is something original or necessarily fun. However, that's not to say a fun, original game couldn't be created from this engine. The idea of our sample game is to intentionally be derivative so features of a basic twin-stick shooter will be already included in the engine, rather than only specific …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>







<p>This article discusses some issues in typography, especially those related to the dash and quotation marks.</p>

<p>I've had some interest in typography since early 1990s of the Mac's Desktop publishing era. Basically, i avidly read books about fontography in libraries or Mac magazines such as MacUser and Macworld, and played with fonts and math typesetting in software such as Microsoft World and Mathematica, including reading Knuth's book on typography and using his TeX system, reading about font technology such as TrueType . So, i am generally acquainted with the concepts and issues of typography, though never worked in any professional area related to it.</p>

<p>I'll have to say, the entire typographical efforts and establishment is rather largely a waste of time, similar in the sense that some “artistic” circles chalk up photography as high art, or that grammarians and pedants have voluminous and vociferous writing style guides and guilds.</p>

<p>Some of the most fartful things the typography-sensitive crowd discuss
or distinguish are: hyphen, en-dash, em-dash,
ligature, kerning, font “design”.
</p>

<p>In general, the function of typography is mainly about issues in printing with respect to the facilitation of reading. So, the major issues involved are: line length, line spacing, serif and sans serif fonts, margin, font sizes, and these pretty much are about it. But since how things are rendered on paper does create differences in the sense of esthetics, sometimes rather pronounced difference, thus typography does indeed have some esthetical elements. However, this is blown out of proportion to stupendous profundity.</p>

<h2>Hyphen and Dash</h2>

<p>Look at these guilded morons go:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Traditionally an em dash—like so—or spaced em dash — like so — has been used for a dash in running text. The Elements of Typographic Style recommends the more concise spaced en dash – like so – and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash “belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography”. The spaced en dash is also the house style for certain major publishers (Penguin, Cambridge University Press, and Routledge among them). However, some longstanding typographical guides such as The Chicago Manual of Style still recommend unspaced em dashes for this purpose. The Oxford Guide to Style (2002, section 5.10.10) acknowledges that …</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The above is from Wikipedia <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash">Dash</a>.</p>

<p>Here's my own rule regarding the use of dash: There are 2 kinds: the short dash and the long dash.</p>

<p>For the short one, press the “-” key on your keyboard. For the long one — as a punctuation mark for embedded thought — press it twice. That's it. Simple and functional. And, always include a space around them. (personally, in my writings published on my site, i replace the double dash by a em-dash “—” only because it is prettier, but don't consider it important)</p>

<p>The character “-” you type on your keyboard is the
ASCII 45. (ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
[see <a href="http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_character_representation.html">ASCII Table</a>]
 The character is named “hyphen” in the ASCII standard, but is called “hyphen-minus” by <a href="http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_index.html">Unicode</a>. (because Unicode has now proper symbols for hyphen, figure-dash, en-dash, em-dash, (math) minus, and quite a few others. Each differ slightly in position, thickness, length.)</p>

<ul>
<li><mark title="U+2D: HYPHEN-MINUS">-</mark> HYPHEN-MINUS</li>
<li><mark title="U+2014: EM DASH">—</mark> EM DASH</li>
<li><mark title="U+2013: EN DASH">–</mark> EN DASH</li>
<li><mark title="U+2012: FIGURE DASH">‒</mark> FIGURE DASH</li>
<li><mark title="U+2212: MINUS SIGN">−</mark> MINUS SIGN</li>
</ul>

<p>As to the typographer's senses and sensibilities about how figure-dash
should be used for numbers and en-dash is used for ranges and em-dash is
for punctuation and hyphen is for word-breaking … etc, i regard them pretty
much all as trifles produced by morons whose brain is inadequate to sense
or tackle the depth of logic and mathematics of languages and structures
but fell into a niche of diddling and went on to procure their efforts
to heighten themselfs among human animals.</p>

<h3>Hypen and Narrow Columns</h3>

<p>For hyphen, as in “breaking a word for words near the margin”, my general advice is to abolish such practice. But what to do in a narrow column of text? My general advice is to abolish the practice of layout using very narrow columns.</p>

<h3>Justification</h3>

<p>
A related concept here is Typographical Justification. My general advice here is to abolish the practice of justification entirely. (leave it jagged at one end; actually as esthetically superior. (and factually functionally superior with regards to reading-facilitation))
</p>

<h4>Ligature</h4>

<p>The typographic conventions of ligatures (as in adjoining certain letter combinations such as “fi” as a single glyph <mark title="U+FB01: LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI">ﬁ</mark>) should also be abolished.</p>

<h2>Quotation Marks</h2>

<p>Related here is the quotation mark. If you read Wikipedia on
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table" data-accessed="2020-11-14">Quotation mark#Summary table</a>
, you'll see that there are huge variations. Here's the characters used for quotation.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>glyph</th><th>Unicode name</th><th>common name</th></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</td><td>Curly double quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+2018: LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK">‘</mark> <mark title="U+2019: RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK">’</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</td><td>curly single quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+AB: LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">«</mark> <mark title="U+BB: RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">»</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION</td><td>French double quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+2039: SINGLE LEFT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">‹</mark> <mark title="U+203A: SINGLE RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">›</mark></td><td>SINGLE LEFT/RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+300E: LEFT WHITE CORNER BRACKET">『</mark> <mark title="U+300F: RIGHT WHITE CORNER BRACKET">』</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT WHITE CORNER BRACKET</td><td>Chinese double quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+300C: LEFT CORNER BRACKET">「</mark> <mark title="U+300D: RIGHT CORNER BRACKET">」</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT CORNER BRACKET</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+300A: LEFT DOUBLE ANGLE BRACKET">《</mark> <mark title="U+300B: RIGHT DOUBLE ANGLE BRACKET">》</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT DOUBLE ANGLE BRACKET</td><td>Chinese title bracket</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+3008: LEFT ANGLE BRACKET">〈</mark> <mark title="U+3009: RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET">〉</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+3016: LEFT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET">〖</mark> <mark title="U+3017: RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET">〗</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET</td><td>Chinese brackets</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+3010: LEFT BLACK LENTICULAR BRACKET">【</mark> <mark title="U+3011: RIGHT BLACK LENTICULAR BRACKET">】</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT BLACK LENTICULAR BRACKET</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201F: DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK">‟</mark></td><td>DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201E: DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">„</mark></td><td>DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201A: SINGLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">‚</mark></td><td>SINGLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK</td><td>◇</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Here's a list of conventions of using the double curly quotes:</p>

<ul>
<li><mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> … <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> UK, USA, Canada, Irish, …</li>
<li><mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> … <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> Swedish, Finnish, …</li>
<li><mark title="U+201E: DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">„</mark> … <mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> German, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Icelandic, Lithuanian, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Sorbian, …</li>
<li><mark title="U+201E: DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">„</mark> … <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> Dutch, Polish, Hungarian, …</li>
</ul>

<p>Ain't it bizarre?</p>

<p>For some languages, such as Chinese, it is rational how it
developed into using symbols (e.g. 『』「」《》〈〉【】〖〗) that are
different from European languages's curly quotation marks. However,
among European langs, there are extreme diversity in using the curly
quotation marks. Even the American and English reverse the purpose of
the single and double quotes. Some lang reverses the semantics of the
left/right pair, some lang positions the mark at the bottom instead of
top, some place them in opposite corners (as opposed to both on top),
some lang use the same symbol for both the opening and closing
marker.</p>

<p>One thing interesting about the curly double quotation mark pair is that the two symbols are not bilateral symmetric, but is rotational symmetric. That is, if you rotate the left one 180 degrees, you get the right one. Most other matching pair symbols ()[]{} are bilaterally symmetric (i.e. there is a horizontal line of mirror reflection, and the left/right symbols are vertical mirror reflection of each other.). The fact that the curly quotes have only rotational symmetry, must have contributed significantly the weird diversity in their role as the choice in the opening/closing mark and whether to position them level on a line or at opposite corners. (Note that the Chinese corner brackets 『』「」 also lack a bilateral symmetry, however, their box-corner shape intuitively and uniquely define their placements.)</p>

<h3>Combinatorial Possibilities</h3>

<p>This glyph <mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> (U+201C) points upper-right. This glyph can be mirrored in a vertical line or horizontal line to create the matching variation, a total of 4 possibilities (think of p q b d).</p>

<p>Here are the different pointing curly quotes from Unicode: <mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> <mark title="U+201F: DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK">‟</mark>.</p>

<p>In Unicode, i couldn't find one that is pointing to upper-left. This is
somewhat curious. (If you look at the Wikipedia article on quotation
conventions, you see that actually no language use such a char.)
</p>

<p>I created one with
image here just for the illustration:
<img src="http://wordyenglish.com/musing/i/double_curly_quote_upleft.png" alt="double curly quote upleft.png"></p>

<p>The quotation mark can be placed on the upper line of the text (as in USA convention) or lower line (as in the beginning quotation mark in German convention), a total of 2 possibilities.</p>

<p>So, 4 choices of glyph orientation, 2 possible positions, that's 8 possibilities for the opening quote. Same for the closing quote. So, the total number of styles to use the quotation punctuation with double curly quote is 8×8=64.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that this hasn't been exploited.</p>

<h3>How it should be</h3>

<p>The function of quotation marks is to demarcate text, and as such delimiters, it should be a matching pair such as ( ) [ ] { }, and the pair should have no more than a bilateral symmetry to reflect the natural one-dimensional left/right flow of written text (or, up/down in Asian langs).</p>

<p>If we can rewrite convention, i'd say we all just use simple left/right pairs such as ()[]{}. Since these already have a purpose, then we could use ‹›«»〈〉《》【】〖〗. The French quotation marks « » ‹ › is actually the most sensible here among western langs. (though, other countries using French quotation mark also reverse direction or use the same glyph for both opening and ending. This is idiocy gone berserk.)</p>

<p>But since we cannot restart history nor do we want to break convention radically because we'd create confusion, what i do today personally of writings published on my website, is to use the most ubiquitous convention, the American convention “like this”. (I experimented in using the French convention of «like this», but that turns out to be too in-your-face for English readers)</p>

<h2>Problem of Non-matching Straight Quotation Marks</h2>

<p>It is unfortunate, thru the historical development of the typewriter and the computer keyboard and ASCII, that our keyboard doesn't have the proper matching curly quotes, but instead, has the straight quotes. Here's the symbols and their Unicode name:</p>

<!-- " -->

<ul>
<li>QUOTATION MARK (ASCII 34; U+0022):<mark title="U+22: QUOTATION MARK">"</mark> (double straight quote)</li>
<li>APOSTROPHE (ASCII 39; U+0027):<mark title="U+27: APOSTROPHE">'</mark> (single straight quote)</li>
<li>GRAVE ACCENT (ASCII 96; U+0060):<mark title="U+60: GRAVE ACCENT">`</mark> (backtick)</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates a problem because it forces us to use the same symbol
for a purpose that naturally calls for a matching pair. Using a
single symbol is harder to read. Further, it causes global damage when
one is missing (e.g. caused by typo or transmission error).</p>

<p>It would've been better, if the typewriter was designed with a matching single curly quote. That is, …</p></div></div>

<p>Coincidentally enough, I had decided that I wanted to write a letter to my mentor Tony this weekend, thanking him for the huge impact he’s had on my life. But I suppose that has now morphed into a more public letter. </p>



<p>Being in a zombie, half blurry-eyed state, it’s a little tough to articulate well what Tony has meant to me. We go through life, and a lot of people have an impact on us, and it’s often hard to say that a particular person caused you to take a particular path. But, Tony is one of the few people whom I can definitely say my life would not at all be what it is without him. </p>



<p>I first met him many years ago in Dec 1996 when I was just starting high school. My best friend Jennifer asked me what I was doing for winter break and if I wanted to help out her cousin Tony with his new internet startup. I had no idea what an internet startup was, but I had nothing going on, so I agreed to go. </p>



<p>On the first day of our holiday break, Jennifer and I hopped on the Caltrain from the peninsula (Silicon Valley) to head to his office in SOMA (San Francisco). It was exciting! We couldn’t drive, but we could go to a startup office all by ourselves! I followed Jennifer to the address. I think their office was actually someone’s apartment. And when we got there, there seemingly was no one there. We hung around for a while, and maybe about 10am or so some people started to trickle in – this was my introduction to startup life. </p>



<p>Tony had more or less just graduated from Harvard, as he had spent a few short months at Oracle after graduation, and then decided to quit to build his own company LinkExchange. Leaving a big employer so quickly was highly unusual back then, and he would go on to do many non-conforming things that he was right about. </p>



<p>LinkExchange was an ad network. If you had a website and hosted LinkExchange ad banners, for every 2 impressions you generated, you received 1 free impression of your banner. Back then because the internet was still new, people paid attention to banners and clicked on them like crazy, so this was incredibly effective in helping generate traffic for people. LinkExchange would then sell the remaining ad impressions. They had launched the service earlier that year, and by that December, they were already growing like crazy. </p>



<p>I definitely was *not helpful*. We put together some tables and chairs. And made ethernet cables from scratch. Yes, from scratch. We had to cut cables, splice the individual wires, and insert them into plastic tips and crimp them. I was terrible at this, and Jennifer largely fixed all of my mistakes (as always). Since I was so bad at the ethernet cable making process, they asked me to help them put together an internal webpage to keep all their meetings / schedule together. Great! I could put my basic HTML skills to use. I don’t think they liked the amateurish turquoise background that I chose, so someone at LinkExchange quickly fixed it. </p>



<p>I was more of a nuisance than help, but what I saw that day was super inspiring. Here were a bunch of friends who were getting together to build things. They could wear whatever they wanted, saunter in whenever they wanted, and eat all the pizza they wanted. And they all had varied tasks and were taking business meetings in what looked like a kitchen? There was never a dull moment. It was the dream. Neither of my parents worked in tech and certainly not startups, so this was incredibly eye-opening, and immediately, I knew that this was what I was going to do when I grew up – become an entrepreneur and start companies. Without this exposure to startups in 1996, I don’t think I would have made this realization (if at all) for many years.</p>



<p>Fast forward a few years later. Microsoft bought LinkExchange just 2 years later for a reported $265m. Tony and his college friend Alfred (who also was at LinkExchange) decided to start a startup incubator with their own money. (As a side note, the food at their restaurant in this incubator was fantastic!) This was bold and unique, because Idealab was really the only one doing something somewhat similar at the time. The concept of accelerators or incubators would not come in a big way until years later. </p>



<p>I don’t think Tony knew this, but while in high school, I cold-emailed almost every single one of his portfolio companies to ask them for an internship. I was determined to work at a startup as soon as possible in high school and start my startup career. I ended up working at one of his portfolio companies (probably unbeknownst to him) in the summer of 2000 which really help set me on my path to a career in startups. Often that first opportunity is the hardest to land, and each subsequent opportunity opens more and more doors.</p>



<p>By late 2000, the stock market had crashed and everyone was fleeing startups. Newspapers ran headlines saying that tech was dead and that all programming jobs would be outsourced. They couldn’t have been more wrong, but most people panicked and stopped investing in startups. Tony, was always a first-principles thinker, and he leaned into this and ended up co-leading one of his portfolio companies Zappos. As an e-commerce company that provided free shipping and free returns, Zappos’ margins were razor thin. This scared most VCs. (This would certainly scare me.) But, he believed that it could work if customers had a great experience and would become repeat customers. So, he poured a lot of his own capital into the business when no VC at the time would touch this company. While many VCs pontificate about high level things, he looked at problems from a bottom’s up approach which made his thinking often unique from others. </p>



<p>In order to make the Zappos model work, he needed customer service to be top notch, reliable, and have a lower cost. It was clear to him that this model wouldn’t work in pricey San Francisco. So, he made another bold decision to move the company to Henderson, NV, which could provide all of those things. This was at a time when certainly most people believed you can only build an internet business in the San Francisco Bay Area. In hindsight, when they ended up needing to hire tons of people, being the BEST internet company in the Las Vegas area allowed them to swoop up talent that would have been a huge war to win in San Francisco.  The other thing that was apparent to me, is that the Zappos family was incredibly diverse — and free to be themselves. Tony’s attention to culture and cultivating an open and welcoming work family left a lasting impact on me, and he started doing this well before it became a trend. Like so many of you, his book <em>Delivering Happiness</em> has affected my own thinking.</p>



<p>Fast forward many years, Jennifer and I were working on our own startup, and we were grappling with a particular challenge. We decided to consult Tony and get his advice. In a very Tony-like way, he basically told us to do what we thought was best. I remember feeling frustrated at the time, because…I didn’t know what was best! I had wanted him to tell me what he thought was best! But a good mentor helps you find your own answer – he/she doesn’t tell you the answer.  </p>



<p>In that meeting, he also pulled out a book and told me to read it. The book was <em>Start with Why</em> by Simon Sinek. So I read it. The gist of the book is that to build a great company, you need to go back to first principles. Most people start building a company by trying to sell their product details. “Buy my shoes! They are grey with stripes.” But customers, employees, and everyone want to rally around something much bigger — something inspirational that the company stands for. It actually took me many years to process this and actually figure out how to implement this — I didn’t get this right for LaunchBit, but after marinating on this advice for years, this is what we’ve been striving to do at Hustle Fund. We aren’t just capital deployers. We are trying to create a movement and a philosophy. That particular meeting with Tony is one that I play in my head over and over – I feel like I finally understand what he was getting at and that is what I most wanted to tell him this weekend. </p>



<p>If cynics believe that it’s impossible to get ahead in life without being an asshole, Tony Hsieh is a good example of someone who defies the norm. He was never flashy and always kind and generous to all. I could go on and on in writing this, but thank you, Tony, for helping me in so many ways that you may not have been aware. For your kindness, generosity, and inspiration.</p>



<p>Sending big hugs to the entire Hsieh family whom I consider to be my second family and who took me in during my formative years and had a huge impact on who I am today.</p>

	<time datetime="2020-11-28">November 28, 2020</time>
  
	<p>Growl is being retired after surviving for 17 years. With the announcement of Apple’s new hardware platform, a general shift of developers to Apple’s notification system, and a lack of obvious ways to improve Growl beyond what it is and has been, we’re announcing the retirement of Growl as of today.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming. Growl is the project I worked on for the longest period of my open source career. However at WWDC in 2012 everyone on the team saw the writing on the wall. This was my only WWDC. This is the WWDC where Notification Center was announced. Ironically Growl was called Global Notifications Center, before I renamed it to Growl because I thought the name was too geeky. There’s even a sourceforge project for Global Notifications Center still out there if you want to go find it.</p>

<p>We’ve had a lot of support over the years; from our hosting providers at <a href="http://www.networkredux.com/">Network Redux</a>, <a href="http://www.cachefly.com/">CacheFly</a> and others, to all of the apps using our framework, bindings, or any other integration. Special thanks go to <a href="https://adium.im/">Adium</a> and <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>. Without these two projects having developers who wanted different types notifications, Growl wouldn’t have existed. Without Growl I do not know that we would have any sort of decent notification system in OS X, iOS, Android or who knows what else. </p>

<p>Special thanks goes to <a href="https://www.transifex.com/">Transifex</a> who made localizing into 24 languages a lot easier than anything else we tried. It’s a fantastic product, if you make software please try it. Our localizers were fantastic people and should all be commended for their work. </p>

<p>For developers we recommend transitioning away from Growl at this point. The apps themselves are gone from the app store, however the code itself still lives. Everything from our rake build system to our code is available for use on our <a href="https://github.com/growl/growl/">GitHub page</a></p>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>B-tree</td>
<td>B<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/rum.png" width="50%">

</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>

Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)

<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

But I know that writing consistently will keep me on a path to starting something down the line and will increase my chances of success.</p><p>Starting a startup is a huge leap, but writing can be a smooth onramp.</p><p>Why is that the case?</p><h3><strong>Developing the intellectual honesty to navigate product-market fit</strong></h3><p>The most simple answer to “how do I build a startup?” is to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html">make something people want</a>. As a writer, you’re trying to create a piece of content that readers want. Aren’t they basically the same thing?</p><p>As I’m typing this, I’m trying to make a piece of content that people want – that answers some of the big questions aspiring founders have around how to position themselves to start a startup in the future.</p><p>One of the most important skills that founders can have is the ability to be intellectually honest with themselves about their ideas and if people actually want what they’re building. Founders who are able to be skeptical of their own ideas and challenge their own assumptions find product-market fit faster (AKA building something people want).</p><p>Writing something that your target audience wants to read requires a similar level of self-awareness and self-scrutiny. For example, as I was sitting down to write this, I almost wrote a post about how writing a book accelerated my career. But as I thought about the target readers of this newsletter and what they wanted, I realized that while that post may have been good, it ultimately does not address some of the biggest questions my ideal readers have.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, if you’re able to figure out how to write things that people want to read, you’ll have a lot of the skills required to build something that people want.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Getting comfortable with shipping early and often</strong></h3><blockquote><p><em>“If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late”</em> - Reid Hoffman</p></blockquote><p>Building a startup requires that you ship products uncomfortably early and open yourself up to scrutiny. Founders who are comfortable doing this ship early and often, allowing them to get feedback from the market and keep improving towards making something that people want (and that works).&nbsp;</p><p>Consistently publishing writing requires that you get comfortable with shipping uncomfortably early the possibility that something you ship might not be great, or that an opinion you have might be wrong. As I’m writing this article, I think it’s going to be good! But I know that there’s a distinct possibility that it might not be as good as I hope. Writing a newsletter means I need to ship it regardless rather than spending weeks agonizing about making it perfect. In the future, based on feedback I get, I can always crystallize some of the concepts in this post in other ways. Writing this newsletter is a forcing function, getting me back into the mentality of shipping early and often.</p><p>Getting comfortable with shipping writing to readers will help you be more comfortable with shipping other things (like products) to customers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Building a relevant network of mentors, peers, and audience</strong></h3><p>Starting a startup involves many chicken-and-egg challenges and leaps of faith. Founders need to attract early adopters for products that are barely working. They need to attract investors, co-founders, and early employees for ideas that are incredibly risky.</p><p>When starting from zero, looking ahead to some of these challenges is incredibly daunting. Even as a former founder myself with a pretty good network, when I look ahead into the possibility of starting another startup down the road, I wonder if I’ll be able to do it again.</p><p>One way to make these down-the-road challenges easier is by building a relevant network of mentors, peers, and who share your interests in something. If you’re able to do that, then you’ll have a network of investors, teammates, and early customers/users who are interested in whatever you build down the road and will give you their attention.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ajt">Alex Taub</a>’s story is a great example. <a href="https://alexstechthoughts.com/">Alex’s Tech Thoughts</a> (which he started in 2010) included blog posts on Business Development, tech startups that he liked, and other various tech-related topics. Not many of his posts went viral and Alex didn’t necessarily become a prolific tech writer, but his writing made him a magnet for people in tech who were looking to level up their careers. I came across Alex as a college senior looking to break into startups in 2012 and started following his writing and engaging with him on Twitter. There are many people like me who first engaged with Alex through his articles or tweets.</p><p>A year ago, he started working on a new startup, <a href="https://upstreamapp.com/">Upstream</a>, a new social professional network. Kickstarting a social professional network is a huge challenge. But because of Alex’s writing, he had an audience of similarly-minded ambitious tech folks who followed him. This gave him a huge advantage in starting a social professional network, and he’s been able to quickly overcome some of the early chicken-and-egg problems that have killed countless social professional networks before Upstream.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I don’t know what startup I’m going to start down the line. But part of my motivation for writing is that it will help me start to find the areas I’m most interested in, help me meet people with similar interests who could be future collaborators, and build an audience of people who care about the topics I’m writing about. Today, writing is one of the best things I can do to de-risk my future startup, whatever and whenever that is.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Developing clarity of thought and unique points of view</strong></h3><p>One of the biggest things investors look for in early stage investments is if the founders have a unique insight about what they’re building. If founders have a unique insight on the product or market, then perhaps they can be successful where others have failed. When I think about what I need in order to start my next startup, one of my prerequisites is a unique, contrarian insight that would enable me to build something unique and different. How do develop unique insights? One way is by writing.&nbsp;</p><p>Before sitting down to write this, I had some loose thoughts around how writing is generally a good thing for aspiring founders to do. But through the process of writing this, I’ve developed clarity and conviction that writing is an ideal onramp to starting a startup. It started as an idea, and through writing this post, that idea turned into a non-obvious insight that is now one of my firmly held beliefs.</p><p>Writing –&nbsp;especially long form writing and not just tweets –&nbsp;forces you to have clarity of thought and form strong, supported points of view.&nbsp;These points of view can turn into the theses behind future startups.</p><h3><strong>Establishing credibility and expertise</strong></h3><p>Establishing credibility on a topic results in people trusting you as an expert. When you’re a trusted expert, people are more willing to give you their attention, time, or ideas.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/">Ryan Hoover</a> founded <a href="https://producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>, a site to discover or launch new products. But what did Ryan do before Product Hunt?&nbsp;</p><p>He wrote <a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/todays-behaviors-tomorrows-startups">essays about building habit-forming products</a>, <a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/what-philz-coffee-can-teach-us-about-product-design">product design</a>, and breakdowns of <a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/easter-egg-marketing-how-snapchat-apple-and-google-hook-you">some of the most popular products like Snapchat</a>. All this culminated in Ryan writing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788">a book with Nir Eyal about habit-forming products</a>.</p><p>By the time that Ryan was tinkering around with the idea for Product Hunt, he already had credibility as a product expert through his writing, and he was the perfect person to launch an idea like Product Hunt. When Ryan reached out to his friend Nathan Baschez about the idea, <a href="https://medium.com/lets-make-things/the-origin-of-product-hunt-7acb09e2593a">Nathan was happy to spend some time building the MVP</a>. When Ryan debuted Product Hunt as an email list, people who knew Ryan were eager to sign up. When new people who didn’t know Ryan saw that a guy who’d written essays and a book about products was launching something called Product Hunt, it seemed like real deal. Ryan’s credibility as a product expert helped him get Product Hunt off the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>But what if you don’t have expertise? Write.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2018 after I wound down my startup, I by no means considered myself an expert on seed stage fundraising –&nbsp;I’d only raised $1M in funding and hadn’t raised from top-tier VCs. But I ended up writing a guide to fundraising in a Google Doc which I shared with some friends. That Google Doc started getting longer and longer, and I looped in my friend <a href="http://maxnuss.com/">Max</a> as a co-author to turn the growing Google Doc <a href="https://oversubscribed.club/">into a book</a>. I developed expertise on fundraising through the process of writing the book and writing a newsletter about fundraising.&nbsp;The fact that I wrote a book and a bunch of essays about fundraising has given me credibility as a fundraising “expert.”</p><p>Expertise isn’t a prerequisite for writing about a topic –&nbsp;it’s the result.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly, that’s part of why I’m writing this newsletter. I want to write my way into becoming an expert on entrepreneurial careers.</p><h3><strong>Writing is a more accessible onramp that preserves optionality</strong></h3><p>Not everyone can quit their job and go full-time on side projects that they want to turn into startups. Not everyone can spend 10-15 hours per week working on a side project. But everyone can carve out a few hours per week to write if they prioritize it.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, this newsletter for me is a more minimal version of a side project I was working on a few months ago: a non-profit which helped founders move on from their startups and figure out the next chapter of their entrepreneurial careers. After working on it for a few …</p></div></div>

<p>KHipster is a development platform to generate, develop and deploy Spring Boot + Angular/React/Vue Fullstack Web applications and Spring microservices. KHipster is built on top of JHipster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, we will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate microservices with KHipster using JHipster Description Language (JDL)</li>
<li>Generate Kubernetes configuration using JDL</li>
<li>Generate code using KHipster</li>
<li>Create a Kubernetes cluster in GCP</li>
<li>Install Linkerd CLI and deploy Linkerd in Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Deploy ingress controller in Kubernetes</li>
<li>Deploy applications in Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Configure traffic to application</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us get started.</p>
<h2 id="generate-microservices-with-khipster">Generate Microservices with KHipster</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-install-khipster">Step 1: Install KHipster</h3>
<p>KHipster is available as an NPM package. To install it run:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ npm i -g generator-jhipster-kotlin
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not have Node installed? Check out <code>nvm</code> (Node Version Manager) that makes it easy to setup Node - <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, verify the installation by running:</p>

<h3 id="step-2-create-jdl-file">Step 2: Create JDL file</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The JDL is a JHipster-specific domain language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JDL provides a DSL to describe the applications, deployments, entities and their relationships. <code>Applications</code> refer to the service as a whole, the application can be a monolith or microservice. The <code>deployments</code> refer to the way to deploy the application it can be <code>kubernetes</code>. The <code>entities</code> straightaway maps to the database table in your application. The <code>relationships</code> refers to the entity relationship <code>one-to-one</code>, <code>one-to-many</code>, etc.,. JDL simplifies the process of creating the microservices applications and entities.</p>
<div><pre><code>// Gateway application
application {
    config {
        applicationType         gateway
        authenticationType      jwt
        baseName                gateway
        buildTool               gradle
        clientFramework         react
        databaseType            sql
        devDatabaseType         h2Disk
        prodDatabaseType        mysql
        packageName             com.sendilkumarn
        serverPort              8080
        serviceDiscoveryType    no
    }
    entities *
} 

// Microservice application
application {
    config {
        applicationType         microservice
        authenticationType      jwt
        baseName                service
        buildTool               gradle
        databaseType            sql
        devDatabaseType         h2Disk
        prodDatabaseType        mysql
        packageName             com.sendilkumarn
        serverPort              8081
        serviceDiscoveryType    no
    }
    entities product
}

// Product entity 
entity product  {
    name    String  required
    price   Long    required
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>We have defined 2 applications: <code>gateway</code> and <code>service</code>, and an entity: <code>product</code>. The major difference between <code>gateway</code> and <code>service</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gateway</code> uses <code>clientFramework</code> as <code>react</code>, <code>applicationType</code> as <code>gateway</code></li>
<li><code>service</code> uses <code>applicationType</code> as <code>microservice</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Refer we have used <code>serviceDiscoveryType no</code>, this implies that we are not using serviceDiscovery in the microservices. We will use Linkerd for servicediscovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know? JHipster supports <code>sql</code> and <code>noSql</code> database and it has many configuration options for generating the applications. Check the entire list of application configuration options <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications#available-application-configuration-options" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="generate-kubernetes-configuration">Generate Kubernetes configuration</h2>
<p>KHipster provides <code>kubernetes</code> option to generate the Kubernetes configuration file for the <code>JHipster</code> generated applications. Interested to explore more about Kubernetes check out <a href="https://sendilkumarn.com/blog/kubernetes-for-everyone" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. The <code>jdl</code> accepts <code>deployment</code> block to define the Kubernetes deployment.</p>
<div><pre><code>deployment {
  deploymentType         kubernetes
  appsFolders            [gateway, service]
  dockerRepositoryName   "sendilkumarn"
  serviceDiscoveryType   no
  istio                  false
  kubernetesNamespace    khipster
  kubernetesServiceType  Ingress
}
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: It checks whether you have installed Docker since we need Docker for creating and pushing the images and use them later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kubernetes definition is made inside the <code>deployment</code> block with <code>deploymentType</code> as <code>kubernetes</code>. The <code>appsFolders</code> points to the folders of the generated applications. We define the <code>dockerRepositoryName</code>, this refers to docker user name here. Similar to applications, we define the <code>serviceDiscoveryType</code> as <code>no</code> (since we are going to use <code>Linkerd</code> for service discovery). KHipster provides <code>istio</code> out of the box, since we are going to use <code>Linkerd</code> for that. We define the Kubernetes namespace using <code>kubernetesNamespace</code> property. All the deployments &amp; services use <code>khipster</code> namespace to deploy the application.</p>
<p>Finally, We use <code>Ingress</code> as the <code>KubernetesServiceType</code> configuration. The smallest deployment unit of Kubernetes is a <code>pod</code>. A pod is a group of Docker containers. Refer here for more information about the <a href="https://sendilkumarn.com/blog/kubernetes-pods" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pods</a>. Each pod gets IP address during its creation. If we have to access the application we have to connect to the pod's IP address (with port if applicable). In the Kubernetes cluster, pods are created and destroyed automatically based on various factors. So when a pod spawns newly, IP address referring them might change.In order to connect to running applications in the pods, we use services. Services define a set of pods and a way to access them. The services is like a loadbalancer or service discoverer that helps to identify the pods with a name to it.</p>
<p>Kubernetes provide three types of service type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster IP  - This exposes service to an cluster internal IP</li>
<li>Nodeport  - This exposes the service to an port</li>
<li>Load Balancer - This exposes the service to an external IP</li>
</ul>
<p>With <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kube-DNS</a>, Kubernetes also maps the service to an external name. Refer <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for more infomration.</p>
<p>Ingress is not a service type, but with Ingress you can expose the service. The ingress acts as an entry point for your cluster. It is ideal for exposing multiple services under the same IP address.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need <code>ingress-controller</code> to expose services via ingress IP, we will set up ingress-controller below.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="generate-code-using-khipster">Generate code using KHipster</h2>
<p>The <code>khipster import-jdl</code> imports the <code>JDL</code> file and generates the application and the deployment configuration files.</p>
<div><pre><code>λ khipster import-jdl app.jdl

Gateway application generated successfully.
Service application generated successfully.
Kubernetes configuration generated successfully.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Login the docker using <code>docker login</code>. Now go and build each services in their respective folders:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-username&gt;:&lt;app-name&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="create-a-kubernetes-cluster-in-gcp">Create a Kubernetes cluster in GCP</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Install gcloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code>λ gcloud beta container --project &lt;project-name&gt; clusters create "khipster-cluster" --machine-type "c2-standard-4" --num-nodes "2" --zone "us-central1-c"
</code></pre></div>
<p>We create a cluster named <code>khipster-cluster</code> in the given project. We define the <code>machine-type</code> with <code>c2-standard-4</code> with 2 nodes in the <code>us-central1-c</code> zone. This will take a while to complete, since it has to create a cluster from the scratch.</p>

<h2 id="install-linkerd-cli-and-deploy-linkerd-in-kubernetes-cluster">Install Linkerd CLI and deploy Linkerd in Kubernetes cluster</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Linkerd is a <code>service mesh</code> for Kubernetes. Linkerd makes running services easier and safer by giving you runtime debugging, observability, reliability, and security—all without requiring any changes to your code. - <a href="https://linkerd.io/2/overview/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Linkerd website</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install the CLI manually in your system and set up the path, run:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ curl -sL https://run.linkerd.io/install | sh
Linkerd stable-2.9.0 was successfully installed 🎉

λ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.linkerd2/bin
</code></pre></div>
<p>Check the installation by running:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ linkerd version
Client version: stable-2.9.0
Server version: unavailable
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the installation is completed. Before installing the Linkerd in the Kubernetes cluster, we wil check whether the Kubernetes cluster is configured correctly. We run:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ linkerd check --pre
....
Status check results are √
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The above command checks whether the kubernetes cluster is configured correctly and ready to install the Linkerd control plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: The bare Kubernetes configuration might not have the required cluster admin role. To create the <code>clusterrolebinding</code> with <code>cluster-admin</code> role for the selected account.</p>
<div><pre><code>λ kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"

clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-admin-binding created
</code></pre></div>
<p>To install the Linkerd on the Kubernetes cluster, run the following:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ linkerd install | kubectl apply -f -
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>linkerd install</code> command creates the kubernetes configuration files. We pipe the configuration files using <code>kubectl apply -f </code> command on those generated files. This will create the complete <code>linkerd</code> in the kubernetes cluster. Once the installation is complete refer the installation is complete using</p>

<h2 id="deploy-ingress-controller-in-kubernetes">Deploy ingress controller in Kubernetes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ingress exposes <code>HTTP</code> and <code>HTTPS</code> routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ingress provides an external IP with which we connect to the services running inside the Kubernetes cluster. The Ingress also provides load balancing, SSL / TLS, and others. We will install a vanilla version Nginx ingress controller:</p>

<p>Once the ingress-controller is installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Get the IP address by running the following command:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ kubectl get svc ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
</code></pre></div>
<p>Our application will be accessible via the above IP address.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-applications-in-kubernetes-cluster">Deploy applications in Kubernetes cluster</h2>
<p>To deploy applications in to the Kubernetes cluster, go into the Kubernetes folder and run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ ./kubectl-apply.sh apply -f
</code></pre></div>
<p>All the deployments and services will be installed in the K8s cluster. Now we need to auto inject Linkerd into the <code>khipster</code> namespace for all the services in that particular namespace.</p>
<p>Next, let's add Linkerd to <code>khipster</code> namespace by running:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ kubectl get -n khipster deploy -o yaml \
  | linkerd inject - \
  | …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>The 2020 election results are riddled with irregularities and suspect problems. Below is a sampling of the issues. I’ll continued to update this list and likely add additional states as time permits. </p>

<p><strong>Arizona</strong><br>A sampling of 2,044 voters by Voter Integrity Project showed <strong>44 percent did not request an absentee ballot</strong>, even though they reportedly received one. Arizona law prohibits sending a ballot to a voter who has not requested one. The project also showed nearly 6,000 people voted in 2020 election who no longer met the state’s residency requirements. Moreover, the sampling revealed 157 people who voted twice. </p>

<p><strong>Georgia</strong><br>An analysis by Voter Integrity Project (VIP) shows <strong>more than 20,000 people voted in Georgia who did not meet the state’s residency requirements to vote</strong>. Biden’s margin of victory in Georgia is 12,670 votes. <a href="http://youtu.be/XH9ihoLi1NA">youtu.be/XH9ihoLi1NA</a> This one piece of data could flip the Peach State into Trump’s favor. VIP also showed 395 people voted twice over 1,200 used a post office as their home address, even though this is prohibited by state law. </p>

<p>Even though substantially more people voted by mail this year in Georgia, the state’s current mail-in<strong> ballot rejection rate</strong> is running extremely low at about 0.24%. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxnvet9e">https://tinyurl.com/yxnvet9e</a> The historical average is 3%. Why is the rejection rate, a figure that could flip the state to Trump, running so low?</p>



<p>Trump was leading Biden on election night in Georgia, but early in the morning on November 4, Fulton County (Atlanta) stopped counting. Election officials claimed a <strong>pipe burst</strong> at the State Farm Arena where ballots were being counted. But a subsequent open records request located no records or work orders relating to water main break at or near the arena. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5cj2585">https://tinyurl.com/y5cj2585</a></p>



<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong><br>According to state senator Doug Mastriano, the Pennsylvania Department of State posted the official results as showing that 1,823,148 ballots were mailed, of which 1,462,303 were returned. But the “grand total” of mail-in votes counted showed to be 2,589,242. That’s a difference of over one million votes between the number of mail-in ballots that showed to have been returned verses the number of mail-in ballots the state says it counted. The posting of this mass discrepancy in the numbers has since been deleted by election officials without explanation.&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6ckzfop">https://tinyurl.com/y6ckzfop</a></p>



<p>During the Pennsylvania legislative hearing, an expert computer scientist witness stated that state is missing 47 memory cards. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6fg9xjn">https://tinyurl.com/y6fg9xjn</a> Another expert witness stated that in one 90 minute peroid, Joe Biden received about 570,000 votes whereas Trump received a mere 3,200 votes, which is statically improbable. Watch the video here: </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Voter Integrity Project identified 1,400 people listed a post office as their home address in Pennsylvania, which is illegal. These people went one step further and used “Apt., “Suite,” “Unit,” etc. to conceal the true address.</p>



<p><strong>Michigan</strong><br>According to an affidavit filed in <em>King v. Whitmer</em>, numerous precincts and townships reported substantially more ballots were cast than registered voters.</p>



<p>Wayne County reported 70% of Detroit’s&nbsp;<strong>134 absentee counting boards were out of balance by one&nbsp;to more than four&nbsp;votes without explanation</strong>. In other words, more votes were cast in these precincts than the number of people signed into vote.&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4m94ost">https://tinyurl.com/y4m94ost</a></p>



<p>According to data scientist Sarah Eaglesfield, the <strong>largest cluster of votes in Wayne County Michigan came from a psychiatric hospital</strong> for patients with severe mental illnesses.<strong> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5j4rngq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/y5j4rngq</a></strong></p>



<p>A small random sample of 163 in the deceased voter dataset showed there two ballots were cast on behalf of dead individuals. Although the report of votes being submitted for deceased voters en masse cannot be substantiated, further work is needed to conclude exactly how many people voted on behalf of the deceased. There are<br>also instances of votes on behalf of deceased people being received, but rejected. Who is voting for the dead in Michigan? <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxulbhfq">https://tinyurl.com/yxulbhfq</a> </p>

<p>A lot has happened in 2020. As this strange and unsettling year comes to a close, I wanted to look forward to some of the trends that are likely to define the coming decade.</p>
<p>I’m going to cover a lot of ground in this article, so if you’d like to hop around, I’ve divided these trends into five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#technology">Technology</a></li>
<li><a href="#business">Business</a></li>
<li><a href="#education">Education</a></li>
<li><a href="#finance">Finance</a></li>
<li><a href="#society">Society</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sure you’ll disagree with me on some points, so I’d love to hear why. Feel free to pass me a message via <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4d2625382a25283e6320280d2a202c2421632e2220">email</a>.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is only when they go wrong that machines remind you how powerful they are.” - Clive James</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="artificial-pseudointelligence">Artificial (Pseudo)Intelligence</h3>
<p>Sadly, the term “Artificial Intelligence” has been co-opted by marketers to mean nothing, but that doesn’t mean that advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence will not impact the next decade. The continued advancement of AI will produce the greatest impact on human productivity since the industrial revolution, but I don’t think it will necessitate mass unemployment the way that alarmists do.</p>
<p>The common fear around AI is that robots will come in and take all of our jobs. Maybe someday, but truly sentient AI isn’t coming this decade. All existing AIs use pseudo-intelligence to ingest massive amounts of data and extract patterns from it based on programmed parameters. This makes <a href="https://disruptiveviews.com/ai-good-things-terrible-others/">AI <em>much</em> better at some tasks</a> than humans and <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/">comically much worse at others</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xY5HMi3.png" alt="Strengths of AI vs. strengths of humans"></p>
<p>AI will excel by partnering with humans. For example, GPT-3 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/09/08/the-guardians-gpt-3-generated-article-is-everything-wrong-with-ai-media-hype/">is not going to write great blog posts on its own</a>, but it could be used to help a human writer create better or more content faster. I recorded a <a href="https://youtu.be/lywWkR0vo_A">video of how I could see this working recently</a>:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lywWkR0vo_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><strong>This pattern of human-AI partnerships will be the defining technological advancement of the 2020s.</strong> Machines will help us <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-gpt3.html">write code</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@intelligent_pathways/business-process-automation-with-artificial-intelligence-4828356488b7">automate business processes</a>, <a href="https://aiartists.org/">create art</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/artificial-intelligence-to-reduce-medical-errors-d87bdb8e1ce5">reduce medical errors</a>, <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3400877/artificial-intelligence-in-sports-a-smarter-path-to-victory.html">perform better in sports</a>, and much more. It’s going to take time for us to figure out how best to partner with our computer allies in these ventures, but I’m really excited to see what people come up with.</p>
<h3 id="no-code-and-low-code">“No-Code” and “Low-Code”</h3>
<p>Low-cost access to higher-level abstractions in the form of open-source frameworks, languages, and libraries have completely changed software development. Software developers are <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/plumbing">the plumbers of the 21st century</a>: it takes some skill to learn all the tools, but you don’t need to forge your own pipes to install a toilet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/what-no-code-movement-means-for-software-developers">No-code is just the next higher-level abstraction for writing software</a>, and it’s going to allow <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-software-now-everybodys-job-the-implications-of-low-code-and-no-code-for-developers/">millions of “non-developers” to build custom software</a>. While it won’t supplant the need for specialized applications at large businesses, it will <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/creating-a-tech-startup-without-a-developer">remove the requirement for new startups and small businesses to have a technical founder</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more, no-code is being embedded in the next generation’s casual play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take the popularity of platforms like Roblox and Minecraft. Easily derided as just a generation’s obsession with gaming, both platforms teach kids how to build entire worlds using their devices. Even better, as kids push the frontiers of the toolsets offered by these games, they are inspired to build their own tools. There has been a proliferation of guides and online communities to teach kids how to build their own games and plugins for these platforms (Lua has never been so popular).” - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/the-no-code-generation-is-arriving/">Danny Crichton, TechCrunch</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2020s will be the decade where kids raised playing Minecraft join the workforce. They’ll bring a casual acceptance that everyone can create custom business tools, and the millennials who think working knowledge of Excel is enough will get left in the dust.</p>
<h3 id="computing-on-the-edge">Computing on “the Edge”</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, as more devices have become “smart,” people have been trying to figure out what we could do with all these small internet-connected devices. The 2020s will be the decade where the first killer features hit this network of edge computing devices.</p>
<p>As a software developer, one of the most exciting advancements is the possibility of hosting more of our applications on the edge. Today, this means using specialized hosting services like <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/">Netlify</a>, or <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> to serve APIs or web applications at globally distributed data centers. In the not-so-distant future, it might mean serving our applications from a peer-to-peer network that uses available compute power in nearby smart devices or phones.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rlPTvJd.png" alt="Peer to peer hosting"></p>
<p>Even if peer-to-peer is unrealistic this decade, edge computing will continue to find new uses. For example, TinyML enables smart devices to share the computing responsibility for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/11/03/how-tinyml-makes-artificial-intelligence-ubiquitous/">creating and processing machine learning models</a>. In the coming decade, your cell phone, computer, refrigerator, thermostat, and lights could be networked such that they “understand” your habits and alert you to unusual behaviors without sending this data to a central server.</p>
<p>The smart home is fun to think about as a consumer but probably not as important as smart manufacturing or smart resource extraction. The 2020s will bring a proliferation of companies like <a href="https://www.uptake.com/">Uptake</a> in a variety of industries which process and understand the myriad inputs coming in from networked devices around the worksite (or the world).</p>
<h2 id="business">Business</h2>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="default-to-remote-work">Default to Remote Work</h3>
<p>While many in-person events will come back after the Covid-19 pandemic is under control, companies were forced to rethink the requirement that all employees go into an office every day. Some of the world’s biggest companies <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/">are extending remote options</a> and will likely downsize their office footprints in the coming decade. Startups that want to have the whole company together will likely move to hybrid models as well.</p>
<p>Remote work for white-collar office workers like programmers, accountants, and designers makes sense, but Covid-19 has pushed everyone to consider a default-remote future. Teachers have had to learn how to work remotely, convenience store workers are <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8748519/Robot-stocking-shelves-Japanese-convenience-store-lets-workers-maintain-social-distancing.html">controlling robots remotely in Japan</a>, and personal trainers are <a href="https://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/86898.html">adapting with virtual offerings</a>. Some of these in-person roles will return, and some will not.</p>
<p>As more workers get the option to work from home, this will affect other aspects of society as well. Why pay 3x per square foot in a city center if you don’t have to go to the office every day? Why buy a car if you only drive twice a week? If you want some sense of community, why not join a neighborhood coworking space instead of going to a downtown office?</p>
<p>Remote workers will re-evaluate these norms in the coming decade.</p>
<h3 id="automation-of-last-mile-transportation">Automation of Last Mile Transportation</h3>
<p>For years, we’ve heard about autonomous vehicles, but in the past year as <a href="https://azdot.gov/motor-vehicles/professional-services/autonomous-vehicles-testing-and-operating-state-arizona">a few pilot programs have taken to city streets</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx">states have figured out how to legislate them</a>, it’s looking like the self-driving car will finally arrive this decade. One area that especially excites me about autonomous vehicles is <a href="https://www.sharedmobility.news/how-driverless-delivery-vehicles-are-solving-the-last-mile-delivery-problem/">last-mile delivery</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, getting packages and mail to the final recipient is expensive, especially in rural areas. If the trend toward remote work pushes middle-class professionals back into the suburbs and exurbs, there’s going to be an increased demand in fast shipping to these distant areas, so we’ll see Amazon and other carriers continue to invest in driverless technology.</p>
<p>With any luck, the US Post Office will actually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/21/725524334/u-s-postal-service-is-testing-self-driving-trucks">catch this trend and stay relevant</a>, but if not, I’d bet they’ll be shut down or reorganized this decade.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-full-time-staff-augmented-by-specialized-services">Smaller Full-Time Staff Augmented by Specialized Services</h3>
<p>Profit per employee <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-new-metrics-of-corporate-performance-profit-per-employee">has been steadily rising</a> in the past two decades. This trend will continue as companies build a narrowly focused core team around their primary value driver and use a combination of outsourcing, specialized service providers, and artificial intelligence to accomplish supporting functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Iuod8I5.png" alt="Diagram of small core, satellite services"></p>
<p>A few trends are facilitating this ongoing shift.</p>
<p>First, as global communication breaks down barriers between commerce, companies that want to stand out have to focus on a narrow niche of specialization rather than be locationally focused. In the 2020s, it won’t make sense to try to be Chicago’s best digital agency. You’ll want to be the best digital agency for (insert specific industry) <em>in the world</em>. Networking and introductions will still matter, but connections can be made globally.</p>
<p>Another trend facilitating this change is the rise of the <a href="https://productizeandscale.com/what-is-productized-service/">productized service</a>. In this model, a service is packaged into a standard offering for a very specific customer and offered in a very specific way. The customer doesn’t get to go in and change the delivery mechanism or set all their own preferences because the service provider wants to capitalize on economies of scale by selling the service <em>the same way every time</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve already talked about AI, but this will be one of the biggest reasons companies will be able to run on a smaller core employee base. Even if large companies need departments for auxiliary functions like accounting, purchasing, and marketing, these teams will be smaller as they’ll rely on AI to get more done with fewer people.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.” - Malcolm X</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="k-12-school-stratification">K-12 School Stratification</h3>
<p>One of the trends I worry about most is the continued stratification of education in the 2020s. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/08/29/report-public-schools-more-segregated-now-than-40-years-ago/">Schools are more segregated today</a> than they were in the 1970s, and Covid-19 seems to have only accelerated this stratification of education.</p>
<p>Public schools have been struggling to offer a high-quality education to our top students while helping the millions of disadvantaged kids in our nation simply survive. Teachers are expected to do too much, but <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/how-teachers%E2%80%99-unions-handcuff-schools-12102.html">regressive unions</a> and <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/chart-of-the-day-administrative-bloat-in-us-public-schools/">growing administrative costs</a> make it impossible for schools to financially incentivize good teachers to stay around.</p>

November 28, 2020 | https://mark.mcnally.je/blog/post/What%20I%20learnt%20from%20launching%20my%20new%20product%20on%20reddit | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mark.mcnally.je/blog/post/What%20I%20learnt%20from%20launching%20my%20new%20product%20on%20reddit">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p>I Launched my new website <a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> only using Reddit. I did not
use the normal routes of Product hunt, hacker news and all that jazz. I did not
think this product was "worthy" of those platforms. In fact calling it
a product is wrong, it's more of a tool. Not designed to make money (besides
donations ;)) and more to actually be something that is occasionally useful to people.</p>
<p>But anyway, onto the results of my very small launch.</p>
<h2>The results</h2>
<p>If you just want to know the outcome of the launch here are the stats</p>
<ul>
<li>ðŸ‘� 1300 People viewed my website</li>
<li>ðŸ“ˆ 50 people, or 3.8% of people registered with my website</li>
</ul>
<p>Those stats might not seem very impressive, but to me, with the very small
amount of launching I did, I think that they are pretty good.</p>
<p>Read on to find out what I learnt from this launch, how you can do it and what
I would do differently.</p>
<h2>What Subreddits?</h2>
<p>You can't just post onto Reddit, you have to post into a sub community,
a Subreddit</p>
<p>Picking the correct ones is very important.</p>
<h3>Technology Subreddits</h3>
<p>I launched on Subreddits to do with the technology I was using and the
Subreddits where I thought people would get the most use out of the "tool". </p>
<p>I wanted to launch on more Subreddits. However Subreddit rules can be very
strict around self promotion. Most of Reddit is against self promotion unless
that's the main purpose of the Subreddit.</p>
<p>The technology for my website is Django, so I launched on 2 subs that I frequent
often:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/jqfx30/using_django_i_made_a_website_that_lets_you/">r/django</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/comments/jqi0zq/i_made_a_website_in_django_that_lets_you_convert/">r/djangolearning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend launching on Subreddits that are related to your technology,
especially if you can help people in the comments. I know I appreciate it when
someone builds something using a technology that I use. It almost motivates people
on those Subreddits and shows what they can build. These Subreddits are also
relatively small so I can easily reply to every comment and my site would
hopefully not get "hugged to death".</p>
<p>I did not launch on the r/python and r/learnpython. I felt like it would not be
relevant to most people making python programs. Although in retrospect I would
probably do this.</p>
<p>Takeaway here is to launch on Subreddits relating to the technology that you
used to make the product. People on those Subreddits are interested in what they can make with the tech!</p>
<h3>Subreddits relating to the use of the tool</h3>
<p>I also launched on Subreddits for people who I think would most want to use the
tool. The users of this tool are people who already listen to podcasts
and watch Youtube videos. This is probably most people on Reddit. So
I narrowed it down further to; "what <em>I</em> specifically will use it for". This
helped, I use it to download lectures so I can listen to them offline. So
educational Subreddits and studying Subreddits. I posted on the following
Subreddits:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/jqfzzp/i_made_a_website_that_lets_you_convert_youtube/">r/productivity</a></li>
<li>r/frugallearning </li>
<li>r/GetStudying</li>
<li>r/Studytips</li>
</ul>
<p>The only Subreddit that garnered a response was r/productivity, in fact that
seems to be where I got the most response, turns out if you have a tool that
can improve productivity people on a productivity Subreddit will like it! I also custom tailored my
headline for this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I made a website that lets you convert Youtube videos into podcasts, I use it to listen to lectures in the car so I can at least feel like I am being productive when driving!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a useful and truthful statement, no lies or clickbait titles. It's what
people want to see and click on.</p>
<p>Be helpful, find a way to describe how your application is useful to the people
who will see your post. This is why I think posting on the general Subreddits
failed, what I said was not specific enough. I basically said what the tool did
and not a use case. I also used the term "completely free" for example on
r/studytips I posted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I made a completely free website that lets you convert youtube videos to podcasts. I find it useful to listen to lectures offline or when I am not at my computer :)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like the words "completely free" put people off, in retrospect it sounds
a bit clickbaity and also shady in a way, like I am going to steal your data or
the website is going to be plastered with ads kind of shady. I would not want
to click on that! </p>
<p>The r/productivity post was very successful, almost too successful. The
r/productivity Subreddit actually has a rule against promoting things as people
where being to spammy however I, and the productivity Subreddit community seemed to agree that my post was
relevant. I got a huge response from it before it was removed. I never did get
told why it was removed but I assume some moderator thought that even though my
website was very useful in boosting productivity it was against the rules.
Which I can't really argue with (as it was (I should have checked before posting)).</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the post.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of my productivity subreddit post" src="https://mark.mcnally.je/media/pagedown-uploads/reddit_productivity_post.png"></p>
<p>60 comments, 22 of those are by me. Thanking people, answering questions and
fixing bugs. It's very important to do this, go the extra mile for people using
your website, they are more likely to stick around. </p>
<p>In heindsight I should have posted to more educational Subreddits, perhaps
I will at a later date once some my site is a bit more up to date with features
and feedback. It is also useful to do a small product launch to see how your product
works with actual people using it.</p>
<h2>Subreddit Discovery</h2>
<p>To discover Subreddits, go to a Subreddit where you know it's audience will
like what you post - even if you are not "allowed" to post there. Reddit has
a "related subreddits" option that might give you a place where you can
actually post your product. Have a look at there sidebars, often there is
a helpful list of other Subreddits that are related to the sub you are
currently on.</p>
<p>For example, r/studying led me to r/studytips and all the other study related ones. 
This would be useful in my quest to find educational Subreddits, r/history is
likely to have a "learn history" Subreddit linked in the side bar. This is the
place where my tool would be useful.</p>
<h2>Spam</h2>
<p>Make sure to only post on Subreddits where you think your tool could truly be
helpful to people. Go in with the best intentions for the people, not as
a marketing person. Be honest and true, don't lie or write clikbait titles.
<em>Post something that you would click on</em>. </p>
<p>I did not apply this to all my posts, I learnt from this. You don't want to be
internet spam, that's pretty low and will likely tarnish your reputation (or,
well Reddit account)</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>So, how successful was this launch?</p>
<p>A week after posting, just over 1300 people have viewed my website.</p>
<p>Of those 1300, 50 people signed up to my website. Keep in
mind that you don't have to sign up to use the application<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. 50 people is
not much, but for a very small product launch it was more then I was expecting.
If I had launched on more Subreddits this number would be significantly higher.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is a good value, 3.8% of people who visited my website
signed up. To me that seems good! So, I guess that means it's good!</p>
<p>Some other stats that might be interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>~90 people viewed my personal website</li>
<li>~49 people viewed the donate page<ul>
<li>No one  donated, at the time there was no incentive for people to donate
  (although there is now ;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interesting Titbits</h2>
<p>70% of viewers were mobile based, Thankfully <a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> looks <em>ok</em> on mobile; well it also looks <em>ok</em> on desktop, not great, not terrible.</p>
<p>I started to get spam emails from companies trying to sell me massive datasets
of peoples data. I have not received this kind of spam before so I guess I did
something right to even get on the radar of these companies.</p>
<p>The website got featured on a <a href="https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/840995196/yeswas-podcast/346-podcast-lockdownowy">polish
podcast</a> I don't understand polish but at 24mins in they say "youtubetopodcast.com" which was kinda surreal to hear someone actually talking about something I made. Even if I did not understand it.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> is on page 2 of google when you search
"convert youtube videos to podcasts" ideally I would like it to be number 1,
but I have not done any SEO at all. </p>
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>Patch things fast! Listen and reply to everyone, especially if you are just
doing a small launch like I did. You can reply to everyone and if people see
you fixing bugs for people in the comments you will get a lot of respect.</p>
<p>I did not have a link for people to sign up to my mailing list to get updates
from me. I reckon a fair amount of people would have done that.</p>
<p>My blog did not have much content on it, the home page especially was pretty
boring. I should have had more content so those people who did visit my
blog actually got some benefit out of it.</p>
<p>I was worried that the server I was going to use was not going to be powerful
enough, in fact it was! Although it was limited by CPU cores. If you wanted to
know the server is a cheap VPS from OVH, nothing fancy. You don't need anything
fancy if you are just doing a small launch.</p>
<p>I Should have put my twitter link on <a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> especially
because I was posting some updates about the application on there.</p>
<p>Next time I do something like this I will also post on more Subreddits.
Although maybe limiting this as a "test" launch is a good idea?</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Post on relevant Subreddits</p>
<ul>
<li>Find relevant Subreddits by looking at the sidebar of bigger Subbreddits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't post spammy, clickbaity or anything that might come of as "shady"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have links to your personal website and your socials and give
  insensitive for people to click on them - "follow me on twitter for updates"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give people an incentive to give you money. However I don't think launching
  necessarily needs to be monetised, I feel like if I had spent a couple
hours writing some basic premium features some people might have paid for
them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclude</h2>
<p>I will relaunch my website on Reddit again, this time I will be better and
follow the advice that I have layed out in this post. At the time I did not
know this stuff but now I do (hopefully you have learnt something as well). </p>
<p>Admittedly I did get quite lucky with the r/productivity response and this is
not the …</p></div></div>

</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>
<span>This content was published on November 26, 2020 - 11:34</span>
<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

<p>Taking inspiration from them, I am launching <a href="https://nojs.club/">The NoJS Club</a>. As the name suggests, it’s a showcase of the Javascript-less web. While we can debate the merits of Javascript endlessly, without changing anyone’s mind, I’d like to highlight how I built the nojs.club website itself.</p>

<p>I had two main goals with this project. First, adding a new website should not require someone to go through the cumbersome process of forking the repo and sending a pull request. Second, ongoing maintenance of the website should be reduced as much as possible.</p>

<p>As you can guess, there’s an <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">xkcd</a> for that:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOzKm7u.png" alt=""></p>

<p>While I don’t expect the project to go viral, it was a fun learning opportunity. I decided to fully operationalize it through Github: Github Actions for adding new websites to the list, and Github Pages for hosting the resulting webpage.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Github Actions, this is a good intro from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions">Github docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full flow in nojs.club is like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Someone <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=nojsrequest.md&amp;title=example.com">opens an issue</a> suggesting a new website. The issue must follow the set template.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Github Actions Workflow kicks off and</p>

    <p>a. Extracts the domain of the request (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L32-L37">code ref</a>)</p>

    <p>b. Find any use of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Good ol’ <code>curl</code> and <code>grep</code> come in handy here (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L39-L64">code ref</a>)</p>

    <p>c. Post a comment on the issue with any Javascript found (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L66-L72">code ref</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once that happens, someone (me) must manually approve the request. I must post a comment in the format <code>/approve example.com 123.45</code> where the numbers refer to the total size of downloaded assets in KB. Another workflow then kicks off and adds the domain to a CSV file in the same repo (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L80-L111">code ref</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UONdXnW.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Note: While I can also automate the approval itself, I did not want to risk adding bad data to the list.</em></p>

<p>Excluding the latency for me to respond, this takes under a minute.</p>

<p>When a new commit is pushed to the repo, a <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/main/.github/workflows/github-pages.yml">different workflow</a> builds and pushes the Jekyll-based site to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. That process takes a couple of minutes.</p>

<h2 id="some-gotchas">Some gotchas</h2>

<p>While the resulting process and code is relatively easy to follow and reason about, it did take a lot of head-banging for me to get it working end-to-end.</p>

<h4 id="fail-fast-shell">Fail-fast shell</h4>

<p>The default shell that Github provides fails fast: <code>-eo pipefail</code>. What that means is that any command with a non-zero exit code will fail the job.</p>

<p>Little did I know that <code>grep</code> by default returns an exit code of <code>1</code> when no match is found:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo "hello world" | grep hi
$ echo $?
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bash script in a fail-fast shell, thus, ends up failing with an exit code of <code>1</code>, and <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/runs/1456173513?check_suite_focus=true">no useful logs</a>.</p>

<h4 id="no-local-dev-environment">No local dev environment</h4>

<p>The lack of a full-fledged local dev environment for Github Actions meant that my development flow was slow and unpredictable. I would modify the action, push it, then test using real issues. This results in so much time being spent just waiting to test.</p>

<p>I would urge Github to put out a real test environment that stubs events.</p>

<h4 id="jekyll-versioning">Jekyll versioning</h4>

<p>The website is built using Jekyll like I mentioned. Because I wanted the list of websites to be sorted by size of the web page, I had to do an in-memory sort (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blame/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/index.md#L28">code ref</a>). That worked well locally, but not when rendered by Github Pages.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/e9LOuEU.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After some digging, I found that Github uses Jekyll 3.9.0 while my local install had 4.0.1. That seemed like a likely culprit, and as I found was <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651">widely reported</a>. Github has shown no interest in upgrading Jekyll, so the workaround for me was to build the Jekyll site on every commit using - you guessed it - Github Action (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/github-pages.yml#L13">code ref</a>).</p>

<h4 id="trigger-action-on-commit">Trigger action on commit</h4>

<p>When a commit is made through a Github Action, by default the resulting action does not trigger any Github Action Workflows. As <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">Github explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you use the repository’s GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks on behalf of the GitHub Actions app, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good default. However, this means that when my Github Action adds a new website to the CSV, it does not trigger a Jekyll build. A simple solution for this is to use a personal access token instead of the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L85">code ref</a>).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are of course many ways to implement a similar project, some better than others. In the end, this was a good project to learn some new skills, build something that aligns with <a href="https://goel.io/about#principles">my principles</a>, and join a <del>viral trend</del> fad.</p>

<p>Now go remove all Javascript from your website and <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=nojsrequest.md&amp;title=example.com">add it to the list</a>.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Metabolic reprogramming and cell death evasion are hallmarks of many cancers, implicating the mitochondria in carcinogenesis. Study of mutations to the mitochondria’s miniature circular genome have identified cancer-specific mutation patterns that may be relevant to cancer initiation/progression.</p>
<p><br> Mitochondria are the power generators of the cell, wherein a system of proteins embedded in the inner membrane generate the universal energy currency of the cell, ATP. In addition to their canonical role in cell metabolism, they are involved in other myriad processes in inflammation and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Cancer cells are characterized by high energy requirements, unchecked proliferation, and avoidance of cell death controls, so mitochondria are hypothesized to play a central role in the genesis and progression of cancer (<span>Hertweck and DesDasgupta (2017)</span>; <span>Brandon, Baldi, and Wallace (2006)</span>; <span>Zong, Rabinowitz, and White (2016)</span>; <span>Hanahan and Weinberg (2011)</span>).</p>
<p>The mitchondrion is believed to have originated from a bacteria, engulfed by a pre-eukaryotic cell around 1 billion years ago. The mitochondrion possesses it’s own small genome, about 16.6 kb long, encoding 13 proteins that form the cellular respiration machinery of the organelle. The genome also encodes 22 transfer RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs (<span>Hertweck and DesDasgupta (2017)</span>). Mutations to the mitochondrial genome have been associated with many cancer types, although the mechanism of action of many of these mutations is unclear.</p>
<p>In the nuclear genome, there is remarkable heterogeneity in common and rare variants between genes and across cancer types. Greater than 90% of mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are singletons, meaning they appear once across the TCGA sequenced tumors. Previous research used a non-parametric Bayesian methods developed in the fields of ecology and computational linguistics to mine cancer-specific signals from the ‘hidden genome’ of previously unseen mutations (<span>Chakraborty et al. (2019)</span>). This research represented an novel way of examining mutation in human cancer by focusing on the mutations that have yet to be documented.</p>
<p>High depth, multi-sample molecular characterizations of the mitochondrial genome have illustrated a number of parallels between mtDNA and nuclear DNA in relation to their mutational landscapes (<span>Yuan et al. (2020)</span>). Mutational hotspots (which have been well documented in the nuclear genome) were observed in the regulatory D loop and the <em>ND4</em> gene. <em>ND5</em> was the most frequently mutated gene, <em>ND4</em> was most frequently mutated in prostate and lung cancers, and <em>COX1</em> was most frequently mutated in breast, cervical, and bladder cancers. Yuan et al.&nbsp;identified that truncating mutations were enriched in kidney, colorectal, and thyroid cancers, while copy number variants showed remarkable heterogeneity between cancers. In summary, like the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome contains an exotic and rich diversity of mutations between genes and between cancer types.</p>
<p>This project aims to surveill the landscape of single nucleotide variants in the cancer mitochondrial genome, with a special emphasis on applying bayesian nonparametric methods to estimate previously unseen variant signals in the mitochondrial genome. 5% of global cancer diagnoses are of unknown tissue of origin and are associated with poor health outcomes; a systematic, data-driven dive into uncovering the mutational hallmarks of different cancers in the mitochondrial genome could help improve or sophisticate attempts at classifying cancers based on a cancer’s mutation profile.</p>

<div id="the-data">
<h2>The Data</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We analyzed SNV data from 2177 tumor samples spanning 22 tissues from The Cancer Mitochondria Atlas. We used a table scraped from MitoMap to map variants to particular genomic features</p>



<p>There has been limited research on the frequencies of rare variation within the mitochondrial genome across several tissue types. Yuan et al.&nbsp;created The Cancer Mitochondria Atlas (TCMA), an open-access web portal to support research and education surrounding mitochondrial cancer genetics. The portal contains open source somatic variant, copy number, nuclear transfer data, and a coexpression dataset. This project will restrict its focus to analysis of somatic variant mutations.</p>
<p>The TCMA somatic variant data data contains 7611 instances of somatic variant mutations across 2177 tumor samples spanning 36 primary sites and histologies. The data includes the ‘sample_id’, which corresponds to the unique identifier for each patient/tumor sample. The ‘cancer_type’ column denotes the tissue of origin and histology of each cancer. The ‘chrom’ column is ‘MT’ indicating all data comes form the mitochondrial genome. ‘position’ denotes the locus of mutation along the 16.6 kb mitochondrial genome. ‘ref’ and ‘var’ denote what the unmutated reference nucleotide is and what the mutated variant nucleotide idenity is. ‘var_type’ denoets the kind of mutation: noncoding, synonymous, nonsynonymous, etc. We generated a few additional variables, chiefly ‘SBS’, which denotes the direction of nucleotide change and ‘n_tumor’, which denotes the number of tumors of that particular cancer_type in the dataset.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We propose using nonparametric statistical methods developed in the fields of computational linguistics and statistical ecology to mutations in the mitochondrial genome. These methods estimate quantitaties and probabilities of hitherto unseen variants.</p>

Alexander Corbet’s study of the richness of Malayan butterfly species sparked the development of statistical methods to solve the ’Unseen Species Problem.
</p>
</div>

<p>In the early 1940’s, naturalist Alexander Corbet spent two years in Malaya trapping butterflies. At the end of his time in Malaya, Corbet constructed a table of species frequencies, denoting how many species he captured once, twice, etc.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<p>When Corbet returned to England, he asked R.A. Fisher to estimate the number of new species he would capture if he spent an additional 2 years trapping butterflies. This problem referred to the column of the table with frequency 0 (the unseen species in the population of Malayan butterflies), of which there was no data available. Fisher provided an elegant and simple answer to Corbet’s question, an alternating sum of the species frequencies: <span>\[\textrm{# New Species in 2 more years trapping}=118-74+44-24...=75\]</span> Good and Toulmin extended Fisher’s work using a surprisingly simple formula for estimating the number of novel species one would capture if they conducted a survey of <span>\(t\)</span> times the original survey effort. Although estimation was only good for <span>\(t&lt;1\)</span>. Realizing the limitations of previous estimators, and identified a family of estimators that could provably predict the number of novel species all the way up to <span>\(t \propto \log{n}\)</span> (<span>Orlitsky, Theertha, and Wu (2016)</span>). This family of estimators works by truncating the alternating series at a random location <span>\(L\)</span>, and then averages over the distribution of <span>\(L\)</span>. Indeed, the bias of the estimator depends on whether you truncate the series after an addition or subtraction term. Averaging the estimator over various cutoff locations helps control the bias.</p>
<p>I applied the Smoothed Good-Toulmin estimator available through the R package variantprobs, as well as the Chao estimate of the total number of unseen variants based on the training mutation frequencies.</p>

<h3>Smoothed Good-Turing Frequency Estimation: A Gentle Introduction</h3>
<p>Suppose, like Alexander Corbet, you are going to go for a butterfly catching expedition. After you strap on your boots, sun hat, and binoculars, you finally grab your notebook, a catalogue of the butterfly species you have encountered on previous expeditions. In your book, there is a list of butterfly species along with the number of times you have caught each species (above).</p>
<p>Where <span>\(N_1\)</span> denotes the number of species you caught once, <span>\(N_2\)</span> the number of species you caught twice, etc. But, like Corbet, you haven’t caught every butterfly in your field guide yet. There are some butterflies that remain unseen in your population. Instead of estimating how many butterfly species were unseen in the population, you are interested in the <em>probability</em> that you capture one of these rare butterfly species in your morning expedition.</p>
<p>If we want to calculate the probability that the next butterfly we catch belongs to <span>\(N_r\)</span> (was previously observed <span>\(r\)</span> times): <span>\(P(\textrm{Next object seen r …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

            <p>We want to know if things are fair. Do some groups of people tend to get a raw deal in company hiring or university admissions or court sentences?</p>

<p>There <em>seems</em> to be an obvious way to answer such questions: Get some data and “check” for bias. But different people often get different results, even when looking at the same data. What’s going on?</p>

<p>What’s going on is the whole strategy is <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/11/16/simpsons-paradox-and-the-tyranny-of-strata/">doomed</a>. It’s counterintuitive, but you usually <em>can’t</em> determine bias this way. The problem boils down to that in order to “check” for bias you must do something to your data called <em>stratification</em>. This can totally change the results, and there’s no single best way to do it.</p>



<p>Let’s do a thought experiment. You live in a city inhabited by blue people and red people. There are constant debates about if police are biased against either of these groups. Eventually, you decide to take action. You find 1024 blue men and 1024 red men, give each a suspicious looking stack of $20 bills and tell them to jog outside for an hour while holding the stack. Finally, you count the number that are arrested in each group.  (You have a <em>very</em> good relationship with your local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board">IRB</a>.)</p>



<p>So you run the experiment, and these are the results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
      <th>blue arrested</th>
      <th>red arrested</th>
      <th>% blue arrested</th>
      <th>% red arrested</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1024</td>
      <td>1024</td>
      <td>232</td>
      <td>280</td>
      <td>22.7</td>
      <td>27.3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>More reds were arrested than blues. Does this show police bias against reds?</p>



<p>You show your data to a friend. She notices that the blue men in your population were more often old (over 35) while the red men were more often young (35 or less). In particular, your data has these demographics:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>384</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>640</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>She re-does your analysis separately for young and old men. The results are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
      <th>blue arrested</th>
      <th>red arrested</th>
      <th>% blue arrested</th>
      <th>% red arrested</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>84</td>
      <td>44</td>
      <td>13.1</td>
      <td>11.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>148</td>
      <td>236</td>
      <td>38.5</td>
      <td>36.9</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now this suggests a bias against <em>blue</em> men. The police arrest young blue men more often than young red men, and similarly for the old. The reason the previous analysis suggested a bias against red men is that more of them are young.</p>

<p>Does this now show that the police are biased against blues?</p>



<p>Your friend pokes at the data some more. She points out that reds are more likely to live in Riverview, while blues are more likely to live in Pineway. Specifically, you have these demographics:</p>

      <td>young</td>
      <td>128</td>
      <td>384</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>She re-does the analysis for each location / age group. These are the results:</p>

<p>In each age-location group, reds were more often arrested than blues. The difference from the previous analysis is that blues tend to live in Pineway, and police more often arrest people in Pineway.</p>

<p>This suggests a bias against reds. But, given how things have changed in the past, something feels off…</p>



<p>Sweating, you ask your friend, “<em>Now</em> are we done?”</p>

<p>She says, “Almost! I just noticed that clothing seems to be a factor! Reds tend to wear joggers while blues tend to wear shorts. Just give me a second…”</p>

<p>She re-does the analysis yet again, with the following results.</p>

<p>Now, the percentages are exactly the same in each group. The police tend to arrest young men in Pineway wearing joggers. They tend not to arrest old men in Riverview wearing shorts. All the racial differences you saw before might be due to correlations between race and age, neighborhood, and attire, not because of race <em>itself</em>.</p>



<p>You tell your friend “Well done! You’ve resolved it. It’s getting late, I think I’ll be going…”</p>

<p>As you edge towards the door she says “Yeah, goodnight, let’s do this again! But before you leave, I did notice that some people wear headphones and some don’t…”</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with Simpson’s paradox, this is all basically an example of a <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/11/16/simpsons-paradox-and-the-tyranny-of-strata/">“recursive” Simpson’s paradox</a>.</p>



<p>What went “wrong” in this experiment? Suppose you gather data on police interactions with people of a single race. No one would be surprised if the statistics are different with respect to the young vs. old or urban vs. rural or rich vs. poor or churchgoers vs. nonreligious. It would be surprising if there <em>weren’t</em> differences.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to use observational data to prove police are biased against red people. To do this, you need to split up all red and blue people into subgroups (“strata”) in such a way that each subgroup of red people is “exactly the same” as the corresponding subgroup, except for their race.</p>

<p>This is basically an impossible task. Human beings are complicated and multidimensional. To a first approximation, <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/10/08/police-violence-your-ratios-dont-prove-what-you-think-they-prove/">race is correlated with everything</a>. There’s just too many attributes to firmly establish that <em>any</em> observed difference is really due to race and not to something else that’s correlated with race. However much you try to split people up, there will still be remaining differences between each “red group” and each “blue group” you haven’t accounted for. For the same reason, you can’t use observational data to prove there <em>isn’t</em> bias.</p>

<p>If you want to measure fairness, you need to <em>intervene</em>. We’ll discuss that more next time.</p>

In doing so we propose a new formulation for an experience-based mapping framework as an effective solution to the key issues of city-scale SLAM scalability, robustness, map updates and all-time all-weather performance required by a production system. Furthermore, we propose an effective way of synchronising SLAM systems to deliver seamless real-time localisation of multiple edge devices at the same time. All this in the presence of network latency and bandwidth limitations. The resulting system is deployed and tested at scale in San Francisco where it delivers AR experiences in a mapped area of several hundred kilometers. To foster further development of this area we offer the data set to the public, constituting the largest of this kind to date.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

November 28, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In this short tutorial, you will learn to obtain the realtime/current weather conditions of any city in python. We are going to make use of the weather API from <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" target="_blank"><span>www.weatherapi.com</span></a>.</p>

<p>WeatherAPI is a service that provides weather data, including realtime weather data, forecasts, and historical data to developers for use in applications and other services.</p>

<p>Before using their API, you have to signup for a free account and generate an API key. You will need the API key for accessing their service.</p>

<p>We will use the Python Requests module for accessing the API. If you are not familiar with Requests, checkout Introduction to <a href="https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/making-requests-python-requests-library/">Python's Requests library</a>.</p>

<p>Install the requests module by running:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>



<h2>Retrieving the Current weather data</h2>

<p>Before we make the request, first we will create these variables:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><code>base_url </code>, which stores the API's URL which is <span>http://api.weatherapi.com/v1.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>api_key</code>, stores your API key</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>city</code>, the city whose weather data is needed.</p>
	</li>
</ol>



<pre><code>import requests

api_key = "your_API_key"
base_url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
city = "london"

parameters = {"key":api_key, "q":city}         # URL parameters
r = requests.get(f"{base_url}/current.json", params=parameters)

data = r.json()         # retrieve the json data

print(data)</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{'location': {'name': 'London', 'region': 'City of London, Greater London', 'country': 'United
Kingdom', 'lat': 51.52, 'lon': -0.11, 'tz_id': 'Europe/London', 'localtime_epoch': 1606304125,
'localtime': '2020-11-25 11:35'}, 'current': {'last_updated_epoch': 1606302905, 'last_updated': 
2020-11-25 11:15', 'temp_c': 13.0, 'temp_f': 55.4, 'is_day': 1, 'condition': {'text': 'Partly
cloudy', 'icon': '//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/116.png', 'code': 1003}, 'wind_mph': 8.1,
'wind_kph': 13.0, 'wind_degree': 200, 'wind_dir': 'SSW', 'pressure_mb': 1011.0, 'pressure_in': 30.3,
'precip_mm': 0.1, 'precip_in': 0.0, 'humidity': 82, 'cloud': 75, 'feelslike_c': 11.9, 'feelslike_f':
53.5, 'vis_km': 10.0, 'vis_miles': 6.0, 'uv': 3.0, 'gust_mph': 11.9, 'gust_kph': 19.1}}</code></pre>

<p>The output is a python dictionary therefore, we can easily get the data we want from it by indexing.</p>

<p>Now let's parse this data into a nice piece of information</p>

<pre><code>import requests

api_key = "your_API_key"
base_url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
city = "london"

parameters = {"key":api_key, "q":city}         # URL parameters
r = requests.get(f"{base_url}/current.json", params=parameters)

data = r.json()         # retrieve json


# retriving Data

location = data['location']['name']
time = data['location']['localtime']

condition = data['current']['condition']['text']     
temperature_celcius = data['current']['temp_c']
temperature_farenheit = data['current']['temp_f']
feelslike_celcius = data['current']['feelslike_c']
wind_direction = data['current']['wind_dir']


# printing data
print(f"Location: {location}")
print(f"Current Time: {time}")
print()
print(f"Weather Condition: {condition}")
print(f"Temperature in Celcius: {temperature_celcius}")
print(f"Temperature in farenheit: {temperature_farenheit}")
print()
print(f"Temperature feels like: {feelslike_celcius} Celcius")
print(f"Wind Direction: {wind_direction}")</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Location: London
Current Time: 2020-11-25 11:53

Weather Condition: Light rain
Temperature in Celcius: 14.0
Temperature in farenheit: 57.2

Temperature feels like: 13.1 Celcius
Wind Direction: SSW
</code></pre>

It seems 2019 was the best year for the periodic table as well with 2020 bringing bad news for it as scientists have proposed a new periodic table that seems to be more useful than the existing one.</p><p>That periodic table was created back in 1869 by Dmitri Mendeleev and it is one of the most significant achievements in science, capturing the essence not only of chemistry but also of physics, medicine, earth sciences, and biology.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic.jpg" alt="periodic.jpg" width="754" height="400" srcset="https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic.jpg 754w, https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic-300x159.jpg 300w, https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic-180x95.jpg 180w, https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic-360x191.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px"></a></p><p>You can see thousands of different versions of the periodic table ranging from spiral versions to simple lists but what made Mendeleev’s version so popular was the fact that he used an element’s atomic number to group them together and it showed that the grouped elements exhibited similar properties. People tried making more periodic tables using the number of electrons, neutrons, or a combination of both for newer tables but they all lacked something fundamental – similar behavior in different properties.</p><p>The <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c07857" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new periodic table</a> proposed by Zahed Allahyari and Artem Oganov using something called the Mendeleev Number (MN). Latest studies use a combination of two fundamental quantities to derive MN; an element’s atomic radius and a property called electronegativity which describes how strongly an atom attracts electrons to itself.</p><p>This approach groups together elements that can form binary compounds like Na and CL can make NaCl. It can help to predict the properties of binary compounds that haven’t been made yet. I’m not a chemist so you might derive more information from this approach. Nevertheless, it will be useful in the search for new materials without needing to test them physically.</p><p>Image Source: <a href="https://theconversation.com/periodic-table-scientists-propose-new-way-of-ordering-the-elements-150881" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TheConversation</a></p><p>Like our stories?

        	<p>An unofficial addition has been made to a sign welcoming drivers to Toronto that casts the province’s capital in a less than flattering light.</p>
<p>The sign, on the border with Mississauga along Burnamthorpe Road, used to read “Welcome to Toronto. Ontario’s capital.” With the unauthorized addendum, it now reads “Ontario’s capital in overdose deaths.”</p>
<p>The addition appears to be a plank covered in a vinyl sign, printed to mimic the original sign’s colours and font, attached below it with zip-ties.</p>
<p>CityNews viewers alerted us to the changes and say a few signs in the area have been altered in this manner.</p>

<p>According to the chief coroner’s office, an estimated 50 to 80 people per week are dying of overdoses in Ontario.</p>
<p>Across the country, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the opioid crisis. Opioid overdoses have risen sharply since March as the border closure and limited access to services raise fatal risks for drug users.</p>
<p>It is unclear who created the additional signage and whether it is in fact referring to this disturbing rise in numbers — a stark reversal of the 13 per cent decline in fatal opioid overdoses between 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>The signs were addressed in the city’s daily COVID-19 briefing question and answer session on Monday.</p>
<p>Mayor John Tory said he has repeatedly expressed “deep concern” about the overdose rates and feels not enough attention has been given to the issue.</p>
<p>“While this isn’t necessarily the single best way to draw attention to this, it is something that’s got us talking about it and I think the more we talk about it the more we advocate for greater action on the part of all governments,” said Tory.</p>
<p>Tory said Toronto Public Health has a “significant harm reduction program,” but added that the city needs more provincial support.</p>
<p>The city said the signs have been addressed by city staff and have now been corrected.</p>

<p>Pine64 is graciously giving away the <strong>PineCone BL602 RISC-V Evaluation Board</strong> to folks participating in the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/"><strong>PineCone Nutcracker Challenge</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's learn about the PineCone Board... And how it helps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V"><strong>RISC-V Open Source Ecosystem</strong></a>.</p>

<p>PineCone is based on the BL602 combo chipset made by <a href="https://www.bouffalolab.com/bl602">Nanjing-based Bouffalo Lab</a>...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Low Cost</strong>: BL602 is a <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs">General Purpose 32-bit Microcontroller</a>. (Think <a href="https://medium.com/@ly.lee/create-your-iot-gadget-with-apache-mynewt-and-stm32-blue-pill-d689b3ca725?source=friends_link&amp;sk=d511426d5a2217ebd06789b3eef7df54">STM32 Blue Pill</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@ly.lee/coding-nrf52-with-rust-and-apache-mynewt-on-visual-studio-code-9521bcba6004?source=friends_link&amp;sk=bb4e2523b922d0870259ab3fa696c7da">Nordic nRF52</a>)</p>
<p>But BL602 supports Bluetooth LE AND 2.4 GHz WiFi... At the <strong>low low price of an ESP8266</strong>.</p>
<p><em>That's a game changer!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Efficient</strong>: BL602 is perfect for wearables and other power-constrained devices. (Maybe even PineTime!)</p>
<p>By performance, BL602 belongs to the same class of microcontrollers as Nordic nRF52832. BL602 won't run Linux, <a href="https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/pinetime">but neither does PineTime</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CPU is based on RISC-V, not Arm</strong>: Yep this scares most people, because BL602 will NOT run code compiled for Arm processors. Instead we need to use the <a href="https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/">32-bit RISC-V version of the GCC compiler</a> to recompile our programs.</p>
<p>FreeRTOS has been ported to BL602. (<a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/components/bl602">More details</a>) But other Real Time Operating Systems (like <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>, <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> and <a href="https://mynewt.apache.org/">Mynewt</a>) have been slow to adopt RISC-V. (We'll learn why in a while)</p>
<p>Rust runs perfectly fine on RISC-V microcontrollers. (<a href="https://medium.com/@ly.lee/porting-apache-mynewt-os-to-gigadevice-gd32-vf103-on-risc-v-4054a5922493?source=friends_link&amp;sk=215cd06186d912277d0469224666d60d">Here's the proof</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's great that Pine64 is reaching out to the Open Source Community through the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/">PineCone Nutcracker initiative</a>... Because it takes A Humongous Village to get BL602 ready for real-world gadgets.</p>

<p><em>How does BL602 compare with ESP32?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BL602 is a <strong>General Purpose Microcontroller</strong> that supports Bluetooth LE and WiFi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ESP32 is more of a <strong>Bluetooth LE + WiFi Controller</strong> that supports Embedded Programs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To folks who are familiar with Arm microcontrollers (STM32 Blue Pill, Nordic nRF52), BL602 looks like another microcontroller... Except that it runs on the <a href="https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/"><strong>RISC-V Instruction Set</strong></a> instead of Arm.</p>
<p>Hope this addresses the confusion over BL602, as discussed <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24916086">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24877335">here</a></p>
<p><em>(There's a new <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_C3">ESP32 based on RISC-V</a>, but the hardware is not available yet so we'll wait and see. <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterTechBlog/status/1332859286142128131?s=20">Compare BL602 with ESP32-C3</a>)</em></p>

<p><em>Why not stick with Arm? Why get adventurous with RISC-V?</em></p>
<p>Nintendo Switch (the #1 gaming console) runs on Arm. iPhone and the new M1 Macs also run on Arm.  <strong>Most of our gadgets are powered by Arm today.</strong></p>
<p>Before Arm gets too successful and locks us in... Shouldn't we explore alternatives like RISC-V?</p>

<p>32-bit RISC-V microcontrollers all run on the same core instruction set.</p>
<p><em>So the same firmware should run on different brands of RISC-V microcontrollers... Right?</em></p>
<p>Nope! Because across different brands of RISC-V microcontrollers...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Peripherals and Input/Output Ports</strong> are implemented differently: Timer, GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exceptions and Interrupts</strong> also work differently on various RISC-V microcontrollers.</p>
<p>(FYI: Arm microcontrollers all handle Exceptions and Interrupts the same way)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not so straightforward to port existing RISC-V firmware to BL602.</p>

<p><em>How bad is the RISC-V firmware portability problem?</em></p>
<p>Let's compare BL602 with the two most popular models of 32-bit RISC-V microcontrollers...</p>

<p>As we can see, firmware support is not so great for newer RISC-V microcontrollers.</p>
<p>Firmware created for Pinecil will NOT run on PineCone... Even the simplest firmware for blinking the LED!</p>

<p><em>How do we create portable firmware for RISC-V?</em></p>
<p>We'll have to isolate the differences with a layer of low-level firmware code known as the <strong>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</strong>.</p>
<p>So when we port the firmware from, say, Pinecil to PineCone, we need to replace the HAL for GD32 VF103 by the HAL for BL602.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/components/hal_drv">Check out the BL602 HAL</a></p>

<p><em>Sounds like a lot of tedious repetitive work. Is there a sustainable way to create portable firmware for RISC-V?</em></p>
<p>Yes, by <strong>adopting a modern Embedded Operating System</strong> like <a href="https://mynewt.apache.org/">Mynewt</a>, <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> and <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>.</p>
<p>These operating systems expose a high-level API for various Peripherals (Timers, GPIO, I2C, SPI, ...) that works across multiple microcontrollers (for both Arm and RISC-V).</p>
<p>But first we need to port Mynewt, RIOT and Zephyr to BL602. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/"><strong>PineCone Nutcracker</strong></a> initiative helps to accelerate the porting process. We'll pool together the necessary skills and software from the Open Source Community, to make this work.</p>
<p><em>Is there hope for Mynewt / RIOT / Zephyr on BL602?</em></p>
<p>I shall be porting Mynewt + Rust to BL602, and documenting the porting process. </p>
<p>Why? Because it's an educational exercise that helps us better understand the BL602 internals.</p>
<p>And it will be a helpful reference for porting other Embedded Operating Systems to BL602.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the harder PineCone Nutcracker Challenge: Reverse engineering the Bluetooth LE and WiFi drivers for BL602...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-compare.jpg" alt="BL602 Memory Map vs SiFive FE310: Totally different"></p>
<p><em>BL602 Memory Map (left) vs SiFive FE310 (right): Totally different</em></p>

<p>BL602 feels exciting. The mass market RISC-V microcontrollers never had onboard Bluetooth LE and WiFi... Until now!</p>
<p>Unfortunately we don't have complete documentation about the implementation of BLE and WiFi on BL602. (And I totally understand if there are commercial reasons for this omission)</p>
<p>But we have the compiled RISC-V libraries that we may Reverse Engineer to understand the BLE and WiFi implementation.</p>
<p>That's the crux of the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/"><strong>PineCone Nutcracker Challenge</strong></a>... Decompile the Bluetooth LE and WiFi driver code, understand how the RISC-V code operates the wireless hardware.</p>
<p>Then reimplement the wireless functions the open source way. Perhaps by adapting the wireless drivers from <a href="https://mynewt.apache.org/">Mynewt</a> (<a href="https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble">NimBLE</a>), <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> and <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>.</p>
<p>Let's walk through one possible approach for Reverse Engineering the WiFi Driver. (I'm sure there are many other ways to do this, <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs/tree/main/hardware_notes">like this</a>)</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_docs/tree/main/BL602_RM/en">BL602 Reference Manual</a> (Page 17), we see that our RISC-V CPU talks to the WiFi Controller via the <strong><code>WRAM</code> Wireless RAM</strong> at address <code>0x4203 0000</code> onwards.</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-wram.png" alt="PineCone BL602 Wireless RAM"></p>
<p>Our WiFi Driver probably reads and writes WiFi packets to/from that 112 KB chunk of Shared Memory. The WiFi Control Registers may be inside too.</p>
<p>Let's find out which WiFi Driver functions use that chunk of RAM.</p>

<p>The WiFi Drivers that we wish to grok are located here...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/tree/master/blobs">WiFi Drivers <code>github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blobs</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>...Inside the files <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blob/master/blobs/libatcmd.a"><code>libatcmd.a</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blob/master/blobs/libbl602_wifi.a"><code>libbl602_wifi.a</code></a></p>
<p>Here is a sample BL602 app that calls the WiFi Functions in <code>libatcmd.a</code> and <code>libbl602_wifi.a</code>...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/bl602_demo_at">Sample WiFi App <code>bl602_demo_at</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The PineCone Community has helpfully generated the <strong>GCC Linker Map</strong> for the <code>bl602_demo_at</code> firmware (which includes <code>libatcmd.a</code> and <code>libbl602_wifi.a</code>)...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blob/master/blobs/bl602_demo_at.map">Linker Map <code>bl602_demo_at.map</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have loaded the <code>bl602_demo_at.map</code> Linker Map into a Google Sheet for analysis...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click here to open the Google Sheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16yHquQ6E4bVj43piwQxssa1RaUr9yq9oL7hVf224Ijk/edit#gid=381366828&amp;fvid=1359565135">PineCone BL602 AT Demo Linker Map</a></p>

<p>Click <code>Data</code> ➜  <code>Filter Views</code> ➜  <code>All Objects By Size</code></p>

<p>It takes a while to sort the objects... Be patient</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-linkermap.png" alt="PineCone BL602 AT Demo Linker Map"></p>
<p>Here we see the list of functions, global variables and static variables defined in <code>bl602_demo_at.map</code>, sorted by size. </p>
<p>Let's look at the first page of functions and variables.</p>
<p><em>(FYI: The Linker Maps loaded into Google Sheet for <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/bl602_demo_wifi"><code>bl602_demo_wifi</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/sdk_app_ble_sync"><code>sdk_app_ble_sync</code></a> are here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m8-fc9_ocOwMuw_oRur4j6xqVli6x-Tm-M5ZIKwNWRk/edit#gid=381366828&amp;fvid=1359565135">Google Sheet for <code>bl602_demo_wifi</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJev8fdmIMyIxeRFx2cpsq1C5rEYgGZf7Tank3hYK88/edit#gid=381366828&amp;fvid=1359565135">Google Sheet for <code>sdk_app_ble_sync</code></a>)</em></p>

<p>Remember that Wireless RAM starts at address <code>0x4203 0000</code>?  I have highlighted in yellow the 19 largest variables in Wireless RAM...</p>

<div><pre><span>__bss_start</span>
<span>__wifi_bss_start</span>
<span>rx_dma_hdrdesc</span>
<span>_data_load</span>
<span>ram_heap</span>
...</pre></div>
<p>(The addresses of the variables are shown in the <code>Offset</code> column)</p>
<p>These are likely the WiFi Buffers that our WiFi Driver uses to send and receive WiFi packets, also to control the WiFi operation.</p>

<p><code>rx_dma_hdrdesc</code> looks interesting. It could be the DMA buffer for receiving WiFi packets.  Let's find out which WiFi Function in the WiFi Driver uses <code>rx_dma_hdrdesc</code>...</p>
<p>We'll scan for <code>rx_dma_hdrdesc</code> (and other interesting variables) in the <strong>Decompiled RISC-V Assembly Code</strong> (<code>*.s</code>) that the PineCone Community has generated...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/tree/master/libatcmd"><code>libatcmd</code></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/tree/master/libbl602_wifi"><code>libbl602_wifi</code></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we'll be able to understand the Assembly Code and figure out how the WiFi Buffers are used to send and receive WiFi packets.</p>

<p>What's really inside the WiFi Controller? </p>
<p>Could there be some low-level chunk of executable code (non RISC-V) that runs <strong>inside</strong> the WiFi Controller to control the WiFi operations?</p>
<p>By studying the WiFi Buffers and the associated WiFi Functions, we may uncover the Code Blob that runs inside the WiFi Controller.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Compiling LLVM vs. using precompiled LLVM Libraries</h2><p>There are two options for creating your own LLVM pass: Your pass can either live directly inside the LLVM source tree or it can live outside in its own tree. In this blog post, I will go into detail about setting up an out of source LLVM pass.</p><p>The LLVM documentation suggests using a precompiled version of the LLVM libraries. This does come with some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p><img src="https://www.gymni.ch/images/table.svg"></p><p>To make your LLVM pass more flexible your build system should allow building either from source or from the precompiled LLVM libraries.</p><h2>Setting up the Build System</h2><p>Building a LLVM pass using the LLVM sources is not as simple as using precompiled LLVM libraries. LLVMs build system makes use of lots of custom CMake macros which have to be included in your build system for it to work right.</p><h2>Building the Pass</h2><h3>Detecting the configuration</h3><p>First we need to determine if we are building against the LLVM sources or a precompiled version of LLVM.</p><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>NOT</span> <span>PATH_TO_LLVM</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre><p>If we are using the precompiled LLVM libraries we use <code>PATH_TO_LLVM</code> to derive search paths CMake will look for the external project.</p><p><code>find_package</code> loads the CMake settings from the precompiled LLVM and allows us to manually add <code>LLVM_CMAKE_DIR</code> to the <code>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</code>. Now CMake will find all the macros defined by the precompiled LLVM libraries.</p><p>In case we are building from LLVM sources things get a little bit simpler. We just have to create a subdirectory where we want to put the files that are created when building LLVM. We will save the directories containing all LLVM headers in <code>LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS</code> for later use. At the end we again manually add the path to the CMake macros we want to use to <code>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</code> .</p><pre><code><span>include</span><span>(</span><span>LLVM-Config</span><span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span><span>HandleLLVMOptions</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre><p>Now we can include the set of CMake modules we want to use in our build system. Those modules will allow us to use LLVM specific CMake functions and macros like <code>add_llvm_library</code> and <code>add_llvm_executable</code>.</p><h3>Including LLVM Headers</h3><p>The directories containing the LLVM headers we saved to <code>LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS</code> before can now be included.</p><pre><code><span>include_directories</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><h3>Creating our Pass</h3><p>We are using the CMake function <code>add_llvm_library</code> to add our pass.</p><pre><code><span>add_llvm_library</span><span>(</span><span>OutOfTreeLLVMPass</span> <span>MODULE</span>

<span>)</span>
</code></pre><h2>Build the Pass</h2><p>After setting up the build system our pass can be built by creating a build directory and running CMake inside the build directory.</p><h3>Using sources</h3><p>Assuming the LLVM sources are located at <code>../llvm-project/llvm</code> and our pass is located at <code>../OutOfTreeLLVMPass</code></p><pre><code>cmake -DPATH_TO_LLVM<span>=</span>../llvm-project/llvm ../OutOfTreeLLVMPass

		<p><span><em>(5 minutes read)</em></span></p>
<p><span>My oldest son Noah turned 7 three months ago. If he could trade his family for a 2 hour session of playing minecraft, he would do it in a heartbeat. The other love of his life is Super Mario Maker, and&nbsp;it’s been a thrill to see him play the same game and levels that I played when I was his age. About 5 months ago, I left my family for my yearly pilgrimage of <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">ludum dare</a>: a game dev competition during which I lock myself away with friends, return to a&nbsp;state of primitive caveman, not sleep for 48h, and create&nbsp;a full game from scratch (play it at the end of this post!) As I proudly showed my revolutionary AAA title to my wife, Noah was naturally intrigued and I introduced him to the world of code, showing him how simple&nbsp;words&nbsp;(he had just learned how to read) produced an actual game. Since&nbsp;that very day, Noah&nbsp;has been asking me repeatedly to teach him how to make&nbsp;his own video games. And for the past 5 months, I have been looking for the holy grail of language/IDE for kids in the hope of turning that spark of interest into a memorable experience…</span></p>
<p><span>My quest has led me to&nbsp;endless forums, through which I have tried countless suggestions: SmallBasic, Pico-8, Smalltalk, Scratch, etc. I have even inquired of the Great&nbsp;Oracles of StackOverflow,&nbsp;to&nbsp;no avail. After 5 months,&nbsp;I&nbsp;ended up with a disappointing conclusion: nothing is even close to what I had back in another era. 30 years later, QBasic is still the best when it comes to&nbsp;discovering programming.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“OMG please don’t teach him GOTOs!!”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>10 PRINT “OH NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!!”
20 GOTO 10</code></pre>
<p><span>Yes, QBasic is a terrible procedural language. It introduces one to concepts widely considered harmful, uses awkward syntax for implicit declarations, is not case sensitive, is non-zero-based, etc. the list goes on… When developing a skill, it is much better to acquire the right reflexes from the start rather than have to correct years of bad practice. Following this advice, I should have probably started off with&nbsp;the basics of the ruby language which I love. Yet, while most of those QBasic concepts are today generally considered&nbsp;as red flags by our peers, they each served a very specific&nbsp;purpose at the time: to keep the language simple and accessible, a notion that every other language has left behind in favor of flexibility, complexity and logic.</span></p>
<p><span>I installed QBasic on my son’s 11” HP Stream today, having to hack a DOSBox manual installation. He double clicked the icon on his desktop and in a split second, we were in the IDE, greeted with the introduction screen which brought back so many memories to my mind:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/QBasic_Opening_Screen.png" alt="" width="640" height="400"></p>
<p><span>I then told Noah that there was a very sacred ritual, mandatory&nbsp;for anyone who enters the secret&nbsp;inner&nbsp;circle of programmers, to start off with a program that greets every other programmer out there. As I dictated the formula, he slowly&nbsp;searched for each&nbsp;key, carefully&nbsp;typing with his right finger&nbsp;the magic words: <code>PRINT “hello world”</code></span></p>
<p><span>He pressed F5 and looked amazed as he saw his code being compiled into text rendered on his black screen. He smiled, gave me a high-five, and then scribbled down the code in his little notebook so that he could remember later.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>We went on to a couple more commands: CLS, COLOR, PLAY, INPUT, and IF. There was nothing to explain: no complexity, no awkward operator, no abstract concepts, no documentation that needed to be read, no notion of objects/class/methods, no framework to install, no overwhelming menu/buttons in the IDE, no special keyword or parenthesis. It was code in its purest simplicity and form.</p>
<p><span>After less than an hour, he wrote his first program on his own – an interactive and incredibly subtle application which lets you know the computer’s feelings towards&nbsp;you as an individual and sensible human being:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>…which he ran with utmost pride for his cousin and best friend Christian:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>…after which he proceeded to easily explain him&nbsp;</span><span><b>how</b></span><span>&nbsp;it worked and what the code was doing!</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_5.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>And so it was that in a single hour, my 7 year old was able to not only write his first text game, but also to experience the fun and thrill that comes from creating, compiling and executing his own little program. Bonus points, it all fit on a single notebook page:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p><span>I was so glad that he was able to understand why I keep saying that I have the best job in the world.&nbsp;</span><span>My only regret today was to realize that in more than 30 years, we have not been able to come up with something&nbsp;better for our kids: Qbasic has a limited set of simple keywords (the entire help fits on a single F1 screen and is packed with simple examples!), does not distract the coder with any visual artifacts, has a very confined and cosy dev environment, shows errors as early as possible, compiles and executes the code in a heartbeat with a single key, and is extremely straightforward. &nbsp;We have built more robust and more complex languages/frameworks/IDEs (which are of course necessary for any real-life application), but we have never really made a simpler or more direct access to the thrill of programming than QBasic. Even running QBasic today has become dreadful&nbsp;to the novice that uses&nbsp;a modern Mac/PC/Linux machine, whereas it used to simply require inserting a 3,5” floppy in the A:\ disk drive…</span></p>
<p><span>Enough rant, today is all about the celebration of yet another person who discovered the excitement and beauty of programming!</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers!</span></p>

People love the idea of a new gadget that they “need” to buy, in this case, to get fit, but the question of whether or not these devices actually work is definitely up for debate.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-1n80q"><span><strong>What science is saying</strong> </span></h3><p id="viewer-at776"><span>There have been several studies that have discovered that fitness trackers won't necessarily help you get fit faster than simply doing it on your own.</span></p><p id="viewer-e71cl"><span>In 2016, the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2553448" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</u></a> published a 2-year study from the University of Pittsburgh, aimed at comparing “technology-enhanced weight loss” (with the use of fitness trackers) to “standard behavioural weight loss” (without trackers).</span></p><p id="viewer-9t0rj"><span>Over 24 months, 470 adults participated in the study (233 in the standard group, 237 in the enhanced group). The results determined that the group using smart trackers didn't lose as much weight as the group without (3.5 kg vs 5.9kg).</span></p><div id="viewer-87lfu"><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2553448" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_6caae631dc4d4a07aaaad9f8cc6fbbef~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_958%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_6caae631dc4d4a07aaaad9f8cc6fbbef~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></a></div><p id="viewer-50v8p"><span>Later a second study, published in <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(16)30284-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology</u></a><u>,</u> also showed that trackers didn’t help people move more, or get healthier.</span></p><p id="viewer-428pi"><span>Researchers at Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School challenged 800 workers with a target of 70,000 steps per week for 1 year. One group was given Fitbit Zips and another group Zips plus a cash bonus each week they hit their step goals. The control group got nothing except simple encouragement to walk more!</span></p><h3 id="viewer-3kq62"><span><span>Suggested Articles:</span></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-3umal"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-628nt"><p><span>📖 </span><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/are-e-books-the-perfect-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><strong>Are e-books the perfect alternative?</strong></u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-4vu6m"><p><strong>📱 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/smartphones-the-true-cost-of-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Smartphones: The True Cost of Upgrades</u></strong></a><strong> ♻️</strong></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-f7pln"><span>For the first 6 months, the money worked, but the Fitbits alone didn’t.

</span></p><h3 id="viewer-c7o16"><span>How to interpret the results?</span></h3><p id="viewer-fggdn"><span>So both these studies have come back with some pretty negative results, how did this happen?</span></p><p id="viewer-9ceo0"><span>Well according to the lead author on the Pittsburgh study, John Jakicic:</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-8s0cb"><span>“These technologies are focused on physical activity, like taking steps and getting your heart rate up, people would say, 'Oh, I exercised a lot today, now I can eat more.' And they might eat more than they otherwise would have.” </span></blockquote><p id="viewer-drb7s"><span>
This is understandable but surely there must be a reason so many people have invested in smart trackers other than our obsession with wearable tech?</span></p><p id="viewer-rnti"><span>
The point is that these devices will work, for <strong>some people. </strong>That is to say that too many people go and buy these devices hoping they'll motivate them to move more, but this just isn't the case; consumers misperceive what are in fact data trackers as motivational tools.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1dp63"><span>
“Fitness trackers are equivalent to a bathroom scale,” says Eric Finkelstein, lead author of the Lancet study. “They’re a measurement tool, not an intervention tool. They tell you something, but don’t give you a strategy for how to change it.”</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-4sqnd"><span><strong>Should you still go out and buy one?</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-fnpda"><span>As I said before, the usefulness of these devices varies from person to person, if you think that receiving a bunch of data about how much you’re moving on a regular basis will motivate to stay active then sure! But if you’re expecting the equivalent of a personal coach on your wrist then think again.</span></p><div id="viewer-ei9pb"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ldtr"><span>However, these companies are making efforts to improve the motivation aspect to their devices, like <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Apple’s activity rings</u></a>, or some devices allowing you to compare your data to your friends and family.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It recently surfaced in a story by <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/facebook-conversion-lift-measurement-issue-goes-undetected-for-12-months/">AdExchanger</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-latest-error-shakes-advertisers-confidence-11606346927">The Wall Street Journal</a> that Facebook had, for <strong><em>a year</em></strong>, been feeding incorrect data to advertisers paying to display adverts across Facebook's network using their lift conversion tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifically, the bug was caused by a data pipeline migration in August of last year that affected the way in which certain impressions were logged into Facebook’s conversion lift systems.</p>
<p>As a result, Facebook undercounted the number of conversions from people who were exposed to impressions on Facebook apps.</p>
<p>In other words, Facebook miscalculated the number of sales that came from people that saw an ad, which is a key ratio necessary to measure incrementality, because it’s used to calculate other metrics, including conversion lift percentage, which is the difference in conversions between the people who did and didn’t see ads during a test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In finding and fixing this issue, <em>they also surfaced two other bugs affecting data quality for a period of a few months</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During Facebook’s investigation into the original bug, it also came across and patched two additional, separate and, it says, “smaller” technical issues that affected conversion-based metrics for some lift tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows not long after LinkedIn fessed up to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linkedin-finds-measurement-errors-that-inflated-video-and-ad-metrics-11605228577">their own measurement fuckup</a> that saw 418,000 advertisers served incorrect data over a period of <strong><em>two years</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a blog post, the Microsoft Corp.-owned company said its engineering team found and fixed two measurement issues in its ad products, which led to overreporting of video views and ad impressions on sponsored-content campaigns. The bugs affected more than 418,000 advertisers over the course of more than two years, it said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently wrote about the <a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/marketers-addicted-bad-data">problem marketers have with bad data</a> and their inability to recognise and understand the data they're being presented from opaque third parties. Not necessarily through any real fault of their own, I hasten to add.</p>
<p>These most recent examples are particular pernicious. Marketers rely on data from Facebook, LinkedIn and similar to optimise campaigns and to assign limited budget. In both cases, incorrect data could have, and probably <em>did have</em>, a tangible effect on how marketers allocated their budget. This lead to Facebook and LinkedIn directly profiting from these fuck-ups.</p>
<p>I can't say this enough, but marketers without a healthy degree of scepticism are going to fall victim to this more and more frequently. If you let garbage data define your media strategy, you'll get garbage results.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

        <h3>RMS Does Not See the Future of Emacs
        </h3>
        
        </p>

    <p>I am an avid <a href="https://emacs.org/">Emacs</a> user. I’m using it right now to compose this post. I use it every single day for everything from work to school to personal notes. Most of my activity on GitHub comes from me tweaking little things in my configuration files. I now have an editor that perfectly fits my hands. Emacs is a big part of my life.</p>
<p>I’m afraid it’s dying.</p>
<p>Richard Stallman, one of the principle creators of Emacs and the head of the GNU Project, has made several choice in the past several months that I consider to be detrimental to the Emacs community and harmful for Emacs' further growth. RMS doesn’t seem to care that much about making Emacs appealing to new users, and I think this is a mistake. Emacs derives its strength from being uniquely customizable and extensible; the more people we get using Emacs, the more good extensions, packages, tutorials, etc. will be available for Emacs. Some of the growth-hostile things include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutting down suggestions for making Emacs start with a sensible set of defaults that would make it significantly easier for beginners to get started<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Purging links to the most popular (and most useful!) Emacs package repositories, Melpa and Marmalade, just because they <em>might</em> contain links to sites with non-free Javascript<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Ignoring community-driven development and exercising veto rule in cases where I personally think it was unwarranted<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>I can appreciate strong leadership; I think for creating most things, having a single leader drive the development of a product gives it focus and direction that otherwise might kill it off. (I think Python is a good example of this at work.) In this case with Emacs, however, I think RMS is badly out of touch and should focus on what we as a community can do to make Emacs more robust so that future generations of programmers will have a strong motivation to use Emacs—a desire to run free software motivates precious few people in their selection of their tools. We should make it more appealing for its features and performance as well.</p>
<p>Some areas where Emacs stands to improve are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong> The default Emacs theme looks awful. No computer user used to the comforts of macOS or Windows would want to go near that ugly beast. It should have a pretty-looking theme by default. One idea would be to make it so that a new user can select some pre-built themes.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> There are some exciting things happening with gccemacs on this front. I’m not running that right now, as compiling Emacs master on macOS is a little persnickety. Improving its rendering engine would help too. I recognize that that is a big undertaking, and unfortunately I have little to offer in this regard.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of contribution</strong> Why not host Emacs development on a self-hosted GitLab instance? Or use some other issue tracker? I understand that there are some advantages for mailing lists, but the set of programmers who are a.) familiar with that work flow, and b.) prefer it, is dwindling. An issue/PR-style flow makes a lot more sense for most developers, and I think it would go a long way to enriching community involvement in Emacs' core development.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just my thoughts, and will likely evolve over time. Unfortunately I cannot devote as much time as I would like to improving Emacs, though I do enjoy <a href="https://github.com/ashton314/gilded-select">learning to write packages</a> when I have the time.</p>
<p>Good luck, all you Emacs maintainers out there. You’re heroes.</p>

<p>New York City residents could make money by reporting illegally parked cars and then collecting part of the resulting fines under a proposal introduced last week.</p><p>The <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4699482&amp;GUID=0D2AA2FF-6328-4781-ABF1-8D789CB876A8&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=" target="_blank">bill</a>, sponsored by City Councilmembers Stephen Levin and Corey D. Johnson, would give parking whistleblowers 25% of any fines resulting from reports of cars that obstruct bike or bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks or fire hydrants located near schools. Not every car would be subject to the policy—only those parked illegally within a “radial distance” of 1,320 feet of a school building, entrance or exit.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal would also increase the fines for those cars, from $115 to $175. Cars with city-issued parking placards—typically given to police officers and other city employees—would not be exempt, which Johnson, the council speaker, said was designed to crack down on their unauthorized use.</p><p>“Placard abuse remains a scourge on our city streets despite repeated efforts to bring it to an end,” he wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCSpeakerCoJo/status/1329532664630693890" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>. “This new bill would give New Yorkers the power to end placard abuse through real-time crowdsourced reporting and appropriately harsh penalties.”</p><p>The proposed program would be modeled after an existing tool that allows residents to submit reports of <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/idling-citizens-air-complaint-program.page" target="_blank">idling cars</a> via an online portal. The parking initiative would use a similar, but separate, portal that would be overseen by the Department of Transportation, which would establish rules for the process, including the type of evidence required to follow up on a complaint. Cases that proceed would be heard before the city’s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.</p><p>Levin said the bill was not designed to increase revenue for the city—just to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p>“It’s not for all parking violations, just for the dangerous ones—parking in bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks and crosswalks,” he wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenLevin33/status/1331041372183392256" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>. “People die going into traffic avoiding cars doing this. Unfortunately, police don’t usually enforce.”</p><p>The proposal, referred to the council’s transportation committee, is the latest in a long line of initiatives meant to crack down on illegal use of parking placards. A three-strikes policy implemented by Mayor Bill de Blasio revoked <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/14/de-blasios-three-strikes-policy-nails-two-parking-placard-abusers/" target="_blank">just two permits</a> in 19 months, while a separate police department team issued 2,444 summonses for fraudulent use of a parking permit in its first year—the equivalent of “fewer than seven tickets a day across the entire city,” <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/08/11/the-nypds-non-existent-placard-crackdown-by-the-astonishingly-low-numbers/" target="_blank">Streetsblog reported</a>.<svg>

<h3 id="this-is-part-of-a-series">This is part of a series</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduction (you are here)</li>
<li><a href="https://rethinksecurity.io/posts/phase-one-of-appsec-engineering-awareness/">Awareness</a></li>
<li>Enablement (coming soon)</li>
<li>Enforcement (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for an AppSec team to collaborate effectively with development teams they should think in three phases: <a href="https://rethinksecurity.io/posts/phase-one-of-appsec-engineering-awareness/">Awareness</a>, Enablement, and Enforcement. This month I’ll be dedicating an article to each. The focus of these articles will be on the critically important area of application security, focused on the roles involved in building software: developers (DevOps), testers, and architects.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness</strong> training arms your team to understand how important security is and when to raise their hand for security support. Application security awareness can start with a series of talks, but the best awareness is hands on training. Getting the team to find, fix, or discuss vulnerabilities and threat scenarios is critical in giving them the awareness of when to think about security. The goals of this training isn’t to give the team the ability to find or fix vulnerabilities yet, it is to build a sense of impact and risk. A successful awareness program will provide experiences to draw from that will pop into their heads as they build or test. You want them to be able to recognize when to say “Wait, this has security implications. I’d better reach out to the security team!”</p>
<p><a href="https://rethinksecurity.io/posts/phase-one-of-appsec-engineering-awareness/">Read the complete article on Awareness here</a></p>
<p><strong>Enablement</strong> makes security easier for your team through automation and expert knowledge. Your security team needs to build the trust of the rest of the organization and make improvements to their processes by understanding their pain points and then solving them in ways that are easy to accept and adopt. This may mean instrumenting part of the Dev/Sec/Ops pipeline, building out better libraries, frameworks or defaults, building security unit tests, or to enable the testers to perform security testing alongside the rest of their test suite. The most important part of this phase is to help build software, not slow it down. The security team doesn’t exist to enforce its will on the rest of the company, but to enable them to meet their objectives. I call this “falling into a pit of success”. Make doing the secure thing easier than the insecure one.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcement</strong> is the backstop to security. This is defense in depth. Traditionally this is where most security programs start, but to be effective security teams need to win hearts and minds far, far earlier. In a mature model most security activities are performed and issues are found before the security team gets their hands on the software. Enforcement exists to double check procedures have been followed and to catch issues that slip through the cracks. This is also often where audit, compliance, regulatory checks can be performed.</p>
<p>Sometimes security teams will feel as if they are the last bastion fighting against the dev team who is ready to deploy insecure software to get features out. However, we are all in the business of building secure software and building trust with our customers. Every person at your company is trying to balance the many facets to quality software as best they can. Understanding how security fits into your overall process and how to build secure software without slowing development and deployment down is critical to the success of any company. A cooperative model will always be more effective than an adversarial one.</p>

<p>As of 2020, the percentage of white employees at Facebook is <a href="https://diversity.fb.com/read-report/">41%.</a> At Google, <a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866">51.7%</a>. At Microsoft, <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4aqv1">53.2%</a>. At Amazon, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/diversity-and-inclusion/our-workforce-data">34.7%</a>. At Apple, <a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/">50%</a>. <strong>The workforce of the big five tech companies is thus less than 50% white</strong>, if we weight each company equally.</p>
<p>Note that a population-weighted average across companies would bring the percentage white number down further given the size of Amazon. Moreover, while it’s true that Amazon’s workforce includes many blue collar employees,even if we restrict to white collar employees only (or just look at the other four big tech companies) the numbers cluster in the same range.</p>
<p>For most tech media corporations, we lack diversity reports, so we did two different kinds of analyses (subjective and algorithmic) on two different kinds of datasets (search-based and curated).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifically, we first collected a list of 982 tech journalists from Twitter, attempting to be comprehensive (details below). The subjective approach to estimating race and gender resulted in an figure of 80% white for this “search-based” dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>When we ran an alternative algorithmic approach to estimating race and gender on this same search-based dataset, we obtained an estimate of 77% white.</p></li>
<li><p>And when we re-ran the algorithmic approach on an independently curated dataset of tech journalists we obtained an estimate of 84% white.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The tightness of these different estimates for tech journalism should inspire some confidence in their accuracy. <strong>The overall estimate is that tech journalism is 77-84% white</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, tech journalism is considerably less racially diverse than tech. And when we repeat these analyses for gender, we find that tech and tech journalism are very similar.</p>
</div><div id="background-and-overview-of-the-methodology">
<h2>Background and overview of the methodology</h2>
<p>Oo Nwoye (<a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian">@OoTheNigerian</a>) wrote an initial <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">blog post</a> on this topic in early July 2020. The initial dataset focused on the diversity of editorial staff and attendees at tech-journalism conferences, but this approach had two limitations. First, conferences are subject to a variety of selection biases. Second, there are only so many people on editorial staff or in the tech-journalism conference circuit.</p>
<p>Here we pursue a different approach, using multiple methods to check the robustness of our results.</p>
<div id="two-different-datasets-search-based-and-curated">
<h3>Two different datasets: search-based and curated</h3>
<p>We use two different sampling methods to make sure our results are not sensitive to how the set of “tech journalists” is defined. This gave us two different datasets.</p>
<p>In the search-based method, we collected lists of individuals on Twitter whose bios indicate current or past work for any one of 13 major tech-journalism outlets (namely Verge, Gigaom, Cnet, Wired, Engadget, The Information, Recode, The Next Web, Venture Beat, TechRadar, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, and Motherboard). We added tech journalists from the New York Times with a slightly different method (detailed below) as most of the NYT isn’t devoted full time to just tech coverage. If you want to extend our analysis, this method can be generalized to the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, the Economist, and other general interest publications that include a significant amount of tech coverage.</p>
<p>In the curated method, we gathered a dataset of tech journalists by combining two publicly available, third-party-curated lists (<a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/96162061">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/53301954">2</a>) called “Tech Journalists.” We had no role in the curation of these lists, so if the results of our diversity analysis are similar when conducted on this sample as well, we should be more confident that our analyses accurately reflect the true state of tech journalism on Twitter.</p>
</div>
<div id="two-ways-of-estimating-race-and-gender">
<h3>Two ways of estimating race and gender</h3>
<p>Estimating race and gender can be tricky. An algorithmic method may fail to capture important nuances in how race and gender are socially constructed. A method based on subjective human judgment might err by being inconsistent about how race and gender are assigned. To deal with the limitations of each method, we estimate race and gender through <em>both</em> methods. If the results are similar, we should be relatively confident in their accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Subjective method</em>. Estimating race and gender through subjective human judgment was our first approach. We looked at each Twitter account and inferred the individual’s race and gender holistically, using their profile photo, name, and bio. In cases where either the gender or race was unclear using a subjective approach, we assigned an “NA” for the given variable. Given some controversy over the race of Arab and Persian people (the US census says “white” but many people have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/">contested</a> this), we sidestep the matter by assigning people of Arab and Persian descent “NA” for race. This affected only about 15 people, so neither classification would have a large effect on our key findings.</p>
<p><em>Algorithmic method</em>. As a second method, we leveraged data from the Census and the Social Security Administration to infer journalist’s race and gender from surnames and first names, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-using-twitter-data">
<h3>Note on using Twitter data</h3>
<p>Let’s discuss a few limitations of the approach of using Twitter-based samples to analyze tech journalism. First, it’s possible some tech journalists are not on Twitter. A second limitation is that a tech journalist may be on Twitter but not pulled up by the search algorithm. Third, we restricted our search to 13 tech publications and one general interest publication (the New York Times) that has significant tech coverage.</p>
<p>The main impact of these issues is that our sample will not capture every tech journalist on Twitter. Nonetheless, it should capture most of the writers at tech-focused publications, which means it should generalize.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-inferring-race-and-gender-from-names">
<h3>Note on inferring race and gender from names</h3>
<p>In estimating race from surnames, the most serious problem is due to the history of anti-black racism and slavery in the United States. Because of slavery in the United States, black people in America today frequently have European-origin last names (such as Williams or Washington). Therefore, inferring race from surnames will generally under-count black people. As you’ll see below, we take some extra steps to mitigate this problem (see comments inside the code snippets), but the results of any automated measurement method will always have some amount of error. A similar issue is present for gender estimation. We believe this problem is offset by using subjective assignment as an independent check.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-code">
<h3>Note on code</h3>
<p>This code in this study is research-grade. It works and we’ve double checked the numbers, but it has a fair bit of copy/paste when it comes to the graphs. To be clear, you should be able to reproduce everything from the code below, but if there’s interest in a cleaned up version we may provide it. Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/waQXLz6C8Jpc81EDA">this</a> if you’re interested.</p>
</div>
</div><div id="dataset-1-twitter-search-for-journalists-with-major-tech-outlets-in-their-bio">
<h2>Dataset 1: Twitter search for journalists with major tech outlets in their bio</h2>
<p>We used the R package <em>rtweet</em> to search for anyone on Twitter who mentions one of 12 journalism-related keywords (reporter, journalist, producer, designer, editor, writer, analyst, current, former, bylines, columnist, freelance) and one of 13 dedicated tech-journalism outlets in their bio (Verge, Gigaom, Cnet, Wired, Engadget, The Information, Recode, The Next Web, Venture Beat, TechRadar, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, and Motherboard). The Twitter API allows for up to 1,000 results per search.</p>
<p>Because the New York Times is not a dedicated tech publication, we used a different method. We first gathered names by searching for people on Twitter with “tech” and “nytimes” (the Twitter username of the NYT), and then we manually gathered the Twitter usernames of every author listed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology">the Technology section</a> in the month of July.</p>

<p><strong>A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and Unthinkable power to control evolution</strong>
by Jennifer Doudna and Samuel Steinberg is a book on gene-editing and a
technology called CRISPR.</p>
<p>The book is a personal narration of Jennifer Doudna as she explains the
development of CRISPR and it's discovery for use in gene editing.  Rather than a
review, this are notes while reading this book.  CRISPR is molecular structure
found in Bacteria, but now more popular term, commonly associated with a gene
editing technique.</p>
<p><em>Given the technical nature of this article, I must have used the text from the
sources only with slight modification for explanation. References should give
the materials I consulted to write this post. In you notice technical
inaccuracy, I aplogize, please point out, and I will correct it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Terms</strong></p>
<p>As I reader, I found reviewing biological terms helped me understand the
material better.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3cn83qir2ip3nso/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-50.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3cn83qir2ip3nso/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-50.png"></p><p>DNA, the language of life. Figure from <em>A Crack in Creation</em> book.</p>
</div>
<p>Human Body is made of <strong>cells</strong>, in-fact trillions of cells. Each of these cells
contain something called DNA. <strong>DNA</strong> is like recipe, just like a food recipe,
but for building and maintaining living organisms.</p>
<p>Cells use DNA to make proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of the body, they do
all the stuff we need to do to survive, from digesting food to making other
proteins.  Proteins are molecules made up of cells.</p>
<p>DNA is made up of a long combination of some very basic organic components
called Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. Human DNA consists of about 3
billion of these. The sequence of these determines the information available for
building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the
alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences.</p>
<p>In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like
structure called <strong>chromosomes</strong>. A <em>Chromosome</em> is a DNA containing structure.</p>
<p>RNA are like cousins of DNA, which has an oxygen atom with it. One type called
messager RNA, mRNA, act as carrier of information to different cells, carrying
information from DNA to those cells to produce proteins.</p>
<p>So far, in above definitions, we didn't emphasize on <em>heredity</em> , that is,
sending information from parent to child yet. As soon as we start talking about
<em>heredity</em>, we use the term, <strong>Genes</strong>.</p>
<p>A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Each chromosome of
human body has many genes.</p>
<p>If we take a single cell from human body, and find out the entire set of
<em>genetic information</em> in the chromosomes of that cell, we call that a
<strong>Genome</strong>. A Genome, from <strong>Gen</strong> e and Chromos <strong>ome</strong>, is the entire set of
<em>genetic</em> instructions found inside a cell.</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR in bacteria</strong></p>
<p>Single celled organisms like Bacteria were using a technique to fight off some
diseases.  The term CRISPR was given to an identified characteristic in
Bacterial DNA sequence, which was used to produce a protein called CAS-9, which
in turn, helped to kill the enemy virus.</p>
<p>CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and
is a family of DNA Sequences found in genomes of bacteria. CAS9 stands for
CRISPR associated protein 9.</p>
<p>The bacteria were found to capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use
them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the
bacteria to "remember" the viruses. If the viruses attack again, the bacteria
produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to target the viruses' DNA. The
bacteria then use Cas9 to cut the DNA apart and kill the virus.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/staumxmyll7ypty/Screenshot_2020-11-27-19-41.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/staumxmyll7ypty/Screenshot_2020-11-27-19-41.png"></p><p>CRISPR in Bacteria. Figure from <em>Crack in the Creation</em>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>CRISPR Shaping Human Genome</strong></p>
<p>The CRISPR-Cas9 system works similarly in the lab. Researchers create a small
piece of RNA with a short "guide" sequence that attaches (binds) to a specific
target sequence of DNA in a genome. The RNA also binds to the Cas9 enzyme. As in
bacteria, the modified RNA is used to recognize the DNA sequence, and the Cas9
enzyme cuts the DNA at the targeted location. Although Cas9 is the enzyme that
is used most often, other enzymes (for example Cpf1) can also be used. Once the
DNA is cut, researchers use the cell's own DNA repair machinery to add or delete
pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an
existing segment with a customized DNA sequence</p>
<p>When CRISPR was determind that it could be used in lab on living organisms, the
potential for shaping the genome unfolded.</p>
<p>First time ever, in over 100,000 years, we have ability to shape the <em>Homo
Sapien</em> evolution by mechanisms other than random mutation and natural
selection.</p>
<p>In humans, CRISPR can be used to do a precise repair and produce a normal
protein from a non-functional gene.</p>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zhew8671tk9dnx6/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-04.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zhew8671tk9dnx6/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-04.png"></p><p>CRISPR enables scientists to edit and <em>fix</em> single incorrect letters of DNA from
3.2 billion letters that comprise the human genome. It can also be used to
perform even more complicated edits to Human DNA.</p>
<p>A relatively straightforward DNA editing has transformed every genetic disease,
at-least the diseases for which we know the underlying mutation(s) into a
potentially treatable disease.</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR on Animals</strong></p>
<p>CRISPR has been used to create gene edited mouse wherein the genome of the
embroyo was edited and introduced back into womb to have an offspring with
the desirable characteristics embedded at time of birth.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/l0gxu7imj7v3pqa/Screenshot_2020-11-28-03-51.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/l0gxu7imj7v3pqa/Screenshot_2020-11-28-03-51.png"></p><p>Gene Edited Mouse. Figure from <em>A Crack in Creation</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>And we have used gene editing to create animals desirable characteristics</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7hdtn904xxas57q/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-01.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7hdtn904xxas57q/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-01.png"></p><p>Gene edited animals. Figure from <em>A crack in creation</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>This is currently used in practice. Like Recombinetics uses gene editing for
dehorning cattle, a safer method than physical dehorning using hot iron-rods.</p>

<p><strong>Pigs as Bio Reactors</strong></p>
<p>An important field of bio technology is regenerative medicine, desired by human
society who are fighting of some disease eithe naturally or have lost some
ability due an accident.</p>
<p>Many scientists see the pig itself as a source of medicine. It is seen
that we might be using pigs as bioreactors to produce valuable drugs like
therapeutic human proteins, which are too complex to synthesize from scratch and
can only be produced in living cells.</p>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lw2lleanrept8qf/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-07.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lw2lleanrept8qf/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-07.png"></p><p>Scientists have already been looking to
other transgenic animals to produce these biopharmaceutical drugs, or
farmaceuticals, as they’re colloquially called.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.revivicor.com/index.html">Revivicor</a> is a company that is using CRISPR to produce regenerative medicine,
following the process exactly outlined above. A workflow from their website
gives the details on how Pigs are used as Bio Reactors for regenerative
medicine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.revivicor.com/"><img alt="https://www.revivicor.com/images/RevivicorTechPoster-04-2010.jpg" src="https://www.revivicor.com/images/RevivicorTechPoster-04-2010.jpg"></a></p><hr>
<p><strong>Malaria Resistant Mosquitos</strong></p>
<p>The deadliest animal on earth, Mosquito can also be killed using CRISPR. The
idea seems to create malaria resistant mosquitoes using gene editing so that
the entire family is disabled from being a carriers of malaria.</p>

</div>
<p>Adult Homo sapiens are among the last animals to be treated with CRISPR, human
cell: have been subjected to more CRISPR gene editing than those of any other
organism.</p>
<p>Scientists have applied CRISPR in lung cells to correct the genetic mutation
that causes cystic fibrosis, in blood cells to correct the mutations that cause
sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, and in muscle cells to correct the
mutations that cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>Scientists have used CRISPR to edit and repair mutations in stem cells, which
can then be coaxed to transform into virtually any cell or tissue type in the
body.</p>
<p>Even as CRISPR continues to be useful, it's power as a technology and it's
potential misuse is a concern for everyone.</p>
<blockquote>
Whether we'll ever have the intellectual and moral capacity to
guide our own genetic destiny is an open question - one that has been in my
mind since I began to realize what CRISPR is capable of.
- Jennifer Doudna</blockquote>
<p>And Jennifer Doudna shares her stance as she says, that the nature will still be
our supreme master.</p>
<blockquote>
Any mutations that CRISPR might make—intentional or not—would almost certainly
pale in comparison to the genetic storm that rages inside each of us from
birth to death. As one writer put it, “Genetic editing would be a droplet in
the maelstrom of naturally churning genomes.” If CRISPR could eliminate a
disease-causing mutation in the embryo with high certainty and only a slight
risk of introducing a second off-target mutation elsewhere, the potential
payoffs might well outweigh the dangers.
- Jennifer Doudna</blockquote>

When I got on the job, I had to learn quickly. Before, I was focused on Tech. Now, I entered this new and fascinating world of customer service.</p>



<p>It became increasingly important to communicate effectively and find out where customers had problems to reduce support volume and overall customer effort.</p>



<p>This morning, while drinking my morning coffee, I read <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/helpu/high-effort-customer-experiences/">this article</a> on the Help Scout blog about Customer Effort. It brought back a lot of memories, as well as thoughts about service and support.</p>



<p>Here’s an interesting quote I absolutely can relate to:</p>



<blockquote><p>Have you ever had a customer who, by all accounts, seemed satisfied — but then canceled their subscription out of the blue? They may have responded positively to customer satisfaction surveys and accomplished their goals with your product, but that’s not always what matters when it comes to customer loyalty.</p></blockquote>



<p>Even if you’re not in the SaaS business, this still applies. The underlying question is this: How easy is it to work with you and your product or service?<br>How much effort do I need to invest in getting my work done with you? I’d like to talk about two strategies here.<br>While you should read the article for detailed and hands-on tips, here are two takeaways from my point of view.</p>



<p>Having a customer contact you should be as easy as possible. That means they can either easily find a contact email address on your website or use something like a live chat to get in touch.<br>In general, it is already an effort to get in touch with you, no matter if it’s email or live chat.<br>Therefore, make the conversation as effortless as possible. A great example from the blog:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Customer Carl</em>: I really need to upload this picture to your site, but I’m getting an error message.<br><em>Support Agent Hannah</em>: Ah yes, I can see that the image isn’t the right format. I’ve converted it to a JPG and attached it to this email so you can go ahead and get it uploaded now.</p></blockquote>



<p>The support agent found out what the problem is and went ahead to make it as easy as possible for the customer to move on. This approach eliminated uncertainty and reduced the actual effort for Carl. Carl only needs to paste in the picture and can continue working.</p>



<p>You can also use this approach for questions in emails like “I tried X, then saw this error. What am I doing wrong?”</p>



<p>It might be likely that you need additional information for the final diagnoses and recommended steps. Often, however, you might already be able to narrow down the possible causes and, therefore, solutions. Instead of just replying by asking for more context, you can directly go ahead and ask for context and provide possible solutions. For instance, you could say:</p>



<p>“Thank you for letting us know. Could you let me know this and that for some additional context?<br>Also, could you try to do this? Here is a link with the specific steps. This often occurs when X is not met.<br>If that doesn’t work, also consider trying Y and Z, with specific steps here and there.”</p>



<p>You make it easy for the customer to immediately try something and possibly help them solve the problem. If it doesn’t work, they can still get back to you with the additional context you asked for initially.</p>



<p>Another exciting thing in customer service:</p>



<p>While working as a support engineer at <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Travis CI</a>, I noticed many repeat questions in our support inbox, asking for specific maintenance commands or “my builds are not starting.”<br>I remember that one of the customers wrote something like this:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hey, so we had this problem again where the system consumed too much memory. Could you get me these commands again to clear the queues? Then I can add that to our internal run-book, so we can solve this on our own the next time this occurs.”</p></blockquote>



<p>I sent over the commands. But then, I realized, what if we could provide them with our own run-book that already has all of these commands and troubleshooting strategies, so they can use that as a template?<br>It would help them gain more independence when it comes to maintaining the system, and we’d have fewer support cases because specific strategies are already explained in the run-book.</p>



<p>We published the first version of our own operations manual not too long after. Indeed, the number of support requests asking for maintenance commands and citing common problems reduced significantly.</p>



<p>Now it is your turn. What can you do to reduce your customers’ effort working with you and your products or services?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7dbf04694dfeeec9985b2ebb27cc1faff153111b/75e93/assets/img/2020/m1/m1.jpg"></p><p>The excitement around Apple’s new M1 chip is <a href="https://www.singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">everywhere</a>. I bought a MacBook Air 16GB M1 to see how viable it is as main development machine - here’s an early report after a week of testing.</p><h2 id="xcode">Xcode</h2><p>Xcode runs FAST on the M1. Compiling the <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/">PSPDFKit PDF SDK</a> (debug, arm64) can almost compete with the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro Apple offers to date, with <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332052251712614405?s=21">8:49 min vs 7:31 min</a>. For comparison, my Hackintosh builds the same in less than 5 minutes.</p><p>One can’t overstate how impressive this is for a fan-less machine. Apple’s last experiment with fan-less MacBooks was the 12-inch version from 2017, which builds the same project in 41 minutes.</p><p>Our tests mostly ran just fine, although I found <a href="https://github.com/Aloshi/dukglue/pull/27">a bug specific to arm64</a> that we missed before, as we don’t run our tests on actual hardware on CI. Moving the Simulator to the same architecture as shipping devices will be beneficial and will help find more bugs.</p><p>Testing iOS below 14 is problematic. It seems <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332654247809257473?s=21">WebKit is crashing in a memory allocator</a>, throwing EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP, subcode=0x0) (Apple folks: FB8920323). Performance also seems really bad, with Xcode periodically <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332348616145563653?s=21">freezing</a> and the whole system becoming so <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332648748158246922?s=21">slow</a> that the mouse cursor gets choppy. Some Simulators even make problems on iOS 14, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1331628274783543297?s=21">such as the iPad Air (4th gen) which still emulates Intel</a>, so try to avoid that one.</p><p>We were extremely excited to be moving our CI to Mac Mini’s with M1 chip and are <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">waiting on MacStadium to release devices</a>, however it seems we will have to restrict tests to iOS 14 for that to work. With our current schedule, we plan to drop iOS 12 in Q3 2021 and iOS 13 in Q3 2022, so it will be a while until we can fully move to Apple Silicon.</p><p>There is a chance that Apple fixes these issues, however it’s not something to count on - given that this only affects older versions of iOS, the problem will at some point just “go away”.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> We’re working around the WebKit crashes for now via detecting Rosetta2 translation at runtime and simply skipping the tests where WebKit is used. This isn’t great, but luckily we’re not using WebKit a lot in our current project. <a href="https://gist.github.com/steipete/e15b1fabffc7da7d49c92e3fbd06971a">See my Gist for details</a>. Performance seems acceptable if you restrict parallel testing to at most two instances - else the system simply runs out of RAM and swapping is just really slow.</p><h2 id="docker">Docker</h2><p>We use Docker to automate our Website and load environments for our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/web/">Web and Server PDF SDKs</a>. Docker posted a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/">status update blog post</a> about the current state of things, admitting that it currently won’t work but that they’re <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142">working on it</a>. There are more <a href="https://finestructure.co/blog/2020/11/27/running-docker-on-apple-silicon-m1-follow-up">hacky ways to use Apple’s Hypervisor to run Docker container manually</a>, however this needs arm-based containers.</p><p>I expect a solution in Q1 2021 that runs arm-based containers. We’ll have to do some work to add arm-support (something already on the roadmap) so this is only a transitional issue.</p><h2 id="virtualization-and-windows">Virtualization and Windows</h2><p>To test our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/windows/">Windows PDF SDK</a>, most folks are using a VMware virtual machine with Windows 10 and Visual Studio. Currently none of the Mac virtualisation solutions support Apple Silicon, however both <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/11/parallels-confirms-apple-m1-support-amid-silence-from-other-virtualization-companies">VMware and Parallels</a> are working on it. I do not expect Virtualbox to be updated <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=98742">anytime soon</a>.</p><p>I expect that eventually we’ll be able to run ARM-based Windows with commercial tooling. Various <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/27/arm-windows-virtualization-m1-mac/">proof-of-concepts</a> already exist, and performance seems <a href="https://twitter.com/imbushuo/status/1332772957609922561?s=21">extremely promising</a>. Microsoft currently doesn’t sell ARM-based Windows, so getting a license will be interesting.</p><p>ARM-Windows can emulate x86 applications, and Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/it039s-official-x64-emulation-is-coming-to-windows-on-arm">x64 emulation</a>, which is already rolling out in Insider builds. In a few months, it should be possible to develop and test our Windows SDK with Visual Studio on M1 in reasonable performance.</p><p>Running older versions of macOS might be more problematic. We currently support macOS 10.14 with our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/pspdfkit-for-macos/">AppKit PDF SDK</a> and macOS 10.15 with the <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/pspdfkit-for-mac-catalyst/">Catalyst PDF SDK</a>, both OS releases that require testing. It remains to be seen if VMWare or Parallels include a complete x64 emulation layer. This would likely be really slow, so I wouldn’t count on it.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bbf100981357e4bc26c49722d31253daf76d293d/5b456/assets/img/2020/m1/memory.png" alt=""></p><p>Lastly, 16 GB RAM just isn’t a lot. When running parallel tests, the machine starts to heavily swap and performance really goes down the drain. This will be even more problematic with virtual machines running. Future machines will offer 32 GB options to alleviate this issue.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://gist.github.com/niw/e4313b9c14e968764a52375da41b4278#file-readme-md">How to run Windows 10 on ARM in Qemu with Hypervisor.framework patches on Apple Silicon Mac</a></p><h2 id="android-studio">Android Studio</h2><p>IntelliJ is working on porting the <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-2526">JetBrains Runtime</a> to Apple Silicon. The apps currently work through Rosetta 2, however building via Gradle is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jx4ntt/apple_macbook_air_m1_is_very_slow_in_gradle_builds/">extremely slow</a>. Gradle creates code at runtime, which seems a particular bad combination with the Rosetta 2 ahead-of-time translation logic.</p><p>I expect that most issues will be solved by Q1 2021, however it will likely be some more time until all Java versions run great on ARM. A lot of effort has been put into <a href="https://bell-sw.com/java/arm/performance/2019/01/15/the-status-of-java-on-arm/">loop unrolling and vectorisation</a>, not everything there is available on ARM just yet.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.azul.com/press_release/azul-announces-support-of-java-builds-of-openjdk-for-apple-silicon/">Azul offers macOS JDKs for arm64</a>, including for <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?os=macos&amp;architecture=arm-64-bit&amp;package=jdk">Java 8</a>.</p><h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2><p><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> currently works via Rosetta 2. Just prefix everything with <code>arch -x86_64</code> and it’ll just work. It is possible to install an additional (arm-based) version of Homebrew <a href="https://soffes.blog/homebrew-on-apple-silicon">under <code>/opt/homebrew</code></a> and mix setup, as <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857">more and more software</a> is adding support for arm.</p><p>This is not a problem currently (performance is good) and will eventually just work natively.</p><h2 id="applications">Applications</h2><p>Most applications just work, Rosetta is barely noticeable. Larger apps to take a longer initial performance hit (e.g. Microsoft Word takes <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-will-be-about-20-second-slower-initially-on-apple-silicon-rosetta-2/">around 20 seconds</a> until everything is translated), but then these binaries are cached and subsequent runs are fast.</p><p>There’s the occasional app that can’t be translated and fails on startup (e.g. <a href="https://beamer-app.com/download">Beamer</a> or the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_gh/drive/download/">Google Drive “Backup and Sync” client</a>), but this is rare. Some apps are confused about their place on disk and ask to be moved to the Applications directory, when really it’s just the translated binary that runs somewhere else. Most of these dialogs can be ignored. Some apps (e.g. Visual Studio Code) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1331884524934995968?s=21">block auto-updating</a> as the translated app location is readonly. However, in case of VS Code, the Insider build is already updated to ARM and just works.</p><p>Electron-based apps are slow if they run on Rosetta. It seems the highly optimized V8 JavaScript compiler blocks ahead-of-time translation. The latest stable version of Electron (Version 11) already <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/blog/apple-silicon">fully supports Apple Silicon</a>, and companies like Slack already updated their beta version to run natively.</p><p>Google just shipped <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3597749/google-releases-chrome-87-with-support-for-apple-silicon-macs.html">Chrome that runs on ARM</a>, however there’s still quite a performance gap between it and Apple Safari, which just <em>flies</em> on Apple Silicon.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The new M1 MacBooks are fast, beautiful and silent and the hype is absolutely justified. There’s still a lot to do on the software-front to catch up, and the bugs around older iOS Simulators are especially problematic.</p><p>All of that can be fixed in software and the whole industry is currently working on making the experience better, so by next year, when Apple updates the 16-inch MacBook Pro and releases the next generation of their M chip line, it should be absolutely possible to use a M1 Mac as main dev machine.</p><p>For the time being, the M1 will be my <del>travel</del> secondary laptop, and I’ll keep working on the 2,4 GHz 16-inch MacBook Pro with 32 GB RAM, which just is the faster machine. I’ll be much harder to accept the loud, always-on fans though, now that I know what soon will be possible.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s clear that we are living in a data-driven world. Our steady transition toward highly digitalized lives is making data a key asset in the modern economy. When we go online to make purchases, consume content, or share on social media, we are generating valuable data. Many of the largest tech companies are now operating on business models that depend on leveraging data. However none of that is possible without data integration. Data integration is the glue that makes it possible to convert raw data into a valuable asset.
Data integration can be defined as the process of acquiring data from diverse sources and transforming it into a data store or business application so that it can be used more effectively.</p><p>Countless business problems are caused by a lack of data integration. Fragmented data silos across companies or departments within companies make it necessary for users to rekey data or duplicate their efforts. Lack of unified data views can make decision making difficult. When individuals or departments have limited visibility to data, they often make decisions that fail to recognize the larger process, and they sub-optimize based on their limited view. Poor data integration causes a large amount of waste in business caused by inefficiencies and poor decision making.</p><p>Data integration techniques help to reduce these problems. Data integration techniques can be grouped into three categories. Business-to-Business (B2B) integration includes integrations that span across organizational boundaries so that trading partners can more efficiently execute business transactions. Application Integration is more specifically targeted at connecting separate business applications into an integrated workflow. Database Integration operates at the lowest level which is the data stores themselves. This category involves building pipelines that move raw data from data store to another. This is the type of integration used when building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions.</p><p>All three categories of integration are used quite frequently in the modern workplace and are extremely valuable to understand. Successful use of these techniques can make a significant impact on a businesses. Let’s take a look at the some of the ways data integration can improve business results.</p><h2 id="integrating-software">Integrating Software</h2><p>In a software-driven world, we all interact with a large number of software applications in the workplace. These applications are purchased with the goal of improving business results. A CRM system aspires to grow an organization’s sales. An ERP system aims to increase productivity and to accurately capture financial results. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of new software delivered with the software-as-a-service model (SaaS). These are usually web applications provided on a subscription basis. There are SaaS applications that target every conceivable niche in every industry. If you have a business problem, there is probably a SaaS application that was designed to solve it.</p><p>The challenge becomes what some call “SaaS sprawl”. An organization finds themselves using countless niche software tools for specific business problems. Just in the marketing department, there could be five or more software applications involved with marketing the organization’s products and managing leads. Those applications could include a customer relationship management app, social media marketing tools, a site content management system, and cloud email system, etc. Although it might be possible to achieve many of those functions on one big application like a cloud CRM, that tends not to happen in most organizations. Individual managers like to use the tools they are familiar with that are a good fit for their company’s size, culture and industry. Unfortunately this leads to complexity and data silos. Let’s say your marketing team has developed a blog to capture leads. Think of all the cloud software that could be involved in that process:</p><ul><li>WordPress to host the blog.</li><li>Spout Social to market the blog on social media.</li><li>Facebook Ads to drive paid traffic to the blog article.</li><li>Mailchimp to capture email list signups.</li><li>Google Analytics to track user activity on the blog and measure the effectiveness of the marketing channels</li><li>Unbounce to capture leads</li><li>Salesforce to manage and cultivate leads</li><li>Twilio to notify the sales team whenever a new lead is captured.</li></ul><p>I can stop there at eight applications but there are far more niche tools that could be introduced depending on the industry and size of the marketing department. Maybe salespeople want leads to schedule appointments with a tool like Calendly. There’s probably a separate cloud email system like Office 365. Perhaps marketing content like product sheets or presentations are stored in Dropbox. It goes on and on. Is it theoretically possible to do all of this on a big application like Salesforce or SAP? Maybe, but in reality, it almost never happens.</p><p>So there is no lack of great software capabilities out there that can add a great amount of value to organizations. Then what’s the problem? How do we make all these software apps work together? How do you get your customer emails from the Salesforce into Mailchimp? How do you get unsubscribes from Mailchimp back into Salesforce? How do you get Facebook ads to craft URLs in a way that allow Google Analytics to associate traffic or a conversion back to ad spend? How do you get leads from LeadPages into Salesforce? How can you assemble these eight different software capabilities into a seamless business process?</p><p>Data integration is the answer. Data integration techniques enable data flows between applications and across organizations. Without proper data integration, each business application operates in isolation.</p><h2 id="automation">Automation</h2><p>When a company’s business systems are isolated, human labor is required to key data into all these applications. This usually keying data into each app’s user interface or possibly some kind of Excel upload. In most companies, human labor is the most expensive business cost. Any kind of non-value adding human labor should be automated whenever possible. Data integration is often a key component to reducing manual labor. When you consider any kind of business process, it will usually consist of a data flow involving a sequence of data inputs and outputs.</p><p>Connecting these inputs and outputs is not always a simple task and can require various data integration techniques. The format and shape of the data for one app will be different from another. Data transformation techniques will need to be applied. Given most apps are now operating on the cloud, tools or programming will be needed to transmit the data to business partners or to call web services. Sometimes the data that comes out of one system has errors which need to be corrected before passing the data to the next system in the workflow. Data cleansing techniques will be necessary. Effective automation of business processes can sometimes require a lot of data engineering to get right. However, these types of projects can have a big impact on the business by reducing costs, improving quality and speeding execution time.</p><h2 id="leveraging-data">Leveraging Data</h2><p>Recently many companies have been investing in digitization strategies. Digitization involves leveraging software and data to become more competitive and profitable. In the midst of this trend you will often hear CEOs in industries like services, consumer products or manufacturing call their organizations “software companies”. But often the main value from a digitization strategy comes from data. Data is used to operate more efficiently, make better decisions, or even to create new products and services. Often machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are used to create even more value from the company’s data. Data becomes a key asset to cultivate and manage.</p><p>Most companies are trying to use data to make better decisions. As opposed to relying on the gut instinct of executives, data from internal and external data sources can help decision makers evaluate options objectively. Reports and dashboards are used to keep the management team updated on business performance. Often scorecards are used to evaluate individual employee and team performance. Metrics like financials, service response time, net promoter score, quality measurements, and so on are common to see on executive or individual contributor scorecards.</p><p>Often the data required to support digitization projects is spread across many different systems and databases. Data integration techniques are necessary to consolidate these disparate data sources into the shape and format these projects require. Perhaps a machine learning algorithm needs to combine sales data from the CRM with weather data from an 3rd party API. Or a dashboard that reports collection risk needs to combine sales data with the accounts receivable system. Data integration is a core practice that will almost always be necessary in these projects. Companies that are good at data integration will have a key competitive advantage in the today’s business environment.</p><p>Let’s say a manufacturer of farm equipment wants to use data collected by its tractors to help optimize crop yields. Perhaps sensors on their tractors can collect soil moisture measurements. The manufacturer could collect this data from all their tractors, combine it with external data sources like weather or commodities market prices. The end result might be recommendations to farmers about how to optimize their irrigation systems to optimize yields. Perhaps the data could even be sold to third parties like hedge funds to help them make investment decisions. This could become a new revenue source for the company that could supplement or some day even outperform the company’s original business model.</p><h2 id="diving-into-integration">Diving into Integration</h2><p>There are so many opportunities to reduce costs and improve sales using data integration techniques. Why aren’t more companies focusing on this? Although many tech …</p></div></div>

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my <a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/">Amiga</a>, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

    <p>
      Experiments in this page demonstrate that human perception of
      audio frequency is logarithmic. An interval is the change in
      frequency between two audio frequencies. An interval ratio
      is the ratio of the two frequencies. Human brain perceives two
      intervals (that is, the degree of jump from the first frequency to
      the second) to be equal if and only if their interval ratios are
      equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://susam.github.io/blob/lab/audio/exa">Experiment A</a> below may be better suited to
      musicians or someone with some form of musical training.
      <a href="https://susam.github.io/blob/lab/audio/exb">Experiment B</a> below may be better suited to
      someone who has no background in music.
    </p>

    <h2 id="exa"><a href="#exa">Experiment A</a></h2>

    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Play interval 1 first. It goes from 440&nbsp;Hz to
          493.88&nbsp;Hz. The difference between the frequencies is
          53.88&nbsp;Hz. The second frequency is 12% more than the
          first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then play interval 2. It goes from 880&nbsp;Hz to
          987.77&nbsp;Hz. The difference between them is 107.77&nbsp;Hz.
          The second frequency is again 12% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now play interval 3. It goes from 880&nbsp;Hz to
          933.88&nbsp;Hz. The difference between them is 53.88&nbsp;Hz.
          The second frequency is only 6% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 2 feel equal? That's because both have 12%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 3 feel unequal? That's because interval 1
          has 12% increase in frequency whereas interval 2 has only 6%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The interval used in 1 and 2 is one tone (two semitones). The
          interval used in 3 is less than a tone. This difference in the
          intervals may be too small for non-musicians to discern. Go to
          the <a href="#exb">next section</a> to see another experiment
          with larger intervals that might be easier for non-musicians.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Non-Musician-Friendly -->
    <h2 id="exb"><a href="#exb">Experiment B</a></h2>

    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Play interval 1 first. It goes from 400&nbsp;Hz to
          480&nbsp;Hz. The difference between the frequencies is
          80&nbsp;Hz. The second frequency is 20% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then play interval 2. It goes from 800&nbsp;Hz to 960&nbsp;Hz.
          The difference between them is 160&nbsp;Hz. The second
          frequency is again 20% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now play interval 3. It goes from 800&nbsp;Hz to 880&nbsp;Hz.
          The difference between them is 80&nbsp;Hz. The second
          frequency is only 10% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 2 feel equal? That's because both have 20%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 3 feel unequal? That's because interval 1
          has 20% increase in frequency whereas interval 2 has only 10%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the intervals sound unpleasant to you because the frequencies
          do not correspond to any valid notes or intervals in music, go
          to the <a href="#ex1">previous section</a> to see another
          experiment for musicians.
        </p>

  <h2>I want an offline encyclopedia and am extremely masochistic</h2>

<section id="main_content">


<p>I’m working on a project where I want to have an offline encyclopedia. It’s for training deep learning networks so it needs to be in plain text English. 
No markup, no special characters. Human readable without any interpreters, renderers, or parsers. I’ve got plenty of disk space, so that’s not a concern. 
Once I parse out all the Wikipedia articles I can get my hands on, I will create an index. Or I might index them into SOLR or something like that. Not sure yet.
I’m also going to implement it as a resource for a massive <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507">SQUAD repo</a>. I have uploaded a copy of the final result to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ltcmdrdata/plain-text-wikipedia-202011">Kaggle Datasets</a>. I’ve stashed the script in a <a href="https://github.com/daveshap/PlainTextWikipedia">dedicated repo on GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The first thing I should have learned is that Wikipedia is written in a demented Frankenstein language called WikeMedia Text. It’s a hybrid of HTML/XML and Markdown. 
It has no consistency and is the worst example of spaghetti code I’ve ever seen. I’m sure there are better implementations today, but I can see how and why it ended up the way it did.
For instance, you need to be able to create robust references and links, so the URL syntax is way jacked. It relies on a lot of procedural generation at display time.
Personally, if it were done again today, I think something like Jekyll would be way better. Instead of rendering again and again every time someone visits a page, render it once after each edit.
But that’s just me. So instead we’re left with this horrible hybrid language that should die in a fire.</p>

<p>Fine, it is what it is. I’m an expert automator, dammit, and if a machine can automatically render this nonsense, then I sure as hell can <strong>unrender it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-1---brute-force-regex">Attempt 1 - Brute Force Regex</h2>

<p>“Brute Force Regex” (BFR) is not a real thing. It’s just something I’ve been doing for years now in my automation habits. Usually, as a naive approach, I’ll try and do some 
search-and-replace jiggery pokery to just remove unwanted junk. Sometimes this is textual formatting, like brackets around tables or other HTML tags. 
So I ended up with the following function. Caution, it’s not pretty. This was just an experiment, and I wanted to share it so you would see what doesn’t work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>basic_replacements</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>replacements</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;lt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&lt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&gt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;quot;'</span><span>,</span><span>'"'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'''"</span><span>,</span><span>' = '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'{2,}"</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>r'\n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'r</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;ref.*?&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;/ref&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'http.*?\s'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'\s+'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>replacements</span><span>:</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>r</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I came up with this scheme because, at first glance, WikiMedia Text looked like a mixture of some basic HTML and some Markdown. 
I figured I could handle it with some basic regex replacements. This worked… to an extent. There were a few problems with it though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Couldn’t handle nested square brackets or curly brackets, and it turns out there are a lot of those</li>
  <li>Quickly became intractable when I encountered escaped unicode literals like <code>\u2013</code>. They are frigging everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wrote two more functions to try and tackle the bracketed stuff. These are things like links, citations, and pictures. Since I want a text-only Wikipedia, 
I really just needed to strip it all away.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remove_double_curly</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span> 
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>


<span>def</span> <span>remove_double_brackets</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>double_brackets</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>'\[\[.*?\]\]'</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>db</span> <span>in</span> <span>double_brackets</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>'|'</span> <span>in</span> <span>db</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'|'</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
            <span>else</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>'['</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions worked-ish. You might notice the carat <code>^</code> in the curly function. This told it to match anything except another open curly bracket. This forced it to find the
innermost nested curly brackets. Again, this mostly worked, but it failed a few times and I gave up trying to figure out why. The square brackets are a bit different, as
they tend not to be nested but the inner syntax could be several different things. I opted for the simplest possible way and even so, it missed a few things. No idea why.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-15---literal-evals">Attempt 1.5 - Literal Evals</h2>

<p>I suppose I should rewind and give some context. Wikipedia dump files are effing huge. Even with 32GB of RAM on my desktop, I was rapidly running out of memory just 
loading one chunk at a time. So that meant I had to read each file line by line. Like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>,</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
        <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>literal_eval</span><span>(</span><span>f'"""</span><span>{</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>"""'</span><span>)</span>  <span># this works... sometimes
</span>        <span>if</span> <span>'&lt;page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># new article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>'&lt;/page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># end of article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>+=</span> <span>line</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works great for just reading the thing one at a time. One consistency in the Wikipedia dumps is that every page starts and ends with <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/page&gt;</code> respectively.
This served as a great demarcation. So I tried to handle the unicode literals as they were coming in with <a href="https://www.kite.com/python/docs/ast.literal_eval">ast.literal_eval</a>. 
Spoiler: It worked. A little bit. This function frequently bombs out for various reasons.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2---existing-parsers">Attempt 2 - Existing Parsers</h2>

<p>I finally gave up on manually parsing WikiMedia Text and found some extant parsers. First up is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikitextparser/">wikitextparser</a> which, as of this writing, is actively maintained.
Second up was the simple <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> which got some of the stuff the first missed. These premade parsers are great in that they 
don’t require me to use any of my own brain power! They are, however, far slower than my regex replace functions. It can’t be avoided, though.</p>

<p>So now my output looks more like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4413617"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The Samajtantrik Sramik Front is a national trade union federation in Bangladesh. It is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Samajtantrik Sramik Front"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2618"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus (; also spelled Eacus; Ancient Greek: </span><span>\u</span><span>0391</span><span>\u</span><span>1f30</span><span>\u</span><span>03b1</span><span>\u</span><span>03ba</span><span>\u</span><span>03cc</span><span>\u</span><span>03c2 Aiakos or Aiacos) was a mythological king of the island of Aegina..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3201"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"[[File:Global_Temperature_And_Forces.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Observed temperature from NASA. vs the 1850</span><span>\u</span><span>20131900 average used by the IPCC as a pre- industrial baseline..

  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Attribution of recent climate change"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s much cleaner and moving in the right direction but I still have to figure out the literal eval reliably and a few square brackets are making it through as well. 
These premade parsers are far slower but one advantage of cleaning up Wikipedia articles is that they end up far smaller without the markup. If you just want the accumulated 
knowledge in plain text format, it ends up being a fraction of the size.</p>



<p>I can tolerate a few aberrations here and there but the perfectionist in me wants to do better. Anyways, here’s my script as it stands today:</p>

<p>It’s not the most elegant solution but for just over 100 lines of code, it will parse almost all of Wikipedia and save it to 40MB chunks of JSON.
Running this script looks like the following:</p>

<p>EmacsConf 2020 | Online Conference | <strong>November 28 and 29, 2020</strong><br>
<a href="https://emacsconf.org/i/emacsconf-logo1-256.png"><img src="https://emacsconf.org/i/emacsconf-logo1-256.png" width="256" height="256" alt="EmacsConf logo"></a><br>

<a href="https://emacsconf.org/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a></p>

<p>EmacsConf is the conference about the joy of Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and
memorizing key sequences.</p>

<p>EmacsConf 2020 was on November 28 (Sat) and November 29 (Sun),
2020 from 9am-5pm Toronto/EST time; equivalently, 6am-2pm PST,
2pm-10pm UTC, 3pm-11pm Zurich/CET.</p>

<p>It made sense to hold EmacsConf 2020 as a virtual (online) conference
again this year, especially now, given the current state of the world
with the ongoing global pandemic. We remain fully committed to
freedom, and we will continue using our infrastructure and streaming
setup consisting entirely of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, much like the
last EmacsConf. Check out the <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/schedule/"><strong>Schedule</strong></a> and
<a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/poster/"><strong>Poster</strong></a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Watching</h2>

<p>Over the next few weeks, we'll split up the bulk video recordings into
individual talks. We'll post the videos and links on the individual
talk pages, and we'll send an update to the
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss">emacsconf-discuss</a> mailing list. In the meantime,
please enjoy <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/talks/">last year's talks</a>.</p>

<h2>Participating</h2>

<p>For audience questions specifically, we experimented with using a
collaboratively-editable Etherpad as the primary means of collecting
audience questions. <a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/emacsconf-2020">https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/emacsconf-2020</a>
We also took questions from our IRC channel (<code>#emacsconf</code> on
<code>chat.freenode.net</code>), with volunteers adding questions from that
channel to the pad on behalf of folks who were not able to or prefer
not to use the web-based questions pad.</p>

<p>Come hang out with us in <code>#emacsconf</code> on <code>chat.freenode.net</code>.  You can
join the chat using <a href="ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/emacsconf">your favourite IRC client</a>, or by visiting
<a href="https://chat.emacsconf.org/">chat.emacsconf.org</a> in your web browser, a self-hosted instance
of <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a> free software web IRC client for EmacsConf.</p>

<p>To follow up after the conference, please check the <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/schedule/">schedule</a> for
the link to the individual talk page. Over the next few weeks, we'll
add notes from the pad, other resources, and followup contact
information from speakers.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>Be sure to subscribe to our mailing list
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss">emacsconf-discuss</a> for discussion and
announcements about the conference.</p>

<p>If you harbor a bit of angst over Facebook friend requests gone unanswered, a surprise “defriending” or being deserted by your Twitter followers, you’re not alone. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c228/e440fb12a64e3489a16362ec614475c5ccf5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You are feeling <strong>Cyberostracism</strong> which is called effects of Being Ignored Over the Internet.</a></p>



<p>Or, increasingly, how many&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;followers they have. This year, a third-party service launched Qwitter, which allows Twitter users to determine who’s stopped following them and which tweet may have turned them off.</p>



<p>Ostracism, the act of ignoring and exclusion, has been widely<br>documented as ubiquitous and powerful. Ostracism occurs across the life span. Young children use forms of ostracism on each other during supervised play, and adolescents, particularly girls, are likely to use ostracism in their conflicts. Most adults will at some point in their lives be targets and sources of ostracism (we use the terms “target” and “source” to refer to the individuals who are ostracized and who ostracize.</p>



<p>In a representative survey of over 2,000 Americans, 67% admitted to using “the silent treatment,” a punitive form of ostracism, on a loved one, whereas 75% indicated that they had been a target of the silent treatment by a loved one. </p>



<p>Experts say rejection on social networks can hurt worse than an in-person snub because people are usually more polite face-to-face than they are online.</p>



<p>“I think the thing that is often clearly worse online is when it’s relatively anonymous, and people use that as a cover and are more cruel than they would be otherwise,” said Jean Twenge, a San Diego State psychologist who has studied the way social networking affects personality development.</p>



<p>These data include Williams’ “cyberball” studies, which ask a participant to play a virtual ball-tossing game with two other icons. In one study group, the participant plays the game for the entire six minutes, but in the second group, he or she is included for only a fraction of that time and then ignored. The second group reports feelings of anger and lower levels of self-esteem.</p>



<p>Whether participants believe they’re playing with humans doesn’t appear to affect their feelings of rejection.. Even when people get rejected by the computer, they feel bad.</p>



<p>The study also affected the way how participants interacts online. Out of the 1,200 friends he has on&nbsp;Facebook, 400 of them he doesn’t really know, many of them being friends of friends.</p>



<p>“I thought about defriending them, but I didn’t want them to feel how I felt” during the “cyberball” game, said a participant.</p>



<p>Cecilia Sepp, a Washington, D.C.-area consultant, said she avoids the issue entirely by limiting her online network to about 100 friends.</p>



<p>“I don’t have a problem with defriending because I don’t accumulate [enough] to have a high number,” Sepp said.</p>



<p>“When I first heard that defriending was beginning on social networks, it was through a blog post by someone who was shocked that this person had defriended them because they didn’t understand why,” she said. “The person wanted to know had they done something, had they said something, should they ask, ‘What did [I] do?’ ” </p>

<p>Chen Wang, 2020.11.24</p>

<p>After a period of hard work, we can now run an Android “minimal system” on QEMU of RISC-V.</p>

<p>The following is a brief summary of the current work. Although the road ahead is still long, there is something to have a look.</p>

<h2 id="1-requirement-analysis">1. Requirement analysis</h2>

<p>The full name of our project is “AOSP for RISC-V”, and all the source code is currently opened on github: <a href="https://github.com/aosp-riscv">https://github.com/aosp-riscv</a>. The ultimate goal of our project is to port Android on RISC-V. Of course, this goal is huge.</p>

<p>But in the short term, we still have a small goal, which is described in one sentence: <code>based on the RISC-V platform, realize the kernel part of Android running on QEMU, and run the Android Shell</code>.</p>

<p>Based on the above objectives, the specific analysis is to realize a minimal Android system. The meaning of “minimal system” here is the so-called “bootable unix-style command line operating system”. In the traditional sense, a complete “minimal system” is described on the left side of the figure below. From bottom to top, the bottom is the hardware (note: hardware is not part of our “minimal system”). The first layer of software running on the hardware is the “Operating System Kernel”, and upon the OS kernel is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">“C library”</a>. Based on the C Library, we can build a minimal file system, which is essentially a bunch of command-line tools. These command-line tools must include at least a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">“init”</a>, which is used to start the basic login shell in cooperation with the kernel, and one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">“Shell”</a> is used to interact with users and call other tools and programs. With this “minimal system”, our big goal has a foundation.</p>

<p><img src="https://plctlab.github.io/aosp/diagrams/mini-system.png" alt="a minimal unix-style os"></p>

<p>Through the investigation of AOSP, I roughly summarized the work we need to achieve as follows:</p>

  <li>Hardware part: Here we first use QEMU for RISC-V to simulate.</li>
  <li>OS Kernel: The kernel of Android uses Linux, of course, it has some patches of its own.</li>
  <li>C Library: Android has its own C library, which is bionic. It differs from the GNU C library (glibc) in that it is designed for devices with low memory and processor capabilities and running on Linux. It is released under the BSD license, rather than using the GNU public license like glibc.</li>
  <li>Root filesystem: Android has its own complex file system organization. As the goal of our experiment, what we need is the most streamlined and smallest file system. There is no need to transplant the complete Android system over, so I chose toybox to implement our various kind of command line tool. Someone may ask why we don’t use the more famous busybox. The reason is still related to the software license. Busybox uses GPL, while toybox uses BSD, which is more in line with Android’s appetite. Therefore, toybox is included in the source tree of AOSP, but busybox is not. In addition, I need to mention, because the implementation of toybox is very simple, the shell that provided by toybox does not work properly. Fortunately, Android already has its own official Shell, which is mksh, so we use mksh directly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-introduction-to-porting-work">2. Introduction to porting work</h2>

<p>The above talked about what needs to be done in the overall porting work. In fact, there are still many details in the specific implementation. Since our final goal (to transplant AOSP as a whole to RISC-V) is far from being achieved, I will briefly sort out what I have achieved so far, just for memo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating platform (hardware): currently adopt QEMU temporarily.</li>
  <li>AOSP version: tag based on <code>android-10.0.0_r39</code>.</li>
  <li>Toolchain environment: building of AOSP has been completely migrated to LLVM/CLANG, but GNU tools are still used in linking. Since the prebuild tool chain that comes with AOSP does not support RISC-V, I have to build my own LLVM/Clang and GNU-tools.</li>
  <li>Kernel porting: the kernel version I used tag <code>android-5.4-stable</code> for andorid common repository plus tag <code>android11-release</code> for configs repository.</li>
  <li>The porting of the BIONIC library, as mentioned earlier, is based on the tag <code>android-10.0.0_r39</code> too. Considering the requirements in first phase, only the static library of libc is implemented, the dynamic library of libc is not implemented, neither for libm/libdl/libstdc++/linker till now (but I will handle them soon later). In other words, the following executable programs such as toybox and mksh are statically linked. libc is the most important part of bionic, and the composition is quite complex. The main components and the dependencies between them are briefly summarized in following diagram:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://plctlab.github.io/aosp/diagrams/bionic-libc.png" alt="bionic libc"></p>

<ul>
  <li>toybox: As mentioned earlier, it is based on tag <code>android-10.0.0_r39</code>, but with a lot of tailoring. Because the toybox in Android includes many Android-specific features, such as SELinux and encryption, etc. In order not to involve too much effort in current phase, I disabled these functions and only retain some basic common functions.</li>
  <li>mksh: The Shell looks relatively simple, just make sure there is no problem with the compilation.</li>
  <li>There is also a big work involved in the construction of the build system. I did not use the native Soong system that comes with AOSP, because in the pre-research process, I found that it is not easy to add a new ARCH from scrach in the existing AOSP build system (i.e. to use the traditional lunch + m). AOSP’s building system is too complicated and mature for existing ARCH that supported, but it is not friendly to latecomers. In order to reduce the risk and focus on the key areas in advance, I chose to use make and rewrite the makefiles for modules (bionic/toybox/mksh) that need to be ported. Of course, we still need to find a chance to move to AOSP Soong later, just let’s do it later.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-steps-to-make-this-minimal-system">3. Steps to make this minimal system</h2>

<p>After some work, the above small goal has been initially completed, and at least one of the “minimal Android systems” we defined above can be launched on QEMU. The related porting and modification have been opened on github. Allow me brief following steps and you are welcomed to have a try and test, submit PR, or directly participate in our AOSP porting work.</p>

<h3 id="31-environmental-preparation">3.1 Environmental preparation</h3>

<p>The experiment is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Release: 20.04
Codename: focal
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The software that needs to be installed in advance is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev \
                  gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc \
                  zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev git \
                  libglib2.0-dev libfdt-dev libpixman-1-dev \
                  libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then create a working directory <code>riscv64-linux</code>, the following operations are performed under this directory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir riscv64-linux
$ cd riscv64-linux
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="311-building-gnu-toolchain">3.1.1 Building GNU toolchain</h4>

<p>Download source code</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Enter the source directory:</p>



<p>Note that the main repository of clone above does not contain the contents of the sub-repositories, so you need to continue to update the sub-repositories. Note that the sub-repository of qemu is excluded first, because the complete download of qemu is too large; second, qemu is actually not needed for the toolchain compilation itself.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git rm qemu
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wait patiently for the sub-repository download to complete.</p>

<p>Note that due to I want to install the tools to <code>/opt/riscv64</code>, so sudo is required for make.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv64
$ sudo make linux -j $(nproc)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Export the installation path of the toolchain. You can also write to the <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:/opt/riscv64/bin"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Test whether the toolchain is installed successfully.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -v
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Output similar to the following shows that the toolchain is compiled and installed normally.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Using built-in specs.

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="312-build-llvmclang-tool-chain">3.1.2 Build LLVM/Clang tool chain</h4>

<p>Make sure to return to the working directory <code>riscv64-linux</code> first.</p>

<p>After updating Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to the latest state, the software requirements for building llvm/clang should have been supported by default. Other tools needed in the compilation process are basically available on Ubuntu. If something is missed, please install it yourself.</p>

<p>Download the source code of llvm. The official source code repository is at github: <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After downloading, enter the root directory of the source code repository and check out the corresponding version. I choose thhe official release version <code>10.0.1-final</code> and switch to the <code>10.x</code> branch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cd llvm-project/

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-ix="fade-in-blog-post" id="continue-reading" data-w-id="090c74fd-0c24-ef76-0192-8c569ddeea91"><div><div data-ix="hide-blog-content-block" id="read-post"><div><div><p>Rolling Venture Funds are a hot commodity of the moment in the venture investing world. Pioneered by <a href="https://angellist.com/" target="_blank">AngelList</a>, they are a new form of venture capital fund structure meant to empower first-time fund managers to turn their network and audience into a small recurring stream of committed capital that they can deploy into startups on an ongoing basis. We wanted to quickly breakdown the new structure and explain how rolling funds work and how they are different than traditional venture capital funds.</p><p>Typical VC funds typically have a 7-10 year lifecycle with the first 3-4 years dedicated as the funds “active phase”, which is essentially when the General Partners or GPs (people sourcing and vetting investment opportunities) are looking to deploy capital into new investment opportunities (companies they believe have growth opportunities ahead). Traditional VC funds have “committed” capital, meaning when you hear a fund announce a “$100M” fund, they aren’t actually holding the money. Limited Partners or LPs (pension funds, endowments, hedge funds, family offices and other accredited investors) commit to a certain amount of 💰 that they will make available to the General Partners over the life of the fund. When the GPs of the fund find an investment opportunity they agree on, they must bring it to their LPs and “call” or request the capital necessary to fill the investment be released.</p><p>Generally speaking, the fund deploys roughly 40-50% (not exact, and this number can vary from fund to fund but this generally holds) of its committed capital during its 4-year active period. The fund then goes dormant, meaning that for the next 3-6 years the GPs will not look to make investments in new companies, but rather support their existing investments and help them grow and scale. What about the remaining 50-60% (we left management fees out of this breakdown)? Well, that money is meant to be deployed over that 3-6 year timeframe to support existing investments (bridge round, emergency capital, etc.) and for the fund to exercise its pro-rata rights, which essentially allows them to buy shares in subsequent funding rounds to maintain the % of ownership the fund has. Whew, that was a mouth full, so how do Rolling Funds differ?</p><p>Rolling Funds (so far) are structured on a quarter-long lifecycle, that is it, the fund is “active” like the traditional fund for 90 days. But don’t fret if it sounds like this is a painfully short lifetime. Rolling Funds are subscribed to by LPs on a subscription basis. What does that mean, each quarter the LPs commits to a certain 💰 amount and on the first day of that quarter puts their commitment into the fund along with all the other LPs and the fund is now active and goes to work. Unlike the Traditional Fund, the Rolling Fund will look to deploy 100% of their held capital(meaning the fund holds the $$ that was committed for the quarter by the LPs) in that 90 day “active” window. Once the quarter ends the fund closes and becomes “dormant” like the traditional VC fund.</p><p>The major difference is on the first day of the next quarter, the LPs (if they choose to continue subscribing) send in their quarterly commitment, and a new (legally separate) fund is created with fresh capital and the same 90-day journey to deploy their “held” capital begins again. If during a quarter, the fund does not deploy all the held capital that is raised, those funds roll over into the next quarter and are combined with the fresh capital from the LPs subscription in the new quarter’s fund. Without having to make capital “calls” the goal of these Rolling Funds is to empower the GPs to move quickly and make investments in startups without both parties needed to wait for LPs to get onboard. With fresh capital each quarter, Rolling Funds will be in a constant state of new deal-finding which is a positive for founders looking for capital. One thing that is yet to be seen is how Rolling Funds will a) support existing investments that require additional capital, or b) when the opportunity to exercise pro-rata rights comes into play.</p><p>Given that these Rolling Funds don’t have a built-in “reserve” pool like a Traditional Fund could GPs work with their LPs to coordinate quarter to quarter to adjust the size of their “subscription” to the fund in the event that a quarter arises when an investment from a previous fund requires additional capital and/or the opportunity to excise pro-rata rights. Obviously, this will require the GP and their LPs to be aligned on the opportunity but it does present an interesting opportunity to increase capital in a given quarter to maximize a stake in a subsequent funding round.</p><p>Sorry for this post getting a little longer than our usual but we wanted to really dive into the function of both of these fund structures. Long story short, Rolling Funds will more consistently be active with fresh capital whereas towards the end of a Traditional Funds “active” period, they might not have as much capital to deploy in as many deals until they raise another fund. We hope this is a helpful resource so you can understand the mechanics of both these structures and as a founder seeking funding, you can leverage that into aligning your startup with the right type of venture partner.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Developing a solution with machine learning is equal parts science and software engineering. The science of it is important, certainly, but your success will be equally dependant, if not more, on how you engineer your solution. Given the abundance of libraries that implement state-of-the-art algorithms for easy consumption and the data (and pre-trained models) to go with them, your ability to engineer your code well is the critical component for your success.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between two somewhat comparable data scientists, the one with better software engineering skills is more likely to succeed in a machine learning project than the one with better machine learning skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasons are twofold. First, the barrier to entry to build effective models is getting lower as many high-level libraries make it increasingly easier to solve a wide variety of problems in machine learning and deep learning. State-of-the-art results become available (as pre-trained models) in a matter of weeks after publication. There is always a tutorial around the corner showing you how to tackle your ml/dl problems with freely available tools.</p>

<p>Secondly, the data science culture is a mess, leading to a focus on model performance rather than real-life performance (which can be measured only after deployment). For data scientists, the impetus is more on getting the experiments right, quickly; whatever it takes to achieve that! But the value from data science/machine learning projects comes from their deployment, not modeling experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A more effective data scientist is the one who deploys more often, not the one with better model scores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The culture around this is changing though, and we hope to be a part of that change.</p>



<p>In this issue, we focus on our perception of the core reasons coming from working with and educating a lot of data scientists over the years.</p>

<p>Primarily, we think the problem arises from how the <strong>Cult of Kaggle</strong> (not in the way you think) promoted a habit of <strong>State Mismanagement</strong>, which results in <strong>Poorly abstracted codebases</strong> hurting data science projects.</p>



<p>Kaggle is a competition platform for machine learning and deep learning, and a lot of people complain that Kaggle is not real data science. That it sets up wrong expectations with its super-clean datasets neatly divided into train/test-sets, freeing the data scientist to focus only on the modeling problem and not have to worry about data issues.</p>

<p>While this is a valid criticism, we believe that there is a place and utility for such a platform. Given the fantastic community that has come up around Kaggle, it is now one of the most popular platforms for new (and old) data scientists to hone their craft.</p>

<p>The problem is the outsized role Kaggle plays in the education of data scientists. Given a new problem, most will try to get to those train/test-sets (and possibly a validation-set thrown in) and try to get a model that “works” in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization">empirical risk management</a> sense (on the test-set, of course).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For data scientists, the impetus is more on getting the experiments right, quickly; whatever it takes to achieve that! But the value from data science/machine learning projects comes from their deployment, not modelling experiments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This results in code that has bad abstractions. This code is usually propped up with all sorts of hacky engineering practices and put into production.</p>

<p>But if we have to put our finger on one bad abstraction that is pervasive in the data science (engineering) universe and responsible for much of the bad code, it will be state mismanagement.</p>



<p>DataFrames are one of the most ubiquitous and useful data structures, no matter what stack you are using, and they are also very useful to see if a codebase is likely to be bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If most of the functions in your codebase accept dataframes as input and return dataframes as output, you are likely not modelling the entities correctly and writing hacky code to patch things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-state-mismanagement">
What is state mismanagement?</h2>

<p>If you are coming from a traditional programming background, having done webapps or backends or any of the myriad things we do when we code, you’ll be used to creating some kind of abstraction to model the entities involved in your code. A customer, a purchase, a geographic location - any of these could be an entity of interest given the problem we have.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, you may have created classes to represent and model the state/behaviour of those entities. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">FP</a>, you may have focussed more on the state and the transitions those entities go through.</p>

<p>By <strong>state mismanagement</strong>, we refer to the situation when we don’t create these abstractions.</p>

<h2 id="why-state-management-is-important">
Why state management is important?</h2>

<p>These abstractions are very useful. We can write tests against them. We can use them to debug our code. We can persist them and inspect them later when something goes wrong. These abstractions also make code readable - we can follow the state and transitions of entities to understand what is happening. We can also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type of these abstractions</a> to debug/reason about our code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">if it is possible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="state-mismanagement-with-dataframes">
State mismanagement with DataFrames</h2>

<p>DataFrames list all observations of an experiment as rows and attributes of those observations as columns. They are similar to the tables in databases we are used to, but most dataframes in a data science project will typically combine many tables (each table typically represents an entity) into a single object (which will represent/hide states of many entities together).</p>

<p>When we don’t explicitly model different entities, our ability to reason about and debug/inspect them gets diminished significantly. We can’t write tests against functions that do things with those entities and their states. Most of our functions will accept dataframes as input and return dataframes as output, and will typically be in violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID principle</a>.</p>

<p>There are, of course, situations where dataframes are the correct solution. But someone not used to thinking about hidden entities and their states may not use them optimally.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The habit of including the states of many entities together in a single dataframe is the most prevalent reason for bad code that we have seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-practices-data-scientists">we talk about the poor standard of software engineering</a> in data science, we talk a lot about peripheral issues, but incorrect and <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b">leaky abstractions</a> are the main reason why most of the codebase we have seen suck. If you don’t even model your data adequately, how do you become <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/#1-become-one-with-the-data">one with the data</a>?</p>

<p>Models doing well in training and poorly in production, whether due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift">drift</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/araffin2/status/1329382226421837825">underspecification</a>, is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03395">real problem</a>. Without the necessary abstractions in place, it becomes very difficult to monitor, detect, and debug issues when they arise.</p>

<p>When we say poor abstractions result in poor code, lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a>-ness is mostly what we mean. A lot of the hacky software engineering practices we have seen in the wild arise as a consequence.</p>

<h2 id="consequences">
Consequences</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Deploying models</strong>: The pattern for consuming data in production is different compared to training. Abstractions created to explore/test/validate data in training can be mostly reused in deployment, and the lack of them hurts greatly.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Writing tests</strong>: It is hard to write meaningful tests if models (datastructures) for the entities in data are not available. This is why we are not seeing more tests in ML even though everyone is talking about them.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Monitoring models</strong>: So your credit default model is starting to perform poorly. Is this across the board, or only for a certain segment for certain entities (geocode, user-acquisition-channel cohort, or month)? Hard to answer this quickly in real-time while your deployed models are falling apart (and losing money) if you have not spent the time and effort to model the data and set up appropriate tests/monitoring.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Reproducibility</strong>: Reproducibility can come in many forms. You may be unable to reproduce the older models during monthly updates (data and hyperparameter versioning is another issue entirely), or the same deep learning-based model may produce different embeddings in a cpu-based deployment server when moved from a gpu-based training server. Without correct abstractions to debug with, you’ll be left wondering what is going wrong.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Commenting and reading code</strong>: Poorly written code with a lot of dataframe needs a lot of documentation, and anyone who has worked in a live codebase knows that good comment coverage is a moving goalpost (moving as the code changes).</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: If you are working with a Python stack, type-annotation is your friend. If you have to use a lot of <em>any</em> or <em>DataFrame</em> types, you are probably doing it wrong. In a correctly architected codebase, type-annotation can completely replace all forms of commenting and still make reading the codebase a breeze.)</p>



<p>As @seanjtaylor said, <em>there are no hard problems, only slow iterations</em>.</p>

<p>If you have an existing codebase that you think suffers from the issues we outline, start by refactoring small chunks of it (larger chunks will mean slower iterations and you’ll learn slower). If you are starting a new codebase, you can identify and model your entities and <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">be one with your data</a> before you start modeling.</p>

<p>And if you already kaggle, don’t stop. Just recognize that the things in Kaggle that give you dopamine hits should not be the same things that give you dopamine hits when you work on a production system. Hack that dopamine!</p>

      <p>Trying to figure out the starting point when you're beginning your privacy reboot is often the hardest part. You jump online to start your research, punching in "how to increase your privacy" into Google. After 30 minutes of reading an assortment of articles and comments on forums, you end up with more questions than when you started. &nbsp;</p><p>Who do I trust? Who is right? Is there more than one way to do this? Which is better? Why do I need to do this? How is this different than what I'm doing? &nbsp;I've never heard of any of these things, what are they?</p><p>After spending some time considering what someones first step should be, web browsers turned out to make the most sense. Changing your browser requires no money, no specific platform, no technical know how, little set up time, and minimal impact on day to day habits. Things like <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/threat-modeling">figuring out your threat model</a> don't come into play because this is something everyone needs to do at every level.</p><p>What you'll find here is a discussion surrounding 8 specific web browsers, search engines, add-ons, why you should care about which one you use, and suitable options.</p><hr><p>As of October 2020, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202010-202010-bar">Google Chrome is used by roughly 7 out of 10 internet users</a>. Speed, design, branding, and familiarity are a handful of reasons why so many people use Chrome on a day to day basis. But, it all comes at the expense of your data. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/whitepaper.html">here's a handful</a> of things <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/#privacy-practices-of-apps">Chrome collects.</a></p><ul><li>Chrome sends your original search query, the suggestion you selected, and the position of the suggestion back to Google</li><li>If you've chosen to sync your Chrome history, and if Google is your default search engine, the URL of the page you’re viewing is sent to Google</li><li>Chrome will send a [location] request to google.com each time you start the browser</li><li>Chrome uses your IP address to identify your country or region.</li><li>Desktop versions of Chrome can provide smarter spell-checking by sending text you type into the browser to Google's servers [...]. If this feature is enabled, Chrome sends the entire contents of text fields as you type in them to Google, along with the browser’s default language.</li><li>When you search using the address bar in Chrome, the characters you type (even if you haven’t hit "enter" yet) are sent to your default search engine.</li><li>When you can’t connect to a web page, you can get suggestions for alternative pages similar to the one you're trying to reach. In order to offer you suggestions, Chrome sends Google the URL of the page you're trying to reach.</li><li>Chrome sends Google limited, anonymous information about the web forms that you encounter or submit while Autofill or password management is enabled, including a hashed URL of the web page and details of the form's structure</li></ul><p>To summarize, Chrome can collect your searches, what you typed in the search bar even if you didn't complete the search, the URL of the page your viewing, your location, anything you type into the browser, the URL of pages you tried to go to but didn't load, and data around your web forms used with your auto fill. And remember, this list isn't comprehensive and any/all of this information is merged together with all of the other data Google has in your profile. <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/google-timeline">It isn't exactly like Google has a clean record when it comes to data abuse.</a></p><p>Thankfully, Chrome isn't the only choice available. &nbsp;Costing nothing more than about 15 minutes of your time, installing a new browser and going through the initial setup and settings is the first step to regaining an enormous amount of control over your digital privacy. </p><h2 id="so-which-one">So, which one?</h2><p>The browser market is nothing short of crowded with a mixture of old guards and up and comers. &nbsp;Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Brave, Tor, Chromium, Ungoogled Chromium, IceCat, Waterfox, Iridium, Pale Moon, Vivaldi, Epic, and more are all available and all vying for your attention.</p><p>With so many choices, it's tough to know what the differences are and which options actually respect your privacy. While we aren't going to cover every browser on the market, we're going to talk about 8 of the most commonly discussed browsers on the web.</p><p><em>Side note: this list is in alphabetical order and is not listed "best" to "worst"</em></p><hr><h3 id="brave"><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a></h3><p>Brave launched January 2016 as a browser that had a focus on privacy and ethical advertising. &nbsp;The first couple years of its life were spent as an Electron fork but eventually migrated to Google's open source project, Chromium, in 2019.</p><p>Over the years since its inception, Brave has added or enhanced multiple features to reinforce their commitment to privacy, such as better adblocking algorithms for their Shields feature, enhanced fingerprinting protection, and <a href="https://brave.com/tor-tabs-beta/">integrating Tor into their browser when using private tabs and windows.</a></p><p>But, it wasn't long before cracks began to show. <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/brave">Brave has been saddled with controversy after controversy after controversy</a> as the years went on and has lost much of its luster with the privacy community because of this. </p><p>If you're looking for a Chromium based browser, Brave is a decent option after adjusting a few settings but it's no longer respected among the community and comes with multiple asterisks.</p><h3 id="firefox"><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/">Firefox</a></h3><p>Thanks to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/firefox-data-privacy-promise/">Mozilla's commitment to protecting its users</a>, Firefox is often paraded as the best browser for privacy. It's open source, managed by the non-profit <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Foundation</a>, and is at the core of most privacy-focused browsers, such as Tor. Over the years, Firefox has led the charge with implementing privacy first features since they aren't reliant on data collection to stay in business.</p><p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/10/23/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection/">Enhanced tracking protection</a> to help block trackers by default, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2020/06/18/introducing-firefox-private-network-vpns-official-product-the-mozilla-vpn/">partnering with one of the most respected VPNs</a> in the community (<a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a>) to strengthen your privacy when browsing, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/firefox-59-will-add-a-new-privacy-feature-that-strips-sensitive-data-from-urls/">stripping sensitive information from URLs</a>, enabling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/02/firefox-turns-encrypted-dns-on-by-default-to-thwart-snooping-isps/">encrypted DNS by default to prevent snooping</a>, and an <a href="https://privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config">extensive configuration page</a> to further make granular changes are just a handful of features Mozilla has added over the years to guard your privacy. And while some other browsers treat mobile users as second class citizens, if they even serve them at all, Mozilla has been actively working to make sure you're covered not only on the big screen, but on the go as well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Focus">Firefox Focus</a>.</p><p>However, that's not to say that Firefox hasn't had its fair share of controversy and blunders. In 2014, Mozilla launched a new feature called <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">Directory Tiles</a>, which later turned into <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2015/05/21/providing-a-valuable-platform-for-advertisers-content-publishers-and-users/">Suggested Tiles</a>, that put ads and sponsored content directly into the Speed Dial. Shortly after, they partnered with Cliqz to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-tests-cliqz-engine-which-slurps-user-browsing-data/">bundle an add-on that sent your browsing activity back to their servers</a> and a few months after that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/16/16784628/mozilla-mr-robot-arg-plugin-firefox-looking-glass">they force installed an add-on without user interaction or permission</a> related to a TV show.</p><p>Even with the handful of questionable decisions, you'll be hard pressed to find a more private way to browse the web for every day use after flipping a few settings.</p><h3 id="iridium"><a href="https://iridiumbrowser.de/">Iridium</a></h3><p>Per Iridium's GitHub</p><blockquote>Iridium is an open modification of the Chromium code base, with privacy being enhanced in several key areas. Automatic transmission of partial queries, keywords, metrics to central services is inhibited and only occurs with consent.</blockquote><p>Iridium is an <a href="https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser">open source browser</a> based on Chromium but <a href="https://github.com/iridium-browser/tracker/wiki/Differences-between-Iridium-and-Chromium#privacy-enhancements">contains a slew of privacy enhancements turned on by default.</a> This does mean some things don't work, such as <a href="https://iridiumbrowser.de/faq">signing into your Google account and syncing data</a> like you can with Chrome/Chromium, since that would defeat the entire purpose.</p><p>Extensions work just like like they do in Chrome and the general style has a similar feel as well. The only true downside to Iridium is that it can lag behind in updates on certain platforms, sometimes for months. This could be a potential security issue as new vulnerabilities are constantly being patched but most updates are relatively minor.</p><p>If you want an overall solid Chromium browser, Iridium is a great choice.</p><h3 id="opera"><a href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></h3><p>When we're talking about old guards, Opera is sitting at the head of the table. Initially released 25 years ago in 1995, it's one of the oldest browsers still actively developed today. Opera has always been a part of the conversation but, for one reason or another, it's never truly been a first pick choice among users. </p><p>Opera started its life a bit different compared to what you find today. For the first 10 years of its life, Opera was paid commercial software and had its own rendering engine, Presto - which was dropped in 2013 for Chromium. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/opera-renegotiates-its-1-2b-sale-down-to-600m-for-browser-privacy-apps-chinese-jv/">In November 2016, the original Norwegian owner sold his stake in Opera Software company to a Chinese consortium named Golden Brick Capital Private Equity Fund I Limited Partnership for $600 million.</a> After word spread that a Chinese group took over Opera (a proprietary browser), concerns sprouted and trust was broken. </p><p>There was already a downward trend in active users at the time and the idea with the sell off was to, beyond getting a pay out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/25/opera-ceo-sale-to-chinese-consortium-wasnt-our-decision/">boost the number of users using the software and grow the ecosystem.</a></p><blockquote>“They have products we don’t have — and they have 500 million users in China, where we are not strong,” Boilesen said.</blockquote><p>In 2016, a <a href="https://www.opera.com/features/free-vpn">built in VPN</a> was released. &nbsp;Concerns rose as it 1) <a href="https://www.opera.com/features/free-vpn"></a><a href="https://gist.github.com/spaze/558b7c4cd81afa7c857381254ae7bd10">turned out to be a proxy and not really a VPN</a> and 2) this free "VPN" was released only a couple months before they were bought out by the Chinese consortium, which lead to worries about user data being funneled to Chinese servers.</p><p>Opera may have helped shape the browser landscape but they have no place in this discussion. There are simply too many asterisks to put this browser anywhere near a recommended section for privacy conscious users and should not be used. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="tor"><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a></h3><p>When it comes to privacy, there's currently nothing as accessible and private as Tor. &nbsp;<a href="https://media.torproject.org/video/2015-03-animation/HQ/Tor_Animation_en.mp4">Here's a quick 2 minute video</a> explaining what Tor is and how it's able to achieve such a high level of privacy.</p><p>In short, there's two main ways Tor jumps ahead of other browsers for privacy. First, they automatically make everyone using Tor look the same. When you look exactly like 485,028 other Tor users, you being identified is next to impossible. And second, …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Widely used data store solution for orchestrators has seen </em><em>200 distinct contributors in the past 12 months</em></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – November 24, 2020 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of etcd. To move from the maturity level of <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">incubation to graduation</a> etcd has demonstrated growing adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p>



<p><a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> is a distributed, reliable key-value store and provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. Applications of any complexity, from a simple web app to Kubernetes, can read data from and write data into etcd. The project was created at CoreOS in 2013 and joined CNCF in December 2018 as an incubating project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The etcd project is a key component inside Kubernetes along with many other projects that depend on etcd for reliable distributed data storage,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “We remain impressed by the milestones that etcd continues to reach in scale and mature handling of its recent security audit, we look forward to cultivating its community as a graduated project.”</p>



<p>etcd is used in production by <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">many companies</a>, including Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Cisco, EMC, Google, Huawei, IBM, Red Hat, Uber, Verizon, and more, and projects including Kubernetes, CoreDNS, M3, Rook, and TiKV.</p>



<p>“Having etcd as our meta-store in Placement Driver and our inspiration for Raft implementation in production has proven to be a great choice for TiKV and TiDB, ensuring data consistency and high availability across TiDB clusters,” said Ed Huang, co-founder and CTO at PingCAP. “We are proud and glad to be part of its graduation journey, and we’d love to be involved in its ecosystem development more in the future.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/MAINTAINERS">maintainer</a> team currently consists of 10 members, with a healthy distribution of corporations represented, including Alibaba, Amazon, Cockroach Labs, Google Cloud, IBM, Indeed, and Red Hat. Three new maintainers have been added since etcd became an incubating project. Over the last 12 months, 200 distinct contributors have authored pull requests.</p>



<p>“After seven years of development, etcd has reached maturity and become the cornerstone of many distributed systems. The most important decision for its success was joining the CNCF community and growing its maintainers across many organizations,” said Xiang, etcd maintainer, CNCT TOC member, and engineering director at Alibaba Cloud. “We are excited to see its graduation at CNCF. etcd is the centerpiece powering the container service and many other critical services at Alibaba Cloud. We are looking forward to improving its stability, reliability, and performance with the community in the future.”</p>



<p>A third-party <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/08/05/etcd-security-audit/">security audit</a> sponsored by CNCF was performed in July 2020 for the latest major release of etcd, v3.4 by Trail of Bits. According to the <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">report</a>, the etcd codebase represents a mature and heavily adopted product, and there were no significant issues found in the core components of etcd. One high severity issue was found in the etcd gateway, which the team addressed with fixes and backported into etcd supported releases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project also went through Jepsen testing, which analyzes open source distributed systems to check if they fulfill their consistency guarantees, in January 2020. The <a href="https://etcd.io/blog/jepsen-343-results/">results</a> showed maturity in the project functionality. The Jepsen team also pointed out a few areas for improvements, which were implemented by the etcd team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From the beginning, etcd was designed to ease consensus store operations, making it attractive for use with container orchestration systems like Kubernetes. etcd’s selection as the control plane storage for Kubernetes proved a great fit, and two projects have grown and matured together,” said Joe Betz, etcd maintainer and software engineer at Google Cloud. “We are excited to see etcd’s dedication toward reliability, scalability, and quality recognized by the CNCF with this graduation. Today’s announcement is a testament to the maturity of etcd and its readiness for production workloads.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today’s major milestone of the graduation of etcd, could not have been accomplished without the work of the community and the support from the CNCF,” said Sahdev Zala, senior software engineer, open technology, IBM and etcd maintainer. “etcd is playing a critical role providing a distributed key-value store that is highly available and meets the strong consistency requirements demanded by large scale Kubernetes clusters.”</p>



<p>“Open source software powers our lives in so many ways,” said Bob Wise, General Manager of Kubernetes at AWS. “From Linux to Kubernetes, open communities of builders from all sizes of organizations and walks of life spend considerable time creating and maintaining projects that underpin much of the internet, telecommunications, finance, transportation, gaming, retail, and healthcare systems we use every day.&nbsp; etcd is one of these critical projects, and we’re proud to have etcd as a core part of Amazon EKS and to be involved in helping the project grow and thrive. We are fervent supporters of etcd’s graduation and look forward to collaborating with etcd and other CNCF projects to build secure, reliable, powerful, and scalable open source software.”</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project was certified for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3192">CII Best Practices Badge</a>, completed security audits and addressed vulnerabilities, defined its own <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a>, and adopted the <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">CNCF Code of Conduct</a>.</p>



<p><strong>etcd Background</strong></p>



<p>etcd is a distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:</p>



<ul><li>Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)</li><li>Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication</li><li>Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec</li><li>Reliable: properly distributed using Raft</li></ul>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Consider a simple assignment statement in Python:</p>



<p>The meaning of this statement may seem trivial. What we do here is take the value of the name <code>b</code> and assign it to the name <code>a</code>, but do we really? This is an ambiguous explanation that gives rise to a lot of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean for a name to be associated with a value? What is a value?</li>
<li>What does CPython do to assign a value to a name? To get the value?</li>
<li>Are all variables implemented in the same way?</li>
</ul>
<p>Today we'll answer these questions and understand how variables, so crucial aspect of a programming language, are implemented in CPython.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Start of the investigation</h2>
<p>Where should we start our investigation? We know from the previous parts that to run Python code, CPython compiles it to bytecode, so let's start by looking at the bytecode to which <code>a = b</code> compiles:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ echo 'a = b' | python -m dis

  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (b)
              2 STORE_NAME               1 (a)
...
</pre></div>


<p><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">Last time</a> we learned that the CPython VM operates using the value stack. A typical bytecode instruction pops values from the stack, does something with them and pushes the result of the computation back onto the stack. The <code>LOAD_NAME</code> and <code>STORE_NAME</code> instructions are typical in that respect. Here's what they do in our example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LOAD_NAME</code> gets the value of the name <code>b</code> and pushes it onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>STORE_NAME</code> pops the value from the stack and associates the name <code>a</code> with that value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last time we also learned that all opcodes are implemented in a giant <code>switch</code> statement in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L1464"><code>Python/ceval.c</code></a>, so we can see how the <code>LOAD_NAME</code> and <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcodes work by studying the corresponding cases of that <code>switch</code>. Let's start with the <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcode since we need to associate a name with some value before we can get the value of that name. Here's the <code>case</code> block that executes the  <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcode: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>STORE_NAME</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>GETITEM</span><span>(</span><span>names</span><span>,</span> <span>oparg</span><span>);</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>POP</span><span>();</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>f_locals</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>err</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ns</span> <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>_PyErr_Format</span><span>(</span><span>tstate</span><span>,</span> <span>PyExc_SystemError</span><span>,</span>
                      <span>"no locals found when storing %R"</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Py_DECREF</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>);</span>
        <span>goto</span> <span>error</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>PyDict_CheckExact</span><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span>))</span>
        <span>err</span> <span>=</span> <span>PyDict_SetItem</span><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>err</span> <span>=</span> <span>PyObject_SetItem</span><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>Py_DECREF</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>goto</span> <span>error</span><span>;</span>
    <span>DISPATCH</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let's analyze what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li>The names are strings. They are stored in a code object in a tuple called <code>co_names</code>. The <code>names</code> variable is just a shorthand for <code>co_names</code>. The argument of the <code>STORE_NAME</code> instruction is not a name but an index used to look up the name in <code>co_names</code>.  The first thing the VM does is get the name, which it's going to assign a value to, from <code>co_names</code>.</li>
<li>The VM pops the value from the stack.</li>
<li>Values of variables are stored in a frame object. The <code>f_locals</code> field of a frame object is a mapping from the names of local variables to their values. The VM associates a name <code>name</code> with a value <code>v</code> by setting <code>f_locals[name] = v</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We learn from this two crucial facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python variables are names mapped to values.</li>
<li>Values of names are references to Python objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic for executing the <code>LOAD_NAME</code> opcode is a bit more complicated because the VM looks up the value of a name not only in <code>f_locals</code> but also in a few other places:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>LOAD_NAME</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This code translates to English as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>As for the <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcode, the VM first gets the name of a variable.</li>
<li>The VM looks up the value of the name in the mapping of local variables: <code>v = f_locals[name]</code>.</li>
<li>If the name is not in <code>f_locals</code>, the VM looks up the value in the dictionary of global variables <code>f_globals</code>. And if the name is not in <code>f_globals</code> either, the VM looks up the value in <code>f_builtins</code>. The <code>f_builtins</code> field of a frame object points  to the dictionary of the <code>builtins</code> module, which contains built-in types, functions, exceptions and constants. If the name is not there, the VM gives up and sets the <code>NameError</code> exception. </li>
<li>If the VM finds the value, it pushes the value onto the stack.</li>
</ol>
<p>The way the VM searches for a value has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>We always have the names from the <code>builtin</code>'s dictionary, such as <code>int</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>ValueError</code> and <code>None</code>, at our disposal.</li>
<li>
<p>If we use a built-in name for a local variable or a global variable, the new variable will shadow the built-in one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local variable shadows the global variable with the same name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all we need to be able to do with variables is to associate them with values and to get their values, you might think that the <code>STORE_NAME</code> and <code>LOAD_NAME</code> opcodes are sufficient to implement all variables in Python. This is not the case. Consider the example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>_</span><span>():</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>z</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The function <code>f</code> has to load the values of variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> to add them and return the result. Note which opcodes the compiler produces to do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis global_fast_deref.py
...
  7          12 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (x)
             14 LOAD_FAST                0 (y)
             16 BINARY_ADD
             18 LOAD_DEREF               0 (z)
             20 BINARY_ADD
             22 RETURN_VALUE
...
</pre></div>


<p>None of the opcodes are <code>LOAD_NAME</code>. The compiler produces the <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code> opcode to load the value of <code>x</code>, the <code>LOAD_FAST</code> opcode to load the value of <code>y</code> and the <code>LOAD_DEREF</code> opcode to load the value of <code>z</code>.  To see why the compiler produces different opcodes, we need to discuss two important concepts: namespaces and scopes.</p>
<h2>Namespaces and scopes</h2>
<p>A Python program consists of code blocks. A code block is a piece of code that the VM executes as a single unit. CPython distinguishes three types of code blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>module</li>
<li>function (comprehensions and lambdas are also functions)</li>
<li>class definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler creates a code object for every code block in a program. A code object is a structure that describes what a code block does. In particular, it contains the bytecode of a block. To execute a code object, CPython creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Besides other things, a frame object contains name-value mappings such as <code>f_locals</code>, <code>f_globals</code> and <code>f_builtins</code>. These mappings are referred to as namespaces. Each code block introduces a namespace: its local namespace. The same name in a program may refer to different variables in different namespaces:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>"I'm a variable in a global namespace"</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>"I'm a local variable"</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>f</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>


<div><pre><span></span>$ python namespaces.py 
I'm a variable in a global namespace
I'm a variable in a global namespace
I'm a local variable
I'm a variable in a global namespace
</pre></div>


<p>Another important notion is the notion of a scope. Here's what the Python documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces">says about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>scope</em> is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can think about a scope as a property of a name that tells where the value of that name is stored. The example of a scope is a local scope. The scope of a name is relative to a code block. The following example illustrates the point:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span>
    <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, the name <code>a</code> refers to the same variable in both cases. From the function's perspective, it's a global variable, but from the module's perspective, it's both global and local. The variable <code>b</code> is local to the function <code>f</code>, but it doesn't exist at the module level at all.</p>
<p>The variable is considered to be local to a code block if it's bound in that code block. An assignment statement like <code>a = 1</code> binds the name <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>. An assignment statement, though, is not the only way to bind a name. The Python documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming-and-binding">lists a few more</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following constructs bind names: formal …</p></blockquote></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today, I want to address an issue with statements involving chance. To demonstrate, let’s first consider a statement that doesn’t involve chance:</p>

<p>“<em>A cubic die tossed onto a flat surface will come to rest on one of its six sides.</em>”</p>

<p>This claim can be empirically tested, with various dice and surfaces. If any one of our experiments results in the die spinning endlessly on a corner, we will have disproven the claim. We may have to refine the claim’s conditions; for instance, by requiring the presence of gravity. Nonetheless, it’s fairly clear what it means for the statement to be true or false. Now let’s try to make a claim involving probability:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown, the probability of their face-up sides summing to nine will be one in nine (about 0.11 or 11%).</em>”</p>

<p>What does it mean for this statement to be true? Unlike the first statement, this one doesn’t specify which result we’ll actually see. How can we possibly hope to test it, or to make use of its information?</p>



<p>Within the realm of abstract mathematics, we’re free to model probability in a way that fits our intuitions. Imagine a multiverse containing an infinity of possible worlds, whose total <em>measure</em> is 100%. Define the probability of an <em>event</em>, such as that of rolling a nine, to be the measure assigned to the subset of worlds in which the event actually occurs.</p>

<p>In the abstract formalism, we’re allowed to assign the measure however we like, subject to Kolmogorov’s axioms: the measure must be non-negative, countably additive, and total to 100%. By respecting the symmetry of an idealized die,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> we might argue that only one such assignment makes sense; from it, we can calculate the probability of any event involving dice rolls.</p>

<p>There are two shortcomings to this approach. Firstly, we won’t always deal with nicely symmetrical objects for which direct a priori arguments are possible. Thus, we still need a means of testing probabilistic claims using real-life observations. Secondly, such arguments can never be airtight: after all, how can we hope to infer the measure on a hypothetical multiverse, when we only ever experience <em>one</em> world? Indeed, a realist might question if it makes any sense to discuss the chances of an event happening: either it happens or it doesn’t!</p>



<p>You might be more trusting of someone who puts their money where their mouth is. To back up a definite claim, not involving chance, I can simply agree to pay a penalty if it turns out I’m wrong.</p>

<p>This idea can be extended to probabilistic claims in the following manner: consider a lottery that pays a $90 jackpot if the next roll of a pair of dice yields a nine. If the maximum that I’m willing to pay to play is $10, this indicates that I believe a not-nine roll is eight times more likely than a nine roll. This approach is appealing because, after all, the <em>raison d’être</em> of probability theory is to explain the decision-making of individuals facing uncertainty.</p>

<p>If another gambler’s view conflicts with mine, you may aggregate our beliefs by creating a market on which we buy and sell predictions. Consider a contract that pays $100 (plus interest) when a specified event occurs. Its price on the market can be interpreted as the percentage probability of that event. Thus, to say an event is twice as “likely” as another, simply means its market price is double.</p>

<p>Unlike your typical gambler, a frictionless market offers transparent near-identical buy and sell prices. As a result, any violations of Kolmogorov’s axioms become money-making arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrage activity acts as an enforcer of the axioms, creating what economists call the <em>risk-neutral probability measure</em>.</p>

<p>In real markets, however, this probability measure exhibits several inconsistenties. Firstly, it depends on which currency is used: as an extreme example, we wouldn’t buy a dollar-denominated wager that only pays out if the dollar collapses, no matter how likely we imagine the collapse to be. Secondly, this measure is sensitive to (non-diversifiable) risk: if a widely-believed prophecy held that rolling a nine would induce a catastrophic famine, the market would value this outcome a lot more, because everyone wants to buy insurance against such a catastrophe. Thirdly, markets can be misinformed: indeed, one motivation for participating in a market is to try to beat it! And finally, liquid markets are hard to set up.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we abandon this approach. We’ll seek to define probability in terms of actual outcomes instead of human bets. Nonetheless, human bets are what inspired the creation of probability theory: it’s hard to think of any other practical application! Therefore, we should remember to revisit the matter once we’ve found an appealing probability concept. Ultimately, we must be able to explain <em>how</em> individuals and markets behave with respect to our concept, and answer <em>why</em> they should care about it at all.</p>

<p>These questions are incredibly subtle: the theory of evolution by natural selection tells us that individuals are wired to use strategies that enabled their ancestors’ survival; however, the nature of probabilistic beliefs is that a wide range of outcomes are plausible. Indeed, while a coin will always land heads or tails, it’s considered unwise to bet your life savings on either heads or tails. Intuitively speaking, the rationale is that you’re almost certain to lose <em>eventually</em>, if you keep playing this way. This idea of repeated trials inspires our next interpretation, which happens to be the most popular among scientists.</p>



<p>According to the frequentist school of thought, a probabilistic statement is not to be taken literally. Although it refers to a single event, the statement should be taken as shorthand for a claim involving a very large collection of similar events. Imagine rolling the dice over and over. The probabilistic claim that we started with is converted into the following:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown repeatedly, then in the limit as the number of throws goes to infinity, the proportion of nines converges to one in nine (about 0.11 or 11%).</em>”</p>

<p>The short-run probability is replaced by a long-run proportion. Given an infinite sequence of rolls, this statement unambiguously reveals itself to be true or false. In light of the frequentist interpretation, we can even make more sense of our earlier interpretations. While we only experience one world, repeating an experiment under similar conditions is like observing the experiment in a parallel universe: whether we count trials or worlds, the math is virtually identical. In the limit of infinitely many bets, we can make some unambiguous conclusions about the quality of a gambler’s strategy, too: this is how casinos ensure that the house always wins!</p>

<p>Testing our claim is a simple matter: we roll the dice, over and over, and over and over… infinity times. Oops. Of course, there is no such thing as an experiment with infinity trials. Our arms will get tired, the dice will wear out, the Sun will explode, and all the free energy in the universe will be consumed. At best, we can do a very large number of trials. Let’s say we roll dice 9,000 times; one in nine of these would be 1,000. Perhaps we won’t roll exactly 1,000 nines, so let’s interpret our claim with a suitable margin of error, called a <em>confidence interval</em>:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown 9,000 times, then the face-up sides will sum to nine for between 920 and 1,080 of the throws.</em>”</p>

<p>The probability of obtaining between 920 and 1,080 nines can be calculated to be 99.3%.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Thus, we’ve turned a probabilitic statement into a much more certain but still probabilistic statement. If we observe 1,100 nines, we should be able to dismiss the probabilistic claim as false. And yet, if every household on Earth were to independently perform this 9,000-throw experiment, we should expect that a great many of their results would fall outside the confidence interval. They would disagree on the truth of our statement!</p>

<p>There’s no getting around it: despite its intuitive appeal, the frequentist definition of probability is circular, reducing probability claims to probability claims.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> To end the cycle, the frequentist chooses a threshold (say, 99%) beyond which to treat events as objective truths. This grants the claim an empirically observable meaning. And yet, the frequentist must take care not to consider too many such events, for otherwise the probability of <em>at least one</em> of the events failing may ALSO exceed the threshold of certainty: a logical contradiction.</p>

<p>Things only work out nicely in the limit of infinite sample size. Statisticians mainly deal with experiments which can be repeated so many times that, for most practical purposes, their conclusions can be treated as definite. Non-philosophers are usually happy to ignore a sub-1% chance of error; and if that’s not good enough, make it 0.0001%! Confidence can be increased by gathering more data, i.e., increasing the sample size.</p>

<p>This approach turns out to be very powerful. By designing more complex hypotheses in which probabilities vary as a function of context variables, even some phenomena that aren’t easily repeatable can be statistically analyzed. For example, weather forecasts are based on well-tested models that use measurements of variables such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, statistical models of sports games, democratic elections, or company stocks tend to be less testable: the interactions are very complex and there are too few outcomes from which to extrapolate. Similarly, when you try to predict which colleges will admit you or which of your friends will start a business, you don’t make your case using repeatable tests. Clearly, the frequentist interpretation cannot apply. One may argue that no conclusions in these cases would hold up to a scientific standard; nonetheless, if we seek a theory of decision-making under uncertainty, there’s no …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I’ve spent a lot of my time maintaining working code. I think that is more typical of software developers than working in greenfield development. Yes, there are definitely jobs where you are writing more new code than maintaining, upgrading, bug fixing and improving old code (startups without product market fit being one, consulting being another) but in general code is expensive and folks want to run it for a long time. </p>



<p>Often you’ll jump into code to fix a bug, investigate an issue or answer a question.</p>



<p>When you do so, improve it. This doesn’t mean you rewrite it, or upgrade all the libraries it depends on, or rename all the variables. </p>



<p>You don’t need to transform it. </p>



<p>But you should make it better. Just clean it up a bit. Doing so makes everyone’s lives just a bit better, helps the codebase in a sustainable way, and assists the business by making its supporting infrastructure more flexible.</p>



<p>What are some ways to improve the code when you are in it?</p>



<p><strong>Document</strong></p>



<p>Whether that is a comment that explains something tricky, a larger piece of documentation external to the code which explains how to interact with it, or fixing a typo, trustworthy documentation is key to interacting with code. This is a good way to start improving a codebase because it has minimal impact on the actual code. Therefore it is low risk. But if you’ve ever had a great comment explain a confusing bit of code, you’ll appreciate the time this effort can save.</p>



<p>You can also help documentation by removing old, crufty docs. If you see a comment that doesn’t apply, remove it. If there’s cut and paste documentation which doesn’t apply, get rid of it. That cleans up the code for the next person to come along (who might be you).</p>



<p><strong>Write a test or improve a test</strong> </p>



<p>Tests help you write maintainable, extensible code that others can change fearlessly. If you run across code that isn’t tested and you have time and the supporting framework to write one, do so. </p>



<p>Even if it tests simple functionality such as “can I instantiate this object” or “how does this function react when I pass it two null values”, an additional test will help the robustness of the code. </p>



<p><strong>Refactor it</strong></p>



<p>This is one of the most flexible improvements. Refactoring code can range from renaming a variable to be more true to its nature to an overhaul of an entire module. Start small and don’t get wrapped up in perfection. Make the code clearer in intent. </p>



<p>It’s easy with refactoring to get wound around an axle and make too many changes and end up with broken things. Timeboxing is one technique I use to avoid, or at least minimize, my tendencies toward this when refactoring. If all I have is 30 minutes, I’ll make my changes smaller in scope.</p>



<p>A warning about refactoring. Don’t refactor what you don’t understand. Don’t drive by refactor. Discuss your plan with someone more familiar with the code; <code>git blame</code> is your friend. Especially if the code is not well tested, you want to make sure you don’t do more harm than good.</p>



<p><strong>Upgrade a dependency</strong></p>



<p>It’s sometimes a winding path, but upgrading your dependencies regularly is a good way to maintain the code. I remember working in a fork of struts. It was an important application for the company, but we didn’t spend the time upgrading the dependencies, because it was too painful. Eventually, parts of the code became harder to update. The entire application couldn’t benefit from newer technologies and paradigms because of the older dependencies holding it back. </p>



<p>It never feels good to spend time updating a dependency; to me this always feels like running in place. But if you don’t do so, eventually dependencies will end of life and you’ll be forced to update. That’ll be even less pleasant. </p>



<p><strong>How to do it</strong></p>



<p><em>Based on feedback (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/k2cbtb/always_leave_the_code_better_than_you_found_it/gdv0kg9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this comment</a>, among others), I added this section on Nov 28.</em></p>



<p>When you are making these changes to improve the code, you’ll help out code reviewers and your future self by making changes that are improving the code separate from changes that add functionality. Whether you do this in separate pull requests, tickets, or commits depends on your team culture. Ask about that. But such separation will make it easier for people who aren’t familiar with the changes to understand them and give feedback on them, whether that is a code review this week or someone reviewing this component two years from now.</p>



<p><strong>Why do it</strong></p>



<p>All of these actions not only help others because they improve the quality of the code, they also provide examples to other developers on how to do so. For example, it is far easier to write the second test in a suite than the first. You can cut and paste a lot of the setup code and tweak only what is different. The first bit of documentation will inspire more.</p>



<p>Code isn’t everything, but it is an important work output. Whenever you touch it, you should strive to leave it in a better place that it was before you did so.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence and its subdomain Machine Learning (ML) have been showing promising trends over the past few years. At one side, AI is transforming the way of living and human interactions almost in every industry at large scale. On the other side the restrictions and polices imposed during COVID-19 pandemic has turned out to be an advantage for AI to grow. Given the lockdown situation and businesses turning towards digital transformation, AI has emerged as only futuristic technology that is not only solving and automating manual business workflows but also helping in <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-5-cost-cutting-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-cases-in-banking-and-finance/">reducing the cost</a>. Year 2020 has witnessed many unique platforms, researches and tools that utilize AI to great extent, but year 2021 has promised much more and quite rightly called as the <strong>golden year</strong> for AI implementation.</p><p>Read also: <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-10-ai-trends-to-watch-in-2020/">Top AI trends for year 2020</a></p><p>The global AI market size was calculated as $39.9 Billion in 2019 and expected to achieve <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market">compound annual growth rate</a> (<strong>CAGR</strong>) up to 42.2% from 2020 to 2027. Technology has made innovations in big fields like healthcare, retail, automobile, and finance with continuous research. AI is one significant element that is promising to dominate and transform the digital era entirely with high accuracy and precision.</p><p>In this article, we have come up with <strong>Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Trends to watch in year 2021</strong>. These have the potential to hit great innovation in future. Let's have a look at these strategies:</p><h2 id="1-robotic-process-automation-rpa-">1. &nbsp;Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h2><p>It's one of the most disruptive AI technologies that help in performing repetitive manual tasks. It can efficiently perform a high-volume, repetitive task on the desktop without creating any mess. The work might be of invoicing a client. For it, the robot opens email via RPA, copy the given data into a CRM database and then collect data from another related database. It replies to that client with new data. Besides, it can perform the given task multiple times in a day and saves human’s time to do some other productive task.</p><p>Robotic Process Automation is a robot that works on using software for performing repetitive manual tasks. If there is something beyond the knowledge of robot, it notifies its owner to step in. in a nutshell, RPA performs the mundane task and give time to people for more exciting work.</p><p>RPA would be in use in billing, invoicing, payroll processing, extracting data, tracking, and shipment scheduling. Its also known as <strong>Hybrid Workforce </strong>that shows the collaboration of human workforce with robots.</p><p><strong>Vanguard </strong>is a financial service providing company that comes <a href="https://about.vanguard.com/who-we-are/fast-facts/">$5.6 trillion</a> in global assets under management department. The company uses <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3048318/roboadvisors-stand-at-the-vanguard-of-human-machine-collaboration.html">RPA</a> for doing exceptional trading tasks. It works with, "when x happens, do y." However, the RPA system cannot eliminate the need for humans. The combination of humans and technology helps in providing better services to clients and allowing humans to focus on complex tasks.</p><h2 id="2-ai-in-healthcare">2. &nbsp;AI in Healthcare</h2><p>AI is already helping the healthcare industry to a great extent with high accuracy, but further advancements will surprise everyone. AI developing companies are struggling hard to create advanced tools for enhancing the health industry’s capabilities—AI-inspired humans in recovering patients from recent pandemic COVID-19. <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27745/big-data">Big Data</a> was used to identify COVID Patients and significant hot spots. Moreover, researchers developed thermal cameras and <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2953/mobile-application-mobile-app">smartphone apps</a> for measuring the temperature of individuals and collecting data for healthcare organizations.</p><p>AI can help healthcare department in many unique ways by using data analysis and predicting different results. AI and ML tools provide insights about human health and also suggest preventive measures to stop the disease spreading. There is another AI trend; AI Watches that can help doctors to track their patient’s health remotely.</p><h3 id="predicting-pandemic-even-before-it-s-start">Predicting Pandemic Even Before It’s Start</h3><p>Now researchers are working on advanced AI algorithms for accurately predicting future outbreaks. Some of the significant research is already done on it that generated some earliest alerts about the current pandemic. In Wuhan, China, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/bluedot-used-artificial-intelligence-to-predict-coronavirus-spread.html"><strong>BlueDot Tool</strong></a><strong> </strong>by Toronto was scanning over 100,000 governmental and media data daily and shared an alert about the potential pandemic.</p><h2 id="3-ai-for-cybersecurity-data-breaches">3. &nbsp;AI for Cybersecurity &amp; Data Breaches</h2><p>The use of advanced AI tools will collect and analyze a wide range of data sets. It will fetch information from news, blogs, websites, and stories to identify all threats. As it collects more data, the system will become more precise.</p><p>In 2021 and beyond, digital data will be at more risk to be hacked and vulnerable to phishing attacks. AI and advanced technologies will provide support to the security department against malicious activities in every field. AI will help to prevent cybercrimes in future with enhanced enterprise <a href="https://thinkml.ai/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> measures. The AI-supported system will spot fake digital activity or transactions that follow criminal patterns.</p><p>Its preventive alarms will protect sensitive data information from data hacking firms. Furthermore, it will take only a few seconds to detect any threatening activity, including suspicious IP addresses. It allows security dealers to respond to these activities faster than usual. Because of its high efficiency and advantages, the demand for AI in cybersecurity will rise in 2021.</p><h2 id="4-natural-language-processing-nlp-">4. &nbsp;Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2><p>Here machine learning models teach computers to understand what's written or spoken material describing a specific process. It becomes one of the top and highly-demanded application of AI in the present time. The popularity of NLP is rising because of its significant usage as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. NLP eliminated the need for writing or interacting with a screen as now humans interact with robots that understand their language.</p><p>Natural Language Processing comes with two sub-applications.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Understanding: </strong>As its name shows, it enables a machine to review a written text and understands its meaning correctly.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Generation: </strong>It’s a logical response that a machine generates for any given input, for instance, any text.</p><p>The use of NLP will increase in 2021 for sentiment analysis, machine translation, summarizing a process, auto-video caption generation and as chatbots.</p><p>YouTube uses NLP technology in generating captions automatically across its platform. YouTube Video involves a <strong>speech recognition software </strong>that produces video cations. The system used this technology first in 2009 for translation of dozens of languages.</p><h2 id="5-reinforcement-learning">5. &nbsp;Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>Reinforced Learning (RL) is one of the demanded skills of future by different organizations. It's a particular application of deep learning that works based on its experience for improving data's effectiveness.

<p><strong>DECODING THE DRUIDIC DODECAHEDRON </strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Dodecahedron%20Types.jpg" width="900" height="438"></p>
<p><strong>These bronze artefacts are so-called <em>Roman</em> dodecahedra (plural of dodecahedron)  of which about 120 have been found in the Celtic countries of Europe. Strangely, none of these have been found in Italy, home turf of the Romans.</strong> <strong>To the left is seen a dodecahedron from the Römermuseum Schwarzenacker, Homburg, Germany collection. To the right is seen another pristine example from the Hunt Museum in Limerick Ireland </strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Dodecahedron%20Types3.jpg" width="935" height="438"></p>
<p><strong>To the left is a dodecahedron from Archaeological  Service Canton Aargau, Brugg, Switzerland (Vindonissa Museum). To the right is a dodecahedron from the Gallo-Roman Museum, Tongeren, Belgium. </strong></p>
<p>The basic design of these artefacts remains relatively constant (12 pentagonal faces with knop-shaped legs), however, there can be a range of different  incised designs in the layout of the faces<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>The actual function of these artefacts cannot be explained by our historians or archaeologists, although many theories abound,  none of which seem particularly convincing. Also, there is no  mention of these items in old historical records of the Romans or those of anyone else for that matter. They are such an enigma that academics have pretty-much come to the defeatist conclusion that <em><strong>"we will never know what these dodecahedrons were used for". </strong></em></p>
<p>In reviewing the academic literature, one begins to see why the mystery will probably never be solved within that community. Here are some of the impediments and pitfalls our experts create for themselves:</p>
<p>All archaeological measurements are given in metric increments (centimetres or millimetres), which is a modern system that was created as much as 2000-years after some of these dodecahedra were cast in bronze. Earlier exemplars in stone or wood could predate the latter, more refined ones, by yet another thousand years or more. This  metric measurement preoccupation renders the  encoded numbers invisible or unrecognisable. Our academics know a large swathe of the ancient measurements that were in use two thousand years ago or before, so why not apply them to this study? </p>
<p>Most assuredly, the various sized holes in the 12-faces, the concentric circles that circumnavigate them, as well as the additional incised lines or dotted circles, etc, infer that there is something vividly measurable going on and it's evident that each hole or ring  has been very purposely fabricated to represent a known, precise and sought-after measurement.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Calibrated.jpg" width="900" height="476"> </p>
<p><strong>A number of dodecahedra have calibration marks along their edges or around the holes in their faces. To the left is seen a calibrated dodecahedron from Hereford Museum, Kenchester and to the right is seen another from Goodrich Castle. Yet another one found in Wales shows etched calibration marks. </strong></p>
<p>In their reports,  archaeologists will often round out measurements of the holes in the dodecahedron faces to the nearest millimetre only, which is grossly insufficient. It's much appreciated by researchers when measurements can be supplied to 1/10th  of a millimetre, but  it is nigh on impossible  to acquire more refined measurements undertaken with electronic vernier callipers. Precise measurements and scaling must precede any serious analysis of these artefacts, but our experts don't seem to think there would be anything significant to find anyway, so don't subject the dodecahedra to rigorous measurement analysis.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that 25.4 millimetres (1 British Standard Inch) or fraction expressions of the same will recur repeatedly in the faces of dodecahedra, no-one seems to have arrived at the conclusion that the enigmatic<em><strong> "inch"</strong></em> recurrence is worthy of serious investigation. </p>
<p>Almost anything considered high-art, technically advanced or an engineering feat within ancient European civilisations seems to be automatically attributed to the Romans, which is certainly the case for these dodecahedra artefacts. This  is a hangover of biased, classicist-isolationist historical  interpretations of  European history where, first came the  Roman conquerors, who finally retreated after centuries of domination, only to be replaced by Rome's State church. With the pedigree of the church being Greco-Roman it was in their interests to push the concept that the Roman armies had found everything in the regions they invaded to be backwards, rudimentary or crude until Rome delivered the great-unwashed masses out of their depravity and into  enlightenment and high-civilisation. </p>
<p>This general process of misattribution further hobbles or seriously limits proper investigation into the purpose and function of dodecahedra artefacts, inasmuch as focus is  directed, almost exclusively, to what Roman armies might have used them for as range-finders or other battle related paraphernalia, including club-heads. The druids or others don't get  any serious consideration, despite the fact that they are historically recorded as having been  advanced mathematicians and astronomers.</p>
<p>Within controlled academia the ability to do open-ended, ground-breaking research can be severely curtailed by the requirements of <em><strong>"peer review"</strong></em> by colleagues.  This is largely a racket that ensures one doesn't move too far from the protected consensus opinion upon which academic reputations are built and anyone venturing too far out into left field is considered a maverick who threatens the insulated central body.</p>
<p>By the same token academia, these days, is lumbered with deep-set social responsibilities and crippling political agendas. When it comes to European history, especially, the requirement is to be self-effacing, while lauding and applauding the (often meager) accomplishments of other ethnicities. Under  guises of political correctness and racial sensitivity, the door is opened for antagonistic non-European, prejudiced individuals, to write and interpret  our history for us, while pushing their own  cultural-Marxist or similar wheel-barrows.  All one has to do is sit through lectures in our western universities to see just how far out of kilter the abysmal problem of  European history-misrepresentation has become.</p>
<p>But, with regards to the dodecahedra artefacts,what one person can build, another can generally duplicate or back-engineer, sufficient to make sense of what's going on. </p>
<p>So, let's cut to the chase, bypass all the  confusion of modern-day naysayers and source testimony directly from an observer who lived contemporary to the druids, before they fell under Roman domination </p>
<p>Julius Caesar, who was a very thorough historian, writes the       following regarding the late era druids of his time (circa 55 BC) and        practices within their many universities in Britain, where students from Gaul       and elsewhere, including Rome, went for training:</p>
<p><strong>'They hold aloof from war and do not pay war taxes; they       are excused from military service and exempt from all liabilities. Tempted       by these great advantages, many young men assemble of their own motion to       receive their training, many are sent by parents and relatives. Report says       that in the schools of the Druids they learn by heart a great number of verses,       and therefore some persons remain twenty years under training'. </strong></p>
<p><strong>'They do not think it proper to commit these utterances to       writing, although in all other matters and in their public and private accounts       they make use of Greek characters. I believe that they have adopted the practice       for two reasons- that they do not wish the rule to become common property,       nor those who learn the rule to rely on writing and so neglect the cultivation       of memory; and, in fact, it does usually happen that the assistance of writing       tends to relax the diligence of the student and the action of memory...They       also lecture on the stars in their motion, the magnitude       of the Earth and its divisions, on natural history, on the power and       government of God; and instruct the youth in these subjects' <em>(see De Ballo       Gallico, VII, 15, 16.).</em></strong></p>
<p>Historian, Isabel Hill Elder  writes, <strong>'The students at these       colleges numbered at times sixty thousand of the youth and young nobility       of Britain and Gaul. Caesar comments on the fact that the Gauls sent their       youth to Britain to be educated...It required twenty years to master the complete       circle of Druidic knowledge. Natural philosophy, astronomy,       mathematics, geometry, medicine, jurisprudence, poetry and oratory       were all proposed and taught-natural philosophy and       astronomy with severe exactitude' (Elder refers to <em>Strabo I IV,       page 197. Caesars Comm. Lib V. Sueotonius, V Calegula. E. Campion, Accounts       of Ireland, pg. 18.).</em></strong></p>
<p>Isabel Hill Elder further writes,<strong> 'The education system       adopted by the Druids is traced to about 1800 BC when Hu Gardarn Hysicion       (Isaacson), or Hu the Mighty, led the first colony of Cymri into Britain from       Defrobane, where Constantinople now stands'.</strong> </p>
<p>Further commenting on Hu       Gardarn Hysicion, Isabel Hill Elder writes that he, <strong>'is commemorated in       Welsh archaeology as having made poetry the vehicle of memory'.</strong> Elsewhere       she writes, he <strong>'is said to have mnemonically systematized the wisdom of       the ancients...'.</strong> She goes on to say,<strong> 'The published compositions of       the Druids and Bards form but a very small portion of the extant remains of       their works. The Myvyrian MSS. alone, now in the British Museum, amount to       47 volumes of poetry, in 1600 pages, besides about 2000 epigrammatic stanzas.       Also in the same collection are 53 volumes of prose, in about 15,300 pages,       containing many curious documents on various subjects...' <em>(see Celt, Druid       and Culdee, pages 54 &amp; 55).</em></strong></p>
<p>With the testimony of Julius Caesar ringing in our ears, lets see how the druids would have used the dodecahedron artefacts as <em><strong>"memory"</strong></em>devices for mathematically encoding astronomical cycles,<em><strong> ("the stars in their motion")</strong></em>, navigation systems <em><strong>("the …</strong></em></p></div>

			<p><span>I</span>t’s easy to name science and math geniuses. I can just flip open my old book from the 1960s, which lists “100 Great Scientists”; it contains all the names you’d find on most popular lists of scientific geniuses: Einstein, Newton, Maxwell, Gauss, Bohr, Archimedes, Darwin, Galileo, and 92 others. </p> <p>But the geniuses of popular notoriety aren’t the only great minds of scientific history. That book and other such lists overlook many deserving names—the unsung geniuses overshadowed by more publicity-savvy rivals or under-appreciated because of when and where they lived. Presented below are my Top 10 of those insufficiently recognized scientific geniuses of all time, listed in chronological order.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this is science and math only, so no <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/shakespeares-genius-is-nonsense" target="_blank">Shakespeare</a>, no Bobby Fischer, no Lennon and McCartney. Also, nobody still living is eligible—wouldn’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings.</p> <p>And remember, for list-making purposes, genius shouldn’t simply be thought of as high IQ. It’s more a combination of intellectual capacity and what was achieved with it. Geniuses transcend the time in which they live, contributing insights that allow future scientists to be smarter than the geniuses of the past. All the people listed here did that.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_BrahmaguptaGrosseteste.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4535_aee1bc7fa5da061b752d0efddbd16495.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>10. Brahmagupta (India, 598-c.670)</b></p> <p>A prominent astronomer, Brahmagupta wrote an extensive treatise covering such topics as the motions of the planets, eclipses, and the phases of the moon. But his genius emerged most prominently in mathematics. He introduced the idea of zero as a number like any other and discussed how to calculate with it. He was also the first to explain negative numbers, a concept thought by the Greeks to be “absurd.” Brahmagupta pointed out that multiplying two negative numbers (he called them “debts”) produced a positive number (in his terminology, a “fortune”).</p> <p><b>9. Robert Grosseteste (England, c. 1170-1253)</b></p> <p>Grosseteste was a prominent churchman who served as the Bishop of Lincoln for the last 18 years of his life. But in his earlier days he was a master of all the sciences, from medicine to cosmology. In fact, he was among the first modern scientific thinkers of the Middle Ages. He respected Aristotle but taught that experiment took precedence over authority. Grosseteste was an expert in optics, considering light to be the fundamental substance of existence; its power gave the cosmos shape, pushing matter around to form the heavenly spheres. Roger Bacon, the more widely known scientific pioneer of the 13th century, held Grosseteste in the highest esteem, while dismissing most other big scientific names of the day as dimwits.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_OresmeHarriot.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4536_cfbc6c5cfb8a3e10fab12aa3512153df.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>8. Nicole Oresme (France, c. 1320-1382)</b></p> <p>One of the most sophisticated mathematicians of his era, Oresme worked out the logical demonstration that all observable evidence was consistent with the Earth’s rotating on its axis, rather than the sun actually rising and setting. His true genius, however, was in then stating that he didn’t really believe that the Earth rotated, so that he could keep in good standing with the church (he was a bishop) and not get put under house arrest or burned at the stake. </p> <p><b>7. Thomas Harriot (England, c. 1560-1621)</b></p> <p>Harriot was a master of many sciences, starting with his role as scientist for an expedition to Roanoke Island in 1585. Later in his life he became the preeminent mathematician in England, a pioneer in the establishment of algebra for both pure and applied math. As an astronomer, he observed features on the moon and spotted the moons of Jupiter, possibly even before Galileo. His works on optics included an analysis of the physics of rainbows. Most of his writings went unpublished in his lifetime; hence many later mathematicians rediscovered much that Harriot had already accomplished or foreseen.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_ParentSomerville.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4537_26310c700ffd1b5095454f336ae96648.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>6. Antoine Parent (France, 1666-1716)</b></p> <p>Parent applied his versatile intellect to a vast scope of scientific fields. He investigated physics and astronomy, cartography and geometry, chemistry and biology, and even music. He was most astute in analyzing practical matters such as friction’s effect on motion and stresses on structural beams, and attempted to compute the theoretical maximum efficiency of machines. For his exemplar he chose water wheels, widely used to harness the power of flowing streams for such tasks as sawing wood or milling grain. Parent got the wrong answer, but nevertheless laid the groundwork for the second law of thermodynamics. Parent’s harsh criticism of Descartes’ science earned him no friends among his French colleagues, though, who considered Parent to be tactless and aggressive. After he died of smallpox, one obituary writer commented that Parent “had goodness without showing it.”</p><div>

</div> <p><b>5. Mary Somerville (Scotland, 1780-1872)</b></p> <p>She was the Carl Sagan of the 19th century, one of the most respected and prolific popularizers of science of her age. Her one year of formal schooling (at age 10) triggered enough curiosity that she taught herself algebra and geometry (mostly in secret, as her father disapproved). She married and moved to London, but her husband died young, so she returned to Scotland and to science. When asked to translate Laplace’s works on celestial mechanics into English, she turned the translation into a popular explanation, launching a career of writing books that conveyed the cutting edge of 19th-century science to the wider literate public. Her work, universally praised by the scientific community, combined the genius of insight with the ability to convey it.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_QueteletClifford.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4538_79fde5402cbc75ae0615c9ae4c335b46.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>4. Adolphe Quetelet (Belgium, 1796-1874)</b></p> <p>As a youth, Quetelet dabbled in writing operas and poetry, but wisely switched to math, before becoming an astronomer and ultimately the most accomplished statistician of his day. Quetelet especially perceived the importance of statistical reasoning for the social sciences. He demonstrated how the prevalence of various crimes could be predicted, for instance. He also recognized the fallacies that improper statistical reasoning could propagate, noting that the numbers said nothing about any individual, but that nonetheless the statistical construction of an “average man” could reveal much about society as a whole. Also, to the benefit (or annoyance) of many dieters, he developed the formula for Body Mass Index, so that you can properly quantify how overweight you are. </p> <p><b>3. William Kingdon Clifford (England, 1845-1879)</b></p> <p>A brilliant mathematician, Clifford was in ill health for most of his adult life and died at 33. Even so he earned international repute for his original approaches to geometry and other aspects of mathematics. His work foreshadowed aspects of Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Clifford pointed out that “some or all of those causes which we term physical may… be due to the geometrical construction of our space,” anticipating Einstein’s description of gravity as curvature in the geometry of spacetime, the combination of space and time implied by his special theory of relativity.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_BorelNoether.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4539_edb684859b848362ec56904286947614.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>2. Emile Borel (France, 1871-1956)</b></p> <p>By age 11, Borel’s genius was apparent enough that he left home to receive more advanced instruction and eventually made his way to Paris, where he observed that the most exciting and fulfilling lives were led by mathematicians. He became an enormously productive scholar, with major contributions to set theory (the branch of math that studies the properties of collections of objects) and probability theory. And in the 1920s he established many of the fundamental principles of game theory (the math for calculating optimum strategies)—unknown to John von Neumann, who invented them all over again. </p> <p><b>1. Amalie Emmy Noether (Germany, 1882-1935)</b></p> <p>In the mid-19th century, several men figured out the law of conservation of energy, but it was Emmy Noether who figured out <i>why</i> energy is conserved. It’s a consequence of a symmetry in nature, specifically the symmetry of time—physical law remaining the same in the future as it has been in the past. What’s more, she showed that other symmetries also require conservation laws—symmetry in spatial direction guarantees conservation of angular momentum, for example. Noether contributed to many other realms of math, especially abstract algebra, and clarified some of the mathematical aspects of general relativity. Despite years of discrimination, she was eventually allowed to join the faculty at Göttingen, after the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert pointed out that the faculty senate was not a bathhouse.</p>  <p><i>Tom Siegfried is a freelance writer in northern Virginia and former editor in chief of</i> Science News.</p><p><i>This article first appeared online in our “Genius” issue in October, 2014.</i></p>

	                <p>
	Director Michael Allcock has a problem he’d like to share with the world.&nbsp; At a Christmas party, he was asked to dance by an attractive coworker. “I knew right there and then that, if I was going to go anywhere with this woman, I needed to get on that dance floor — pronto,” he remembers. “But I couldn’t do it. I stood there, utterly frozen in my tracks. I was simply paralyzed with fear and anxiety.”</p>
<p>
	Allcock has chorophobia — in Greek, chorós means dance — which is defined as a fear of dancing. He has rarely danced in public since he was a child. “Dancing is supposed to be fun,” he says. “Dancing is supposed to be liberating. Don’t I want to have fun? Don’t I want to feel free? Why can’t I dance? But then I found out I wasn’t alone.”</p>

    
    

<p>
	He decided to turn the camera on himself and go on a global quest to understand why he is so terrified by the simple act of dancing — a story told in the documentary Channel film <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/documentarychannel/docs/fear-of-dancing"><em>Fear of Dancing</em></a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Chorophobia is more common than you think</strong></p>
<p>
	Allcock estimates that there are hundreds of thousands of chorophobes. Among them is British actor and author Stephen Fry. “I really, really, really hate dancing and have not the slightest milligram of envy for those who can do it,” he says.</p>
<p>
	Another chorophobe Allcock encounters is American singer-songwriter Be Steadwell. She’s even written a song about it.</p>

    
    

<p>
	“The expectation for Black folks and Black women is to be a particular kind of dancer and to be good in a certain way,” Steadwell says in the documentary. “And I'm just not the person that, you know, someone's gonna see in a club and say, ‘Wow, you're a good dancer.’"</p>
<p>
	<strong>Humans have been dancing for a very, very long time</strong></p>
<p>
	We may be the only species to dance for pure pleasure.&nbsp; Nobody is exactly sure when we first started, but in <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/documentarychannel/docs/fear-of-dancing"><em>Fear of Dancing</em></a> Allcock takes us to one of the ancient places on earth where it may have started, Africa, a continent with cultures steeped in dancing.</p>
<p>
	It also appears the impulse to dance is an instinctual part of being human. Marcel Zentner, a professor at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, found that babies may be born with a predisposition to move rhythmically in response to music. “[Five- to 24-month-old infants] were ... played this music and then spontaneously, they would start to move,” he says.</p>
<p>
	Infants listened to a variety of sounds including classical music, rhythmic beats and speech. Their movements were recorded by video and 3D motion-capture technology and analyzed. The study found the better the children were able to synchronize their movements with the music, the more they smiled.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Fear of dancing develops as we grow older</strong></p>
<p>
	So why do some people grow up to be afraid of it? “If you had 50 people who all had a fear of dancing, they'd probably have 50 different reasons for why they have a fear of dancing,” says Peter Lovatt, a dance psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire in the U.K. The problem often starts during the teenage years when, “suddenly, dancing becomes about mate selection or about competency issues — moving your body in a way that your social group may find acceptable or unacceptable,” he says.</p>
<p>
	Allcock remembers that by the time he reached Grade 11, his lifestyle changed. He stopped going to class to front a band called Barbaric Fantasy. “It was all about partying,” he says. “I became a stereotype: the dropout metal-head stoner that's just too cool to dance.”</p>
<p>
	For a single guy back on the dating scene, the pressure to dance can be intense, and — like a fear of heights — chorophobia is real. “The only difference is no one would ever think of helping a person with that fear by dragging them to the edge of a building,” Allcock says.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Ways to help chorophobes learn to embrace dancing</strong></p>
<p>
	Champion ballroom dancer and instructor Olé Burlay thinks Allcock could overcome his fear if he just had the right teacher. “I think that the fact that people are afraid of dance is just because they’re not capable of doing it,” Burlay says. “So, if you get the right instructor that introduces it right away [in a] gentle form, that can be overcome.”</p>
<p>
	Jorge Ortiz, once a reluctant dancer, and his business partner, Rebekah Diaz, have developed a virtual studio to teach partner dance steps. “Hopefully, you get the experience of being in a flesh-and-blood dance studio without having the anxiety to actually have to walk through the doors,” says Ortiz.</p>

    
    

<p>
	Chorophobes in Toronto have found a novel way to bust a move. They meet once a week to dance together in a dimly lit room. “Darkness is such an equalizer,” says Eric Allin, one of the organizers of the party. “With the lights off, it's no longer a visual event. It takes on ... a more abstract meaning. You're unable to perceive others, and you're not being perceived.”</p>
<p>
	There is, Allcock says, a lack of understanding about people who have a fear of dancing, and he hopes his film creates more awareness about the problem. “I kind of resent the fact that society expects me to dance," he says. “It's almost like this is an act of rebellion for me not to dance.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Working in a Linux environment requires knowledge of Linux cli tools and troubleshooting. In this article, it would
be presented CLI tools that are most important for troubleshooting.
Short story
Let say you are working with Linux and your work would be: 1% once-time setup and 99% troubleshooting. So as we can see from these homemade statistics you going to spend most of your time in CLI and finding “why does not work”. This is not a trivial task. It requires knowledge of how Linux works, how subsystems of Linux works,
how complete “line” from typing command up to running, delivering some results works, logs.
Yes, logs are the most important.
So let me start with naming tools and then a short description of some of them.
fs2chk
du/dh
strace/ltrace
lsof
ldd
tcpdump
netstat
mailq/showq
traceroute/tracepath
ping/telnet/nc
dig
curl
nmap
top
ps
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
lsmod
awk
sed
vim</p>
<h3>fs2chk</h3>
<p>Used for file system integrity check. Not all time you will have regular shutdown or reboot –
sometimes it happens power goes off and your server gets back with a file system issue. Usually, in that
case is best to use fs2chk</p>
<h3>du/dh</h3>
<p>Command du is used to show space usage per partition. Sometimes happen your partition are used with
some dumb files/logs (crash files) and you need to see what is happening because application or service you try to run report free space issue. Command dh is used to check directory with sub-
directories and discover what file occupied most of the space.</p>
<h3>strace/ltrace</h3>
<p>Running application it just stops at some point. You don’t have logs. Nothing. And there is no debug switch (for example ssh -vvv, where you can see all steps that are done) or any other way to see what is hell going on. So strace is for functions that is used and ltrace are library that are used at some point.
We mostly need trace tool to see details of operation for some applications. Example: we run applications or services and we see an issue and we are not sure why.</p>
<h3>lsof</h3>
<p>You have an issue removing files/files because they are used by some unknown application. Or you want to see how much is open files so you can see if the maximum limit for open files is reached.</p>
<h3>ldd</h3>
<p>When the application does not run at all – the usual suspect is missing the library. This tool is handy to discover which library missing.</p>
<h3>tcpdump</h3>
<p>Connection to server sometimes has issues. So the best way to check what is going on and to troubleshooting is tcpdump. You can pick up the interface, type of protocol, from/to IP, or any low level for all TCP/IP layers.</p>
<h3>netstat</h3>
<p>Simple to see the status of open ports, connection state, and other information that we need to see if services running properly on a given port.</p>
<h3>mailq/showq</h3>
<p>The most vital service in each company is email. And sometimes you need to see what is happening with email (sending or recv). Best tool for this is mailq/showq (it is the same tool, showq is a new one that replace
mailq on older Linux)</p>
<h3>ethtool</h3>
<p>On a low level could happen issue with our ethernet connection and we want to review our cable/port on Linux. So the tool is best for this job. Beside this, you can review other specific ethernet things (auto-negotiation etc)</p>
<h3>traceroute/tracepath</h3>
<p>Ideal to see between server and client if there is a network path issue as also a delay between them.</p>
<h3>ping/telnet/nc</h3>
<p>The very handy tool on the first step to see if is server up as also services.</p>
<h3>dig</h3>
<p>With this tool, you can perform all DNS troubleshooting. Review MX records, A, NS, etc.</p>
<h3>curl</h3>
<p>One of the best tools for troubleshooting different protocols: HTTP, RTMP, FTP, etc. It also has a benchmark integrated for a view of response (DNS, first byte, etc).</p>
<h3>nmap</h3>
<p>A very good tool for discovering services, open ports, and other useful information. Also, you can use on your servers to check if there is some unusual thing and secure them.</p>
<h3>top</h3>
<p>Active process list with memory, CPU, parent/child connection, and other information that helps to see where the issue starts.</p>
<h3>ps</h3>
<p>Process list, you can check and see what is currently running (very quick, the first step for troubleshooting)
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
In troubleshooting we need to verify or to find some library or application – so this tool is best for that
operation.</p>
<h3>lsmod</h3>
<p>People who never have issues with kernel modules would never use this tool or get this tool seriously.
The tool provides information about loaded kernel modules as also usage, memory, etc.</p>
<h3>awk/sed/grep</h3>
<p>In a bunch of logs sometimes is a need to find proper information. All these tools are swiss knives for bash scripting and handy for parsing logs for specific information.</p>
<h3>vim</h3>
<p>The best editor in the world. Learn so you can answer on an interview how to quit vim.</p>

																				<p>BEIJING: China has powered up its first domestically developed nuclear reactor — Hualong One — a significant step in Beijing’s attempts to become less dependent on Western countries for energy security and critical technology.</p>
<p>The reactor, which was connected to the national grid on Friday, can generate 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year and cut carbon emissions by 8.16 million tonnes, according to China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).</p>
<p>“This marks China breaking the monopoly of foreign nuclear power technology and officially entering the technology’s first batch of advanced countries,” CNNC said in a statement.</p>
<p>Nuclear plants supplied less than 5% of China’s annual electricity needs in 2019, according to the National Energy Administration, but this share is expected to grow as Beijing attempts to become carbon-neutral by 2060.</p>
<p>Reducing its dependence on Western allies in critical high-tech sectors such as power generation is a key goal in Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars in state subsidies have been given to Chinese companies to speed the process — a move that has angered China’s trade partners and sparked a protracted trade row with Washington.</p>
<p>Work on the Hualong One reactor started in 2015 and there are currently six other reactors under construction at home and abroad, the state-owned plant operator CNNC said.</p>
<p>The Hualong One, deployed at a plant in the eastern province of Fujian, will be put into commercial use by the end of the year after undergoing tests.</p>
<p>China has 47 nuclear plants with a total generating capacity of 48.75 Gigawatts — the world’s third highest after the United States and France.</p>
<p>Beijing has invested billions of dollars to develop its nuclear energy sector in recent years as it struggles to wean its economy from coal.</p>
<p>Thirteen nuclear plants are under construction, more than in any other country, despite environmental and safety concerns.</p>
<p>In August 2016, officials were forced to shelve plans for a nuclear waste facility in Lianyungang, a city in eastern Jiangsu province, after a rare public protest by thousands of residents.</p>									</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Twitter can be a very useful source of information and news. Or, it can waste your time and make you sad. It’s all in how you use it. Here I’ll show you how to make Twitter work for you, instead of against you.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to turn Twitter into a useful tool, but there is one central concept that is more important than everything else combined. If you absorb and apply this idea, you will transform Twitter from a source of pointless irritation into a veritable lifehack.</p>
<p>The secret is to completely separate the concepts of <em>following</em> and <em>reading</em>.</p>
<p>Let me explain: the person finally giving in and signing up for Twitter looks for instruction and advice on how to get started and how to use it. This advice, either from helpful writers on the internet or from Twitter itself, goes something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Look for people who are interesting to you;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow them;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Observe your timeline, where their tweets will appear.</strong></p>
<p>If you follow this advice, you will be doing it wrong. This is the exact opposite of how you should use Twitter. The problems with this approach are:</p>
<p>You may see the tweets not always in the order in which they were tweeted, but in some other order that Twitter creates for you;</p>
<p>You will see “promoted tweets” interpolated between the tweets you signed up to see. This is paid advertising;</p>
<p>You will see random other things you didn’t ask for;</p>
<p>You will be inundated with “suggestions” from Twitter about people to follow, trending topics to keep on top of, and other irrelevant nonsense;</p>
<p>You will never see some of the tweets tweeted by the people you are following. They simply will not appear in your timeline;</p>
<p>Everyone can see the list of people you follow. You may or may not want this;</p>
<p>You will discover that the people you followed because you admire them have nothing interesting to say, only tweeting cat pictures and worn-out memes.</p>
<p>In short, you will be fed tons of stuff you never signed up for, and not get what you wanted.</p>
<p>You can’t turn <em>any</em> of this off. Twitter lets you tell it that you want to see <em>less</em> of some kinds of things, but there are no actual settings to turn off advertising or suggestions about fascinating hashtags.</p>
<p>The first step in fixing Twitter for yourself is to understand what following is really for. You don’t follow an account because you want to read their tweets. Twitter is “social media”, and following is a social signal. When you follow someone you are declaring that you approve of that person. Whether or not this is what you intended, this is how your decision to follow someone will be interpreted. If you are, for example, a journalist researching neo-Nazis, and part of your research involves tracking what they are saying on Twitter, you may not want to be seen as endorsing these people.</p>
<p>Obviously, you may want to read certain people’s tweets without following them. And you can! Twitter allows you to create private <em>lists</em> of accounts that you can track without following. You can see all their tweets scroll by without appearing to have endorsed them. The composition of your private lists, and even their existence, will remain secret. The people you add won’t know you’re adding them, nor that you’re seeing their tweets, unless you choose to interact with them. In addition, the tweets will appear in chronological order, with no interpolated advertising nor any other junk, unlike in your timeline. But you must not forget to mark the lists as private. In the picture below, one arrow points to the widget for creating a new list, and another points to the all-important checkbox for making the list private. You should only make private lists; there is no reason to make public lists, and, in fact, some people object to being placed in them (for some reason that escapes me, but behavior on Twitter is weird in many ways).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/newlist.png" alt="Making a list"></p>
<p>Make as many lists as you want, as fine-grained or as general as you think will be useful to you. You can have an astronomy list, or a list just with people who talk about astrophotography with iPhones. You can make a list for local news, and one for international news. You can put accounts in more than one list, so the exact composition of a list is not a crucial decision. This is how you separate the concepts of reading and following. You follow when you want to let people know you are following (hi, Mom), and you want everyone else to know, too. When you become famous and have a million followers, you can follow others to amplify their signals. Until then, follow to encourage, to lend support, and to let others know where you stand. If you also want to read the tweets of someone you follow (and you might not), put that person in one of your lists in addition. Your followee’s tweets will also appear in your timeline, but you won’t see them there, because <em>you will never look at your timeline</em>. Of course, you literally don’t have to follow a single person. Following is public. Aggregating accounts into lists is your private business.</p>
<p>Lists become most useful when there is an interface for conveniently seeing what’s on them. The regular Twitter clients are not very good for this, but Twitter has an alternative client that is made for it. Use <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-use-tweetdeck">TweetDeck</a>. It divides your twitterverse into columns. Each column can contain the tweets from one of your lists; in addition, you can create columns that track search terms, individual accounts, hashtags, your notifications, your direct messages, and more. By default, it will have a column with your timeline, but you can delete that, because, as I hope is clear by now, your timeline is a waste of time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/tweetdeck.jpg" alt="Tweetdeck. Picture by Ruben Schade">
</figure>
<p>This interface, although not perfect, helps a great deal in making Twitter more useful. If you keep it open, it can be a low-distraction way of monitoring recent tweets from low-traffic lists. You can delete columns you don’t care about today, and add them back in tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lists and search terms, combined with the avoidance of the timeline and the use of TweetDeck, already turns Twitter from a cesspool with advertising into a useful news feed. But by combining this with a few other practices, you can make Twitter even better.</p>
<p>First, control yourself. Use the platform as a source of timely information, and as a way to be helpful with others by offering information or advice. Do not, ever, no matter how strongly you feel that someone is <em><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a></em>, get into an argument on Twitter. I have often failed to heed this advice myself; do what I say, not what I do. Twitter can be a fantastic source of news from all over the world; it is often the first place you will hear about something, and sometimes the only place. It can be a very useful platform for receiving and offering technical information, such as links to papers. I recently contributed a scrap of code, in a tweet, for a maintainer of the venerable linux utility <code>curl</code>; the result is in <a href="https://github.com/curl/stats/commit/ac6ae20082fd5e61aa7122b1d4c6030e48ba52a9">this commit</a>. This kind of interaction is satisfying, but trying to have an actual discussion or argument never is, because it is impossible to do with this platform. At best, you will score points against someone not as clever as you; and that and $2.50 will get you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Next, use the muting function. Even members of your carefully curated lists will sometimes decide to spend a week talking incessantly about their new sneakers. Mute them until they get over it. <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/makeTwitterBetter/">Mute words and phrases</a>, too, for those times when a bunch of people are talking about something that you don’t care to see in your feeds (NBA playoffs, political debates, you name it).</p>
<p>When you discover someone interesting on Twitter, check their profile for a link to a website. <img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/redfern.png"> Click on it. If the person is worth following on Twitter, his or her website is likely to be of even more interest. Check the site for an Atom or RSS feed (look over to the right to see where I’ve used a version of the Atom/RSS feed icon). If there is one, subscribe in your feedreader.

<time datetime="2017-07-07">07 July 2017</time>

<p>After using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for a little while, there is a reasonable chance
you will run across the following hash:</p>
<pre><code>4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<p>So where does it come from, and why should you care?</p>
<h2>Where does the hash come from?</h2>
<p>Every git repository, even an empty repository will contain the hash. This
can be verified with <code>git show</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git show 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
tree 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<p>So where does this hash come from? Well internally Git keeps track of a few
different object types. The most fundamental object is a blob which represents
file content. Blobs are then referenced by tree objects which represent
directories and commit objects reference tree objects. The diagram below gives
a quick overview of this:</p>
<p><img alt="Git object diagram taken from Pro Git." src="https://floatingoctothorpe.uk/2017/pro-git-objects-diagram.png"></p>
<p><small>The diagram above is taken from <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> and licensed under
the Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
Unported</a> license.</small></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git Internals chapter</a> from Pro Git has more
info on objects if you're still curious.</p>
<p>So how does the hash fit in? Well it's actually the hash of an empty tree.
This can be verified by creating a object hash for either <code>/dev/null</code> of an
empty string:</p>
<pre><code>$ git hash-object -t tree /dev/null
4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904

$ echo -n '' | git hash-object -t tree --stdin
4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<h2>Using the hash</h2>
<p>The empty tree hash is often used with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">git diff</a>. For example
if you wanted to check for whitespace errors in a directory, you could use the
<code>--check</code> option and compare <code>HEAD</code> against the empty tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ git diff $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null) HEAD --check -- po
po/ca.po:7: trailing whitespace.
+# Terminologia i criteris utilitzats
po/ru.po:4: trailing whitespace.
+#
</code></pre>
<p>The empty tree hash is also very useful when writing git hooks. A fairly common
pattern is to validate new commits before accepting them with code similar to
the following:</p>
<pre><code>for changed_file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM HEAD)
do
  if ! validate_file "$changed_file"; then
    echo "Aborting commit"
    exit 1
  fi
done
</code></pre>
<p>This works fine if there are previous commits, however the HEAD reference will
not exist if no commits have been made. To get around this the empty tree hash
can be used when checking the initial commit:</p>
<pre><code>if git rev-parse --verify -q HEAD &gt; /dev/null; then
  against=HEAD
else
  # Initial commit: diff against an empty tree object
  against="$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)"
fi

for changed_file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM "$against")
do
  if ! validate_file "$changed_file"; then
    echo "Aborting commit"
    exit 1
  fi
done
</code></pre>

Quantitative finance is an inherently secretive field where people who become profitable never reveal their secret formulas of success. However, this has started to change in recent years thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089">Marcos Lopez de Prado</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Trading-Winning-Strategies-Rationale/dp/1118460146">Ernest Chan</a>, and others. Although algorithmic trading remains a difficult problem to solve, the knowledge that these people have given to the public is invaluable. At Tradytics, we are continuously reading the latest research and trying new ideas to create profitable trading algorithms. <b>Today, we are going to talk about one such AI system that has resulted in us beating the market by 20% in the last 1 month</b>. Although this time period is very short, we want to give others a taste of how things work at Tradytics and how we go about solving different problems. We are also going to continue creating automated systems with an intent to consistently beat the market. <b>Let us now talk about how we created 5 AI driven portfolios that each gained over 30% returns in the last 30 days.</b>

</p>





<h3> A Million Portfolios </h3>

<p>

Let's start with a basic idea of what we do before diving into the details. 

</p><blockquote>

	<p>We generate millions of random portfolios, optimize their allocation using existing and proprietary portfolio optimization algorithms, and rank them using our AI engine.</p></blockquote>



<p>There has been thousands of papers on portfolio optimization in the last three decades. Starting with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp">markowitz portfolio optimization theory</a> to the more recent <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/trading-strategies-reinforcement-learning">reinforcement learning based optimization</a> methods, there are countless research papers to read and implement. However, as is the case with the majority of proposed methods in literature, the portfolios are created based on historical returns. If there is one thing we know about the stock market, it's that historical returns are not always representatives of future returns. This is a major problem that one needs to solve in order to create effective portfolios. As market regimes change, algorithms that were based on historical data suddenly become ineffective. Therefore, we need a way to combine the literature with a novel mechanism of adding some predictive power to our portfolio optimization strategies.</p>





<h4> Portfolio Optimization Strategies at Tradytics </h4>

<p>

	At Tradytics, we use 3 strategies from literature and two proprietary ones based on genetic algorithms. These strategies are:

	</p><ul>

		<li><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/minimum-variance-portfolio-overview-4155796">Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://logical-invest.com/app/portfolio/maxsharpe/max-sharpe-portfolio">Maximum Sharpe Portfolio (MSR)</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3070416">Eigen Portfolios</a></li>

		<li>Genetic Portfolios (GA)</li>

		<li>Exponential Genetic Portfolios</li>

	</ul>

	<p>MVP, MSR, Eigen, and GA based portfolio optimizations have been studied in the literature in depth and many trading firms still use them. This is where we start as well but we add something important on top to make these strategies work well. As we said in the start of this section, our basic idea is to generate millions of random portfolios and rank them using our custom AI algorithms. The ranking system is where our novelty comes in. The following image visually explains our portfolio selection process.</p>

	<p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/m4N3gB4/block-diagram.png"></p><p>After generating millions of portfolios and optimizing their weights with the aforementioned strategies, we use our proprietary ranking system that ranks all these portfolios in terms of their future predicted returns. We keep the best portfolio for each of the five strategies which goes to our website at <a href="https://tradytics.com/ai-portfolios.">Tradytics AI Portfolios</a>. Let us now dive a bit deep into the portfolio generation and selection process.</p>





<h4> Portfolio Generation: A Case of 25 Random Portfolios </h4>

<div><p>

	The image below shows 25 random portfolios from a collection of millions of portfolios we generated on October 31st. We start with selecting 5 random stocks for every portfolio and optimize the portfolio on 1 year of historical data up till October 23rd. After optimization, we backtest the portfolios to look at their historical returns. Since optimization is being done on historical data, the backtested returns are expected to be high which is what we can see in the image below.

	</p><p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/gVM2VrD/backtest-returns.png"></p><p> 

	However, there is a huge problem here. Our optimization procedure only looks at historical data and has no inherent predictive power. It implicitly makes an assumption that historical returns are predictive of future returns. This is not always true and solely relying on this assumption can lead to huge losses. We can see this if we forward test our 25 portfolios from October 23rd to October 31st, 2020. 

	</p><p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/CQmyFQY/forward-returns.png"></p><p> 

	Although profitable on historical data, the portfolios are all at loss when ran live - some are down 20% in a week. This illustrates the problem at hand with portfolio optimization methods. Let us try to solve it.

</p></div>





<h3> Portfolio Selection: Tradytics AI Ranking </h3>



<p>

At Tradytics, we go one step further from portfolio optimization. Once we get these millions of optimized portfolios, we use our proprietary AI ranking algorithm to rank them based on what the AI thinks will be their future returns. The ranking procedure is basically a predictive model that predicts the returns of portfolios based on their allocation by the optimization method, their spreads with each other, and their historical returns. Once the ranking is done, we simply pick the best portfolio from each of the five strategies noted above, thus giving us 5 portfolios every month. Our main goal with these portfolios is to generate large returns and consistently beat the market. In order to preserve our alpha, we will not give any technical details away regarding our ranking system.

</p>



<div><p>

The first set of portfolios we generated was on October 31st. Our top 5 portfolios had the following allocations and stocks in them. The green weights indicate longing the stock while the red weights suggest shorting.

</p><p> 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/kqn36Gv/allocation.png"></p></div><p>

At the time of creating these portfolios, the weights did not make much sense by simply looking at each individual stock. However, since the ranking engine has been trained on a large amount of data and has high predictive power, it extracted certain patterns that made it confident that these portfolios would end up being profitable. Let us take a look at the returns of each individual stock as well as the entire portfolio.</p>





<h4> Portfolio Results: Top 5 Portfolios from October </h4>

<div><p>When looking at the backtest results of the top portfolios, it is easy to see that the historical returns are quite volatile would yield a low sharpe ratio. However, since history is not always the future and our ranking engine is tasked to predict the future returns, these portfolios were selected because of high AI confidence in larger returns.

</p><p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Mcgj8HV/picked-backtest-returns.png"></p><p> 



When these 5 portfolios were run live for the month of November, these yielded very high returns as compared to the market. The <b>$SPY</b> index gained about <b>10%</b> in the month of November. The following image shows the gains of each of our portfolios.</p><p> 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/PTPnqcj/portfolio-returns.png"></p></div><p>The results are quite impressive. All portfolios have garnered gains of above <b>30% in just 30 days</b> with some of them touching about <b>40%</b> cumulative returns. Now, we admit that there is a bias in the results here because of the strong bull market in the month of November. However, when the AI was ranking these portfolios, the bull market was not very strong - <b>$SPY</b> was down <b>2%</b> in October. It was the ranking engine that was able to find predictive patterns in the portfolios which would eventually result in large profits. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in portfolio selection.</p>





<h3> What's Next </h3>

<p>

Tradytics is a fairly new company in the quantitative finance game. We realize that these are short term results and we need to show consistency before we can make any claims about the AI capabilities of our toolkits. Our plan is to keep adding these portfolios every month and record the performance for atleast one year. The hope here is to consistently beat the market with significantly high returns. We will keep you updated. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at our <a href="https://discord.gg/QuvE2Z8">Discord</a>.

<p>Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But <strong>computers usually do not explain their predictions</strong> which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable.</p>
<p>After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, <strong>interpretable models</strong> such as decision trees, decision rules and linear regression. Later chapters focus on general model-agnostic methods for <strong>interpreting black box models</strong> like feature importance and accumulated local effects and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME.</p>
<p>All interpretation methods are explained in depth and discussed critically. How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning project.</p>
<p>The book focuses on machine learning models for tabular data (also called relational or structured data) and less on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Reading the book is recommended for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, statisticians, and anyone else interested in making machine learning models interpretable.</p>

<p>Use this interactive tool to overclock your Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 400 or Raspberry Pi 3B:</p>







<h2>How to overclock your Raspberry Pi using this tool </h2>



<p>This web-based tool allows you to quickly choose overclocking settings for your Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 400 or Raspberry Pi 3.</p>



<p><em>(More Raspberry Pi models will follow if users ask for them!)</em></p>



<p>Please be sure to read through the entire page before applying the settings to your Raspberry Pi – there are also instructions what to do in case your Raspberry Pi will not boot after overclocking (which is a real risk). Also, you’ll need to make sure that the settings are long-term stable, and that your Raspberry Pi has adequate cooling. </p>



<blockquote><p>Quick tip: “poor man’s cooling”: turn your Raspberry Pi so that it sits vertically – on a Pi 4, the ARM Cortex-A72 CPU will be able to dissipate more heat this way, simply due to physics.</p><cite>cool cooling hack</cite></blockquote>



<p>Follow these step-for-step instructions to use this tool:</p>



<h3> Step 1: choose your Raspberry Pi Model </h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="773" height="434" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117.png" alt="Select your Raspberry Pi Model in the interactive overclocking tool" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117.png 773w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117-300x168.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px"><figcaption>The screenshot shows the choice of different Raspberry Pi models built into this Raspberry Pi Overclocking Tool</figcaption></figure>



<p>Select the appropriate Raspberry Pi model you would like to overclock, and click on “<strong>Next Step</strong>“. Note, Raspberry Pi 3B is the Raspberry Pi 3B – we currently do not support overclocking Raspberry Pi 3B+ (see below for the reason). </p>



<h3>Step 2: choose overclock preset</h3>



<p>You have a choice between “medium booster” and “maximum performance”. </p>



<p>Be sure to provide adequate cooling to your Raspberry Pi, especially with “maximum performance” – when it overheats, the Raspberry Pi will reduce the clock frequency to protect the circuitry!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="801" height="504" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118.png" alt="two different overclock presets for your Raspberry Pi - medium booster and maximum performance" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118.png 801w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118-300x189.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118-768x483.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px"><figcaption>your choice of overclock presets in this Raspberry Pi overclocking tool</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can see, we recommend to use at least a heatsink (or <a href="https://buyzero.de/products/flirc-gehause-fur-raspberry-pi-4?variant=31142645891174">FLIRC case</a>) for medium booster, and <a href="https://buyzero.de/products/fan-shim-fur-raspberry-pi-4-aktive-kuhlung?variant=29434389332070">active cooling</a> for maximum performance.  </p>



<p>Click on “<strong>Next Step</strong>“, to see the results.</p>



<h3>Step 3 Download or copy preset</h3>

<p>You will see a result screen. In case you have selected the maximum performance overclocking preset, you’ll also have to acknowledge that the preset <strong>will void your warranty</strong> by setting a special bit inside your Raspberry Pi:</p>

<p>Tick the checkmark box to access the preset in this case. <strong>In case you are worried about your warranty, we recommend to try the medium overclock preset instead.</strong></p>



<p>Using the button “<strong>Copy to clipboard</strong>“, you can copy the preset to your computer’s clipboard. Alternatively, you can also click on “<strong>Download</strong>” to download the overclock preset as a text file.</p>

<h3>Step 4 add your new overclock settings to your Raspberry Pi’s config.txt</h3>



<p>You’ll have to add these new settings to your Raspberry Pi to actually overclock it.</p>



<p>Edit config.txt for this purpose, and paste these lines at the bottom. Here is an example, using the command line editor nano:</p>



<pre>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="716" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-1024x716.png" alt="/boot/config.txt being edited as root user, to enable overclocking (note overclocking settings at the bottom of the file)" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-1024x716.png 1024w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-300x210.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-768x537.png 768w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124.png 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>medium overclock settings for Raspberry Pi 4 in /boot/config.txt</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote><p>Note: the overclock settings should be below an<strong> [all]</strong> statement, or – even better – below the appropriate selector for your Raspberry Pi, e.g. <strong>[pi4]</strong>. This way, if you share the microSD card between your Pis, the overclocking settings will only be applied to a Pi which can actually use them.  In the screenshot, I’ve pasted the overclocking settings at the end of the file, they are applied to [all] pis.</p><cite>the devil is in the detail</cite></blockquote>



<p>Alternatively, you can also put the overclock.txt in the same folder as the config.txt (FAT partition “boot”, topmost folder), and include it by adding the following line into config.txt:</p>



<pre>include overclock.txt</pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="685" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-1024x685.png" alt="overclock.txt is being included from the main boot configuration file config.txt" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-1024x685.png 1024w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-300x201.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-768x514.png 768w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125.png 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>including an overclock settings file from the main config.txt boot configuration file</figcaption></figure>



<p>This way, you can keep your settings apart (or even create both medium and high overclocking settings, and switch between them by editing the <em>include </em>line.)</p>



<h3>Step 5 Reboot your Raspberry Pi</h3>



<p>Now your overclocking settings should be applied, and you should feel that the system is snappier &amp; reacts faster. </p>



<p>Stress-test your Raspberry Pi, to see if it will perform appropriately with the new settings! Especially with the maximum overclocking settings, there might be instability or even problems booting your Raspberry Pi – not all Raspberry Pi silicon chips are built alike, and while the stock clock speed settings will work for every Pi, your results might vary when overclocking. </p>



<h2>Monitoring the overclocking stability using PiCockpit</h2>



<p><a href="https://picockpit.com/">PiCockpit </a>is a remote Raspberry Pi monitoring &amp; control web interface. You can add up to five Raspberry Pis free of charge to it.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://picockpit.com/">PiCockpit</a>, you can monitor important statistics, relevant for overclocking – like CPU load, and SoC temperature. Use the app <a href="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/pistats-live-raspberry-pi-statistics/">PiStats </a>for this purpose: </p>



<figure><a href="https://picockpit.com/"><img loading="lazy" width="722" height="912" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pistats.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pistats.jpg 722w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pistats-238x300.jpg 238w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></a><figcaption>PiStats shows you a broad range of information for your Raspberry Pi, including the temperature of your CPU (called SoC temperature here), and the CPU load – important for overclocking!</figcaption></figure>



<p> Another very valuable app is <a href="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/pidoctor-raspberry-pi-system-health-monitor/">PiDoctor</a>, which allows you to run health checks on your Raspberry Pi. In PiDoctor’s system module, you’ll see the SoC temperature, the current CPU frequency and voltage (showing you whether your overclocking settings are applied correctly, or if the Pi is operating at reduced speed, as in the screenshot below): </p>



<figure><a href="https://picockpit.com/"><img loading="lazy" width="689" height="935" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/system-throttling-armfrequency-cap-currentlyactive-freq1GHz.jpg" alt="PiDoctor system module shows you vital statistics related to your Raspberry Pi overclocking: the current CPU frequency, the current CPU voltage, the SoC (=CPU) temperature, soft temperature limit, arm frequency cap, throttling, under-voltage." srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/system-throttling-armfrequency-cap-currentlyactive-freq1GHz.jpg 689w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/system-throttling-armfrequency-cap-currentlyactive-freq1GHz-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px"></a><figcaption>The Raspberry Pi in this screenshot is running at lower frequency, due to over temperature (ARM frequency cap is hit)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It will also show you, whether your power supply is too weak (under-voltage). A power supply which might be just good enough for normal operation might not “cut” it anymore for overclocking, since a faster CPU will draw more power. </p>

<h2>Testing your overclocking settings</h2>



<p>It is important to test how stable your Raspberry Pi overclocking settings are. </p>



<h3>Testing memory stability</h3>



<p>You can test your Raspberry Pi’s memory using memtester:</p>



<pre>sudo apt-get update<br>sudo apt-get install memtester</pre>



<p>Then run memtester as appropriate for your memory size:</p>



<pre>memtester 1024M</pre>



<p><em>(Note: on 32bit systems, you can only access up to 4095M of RAM from a single application, 4096 will fail with “memory argument too large”)</em>.<em> In the case of the Pi 4 / 8 GB you probably should test with a 64bit OS.</em></p>



<p>memtester will try to reserve up to this amount of memory, and test the actual maximum amount it will get from the operating system. </p>



<p>Note: the amount of memory will always be lower than the total specified, due to the operating system requiring some memory, and also due to the VideoCore having some memory reserved entirely for it.</p>



<h3>Linpack</h3>



<p>Linpack is a mathematical test, loading your Raspberry Pi’s CPU cores with solving linear equations. </p>



<p><em>Note: even on stock Raspberry Pi clock settings, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=139712">Linpack might lead to instability (as observed with the Pi 3)</a> – some users used over_voltage to fix this problem, see below.</em></p>



<p><strong>Work in progress – instructions below may not work!</strong></p>



<p>The following instructions are for <strong>Pi 3</strong>, on 32 bit OSes: Download the binary, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=139712#p926798">provided by Professor Weaver here</a>, and install the necessary libraries.</p>



<pre>mkdir ~/linpack
cd ~/linpack
wget http://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/junk/pi3_hpl.tar.gz
tar -xzf pi3_hpl.tar.gz
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gfortran libmpich-dev</pre>



<p><em>Note: Currently I get a segmentation fault trying to start <strong>xhpl</strong>. </em></p>



<h3>CPU Burn</h3>



<p>Use <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=220236#p1355805">these instructions from jahboater in the Raspberry Pi Forums to run cpuburn</a>:</p>



<pre>mkdir ~/cpuburn
cd ~/cpuburn
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssvb/cpuburn-arm/master/cpuburn-a53.S 
gcc -o cpuburn-a53 cpuburn-a53.S 
./cpuburn-a53</pre>



<p>This uses NEON instructions (arithmetics) to put your CPU cores under load. The Raspberry Pi should heat up quickly (when not cooled appropriately). According to jahboater, if your overclock settings cannot run this for an hour, they fail and you should continue to tweak them.  </p>



<h2>FAQ</h2>



<h3>How do I disable overclocking if my Pi does not boot?</h3>



<p>When overclocking, there is a risk of your Raspberry Pi not booting. “Not all silicon is created equal” – there are tolerances in manufacturing. The stock settings will account for these tolerances, with overclocking you can find the maximum settings your Pi will perform at.</p>



<p>In case your Raspberry Pi doesn’t boot after applying the overclock settings, hold down the <strong>SHIFT key </strong>on your keyboard during the next boot. This will disable overclocking – you can boot into your system and adjust (or permanently disable) the overclocking. </p>



<h2>Which applications will benefit from overclocking?</h2>



<p>Typical applications which require a lot of processing power usually include web-browsing, compiling, games.</p>



<h2>What does overclocking actually mean / what does it do?</h2>



<p> The Raspberry Pi’s SoC, which includes the CPU, consists of many millions of transistors. These transistors need to be synchronized with each other, in order to be able to “move in unison”. A common clock speed is applied to this – the clock “ticks” are like commands to little soldiers: “move”, “hold”, “move”, etc. They mark the transition between operating states (for example individual commands being executed on the CPU). This is a gross oversimplification, to give you a rough idea of what is happening. </p>



<p>With overclocking, we ask these transistors to do their work in less time – to switch faster …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div>

			<p>In school, we are first taught the arithmetic mean, then later the geometric mean, and maybe one or two others like the harmonic/contraharmonic mean.</p>
<p>But most teachers do not teach the logic or derivation behind these means. They merely provide the formulas and perhaps provide some scenarios where each mean would be more useful than the others.</p>
<p>I’d like to illustrate the definition of a mean, in the most abstract sense, from a programmer’s perspective, an algorithmic point of view.</p>
<h2>A Balancing Act</h2>
<hr>
<p>Suppose we have a list of N numbers, and a binary operation $f(a,b)$</p>
<p>If we apply that binary operation to one number from the list, we must&nbsp;apply its inverse operation to another number from the list.</p>
<p>We can continue applying $f$ to one element then $f^{-1}$ to another element as many times as we need to, until every number in the list is equal. That number that all elements are equal to…is the mean!</p>
<p>Means are just balancing acts!</p>
<p>** I am aware we haven’t specified the most&nbsp;optimized way to perform this algorithm to ensure it halts.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>let our list be $(2,4,6)$ and our $f(a,b)=a+b$</p>
<p>then we apply the operation and its inverse to two elements respectively:</p>
<p>$(f(2,2), 4 ,f^{-1}(6,2)) = (2+2, 4 ,6-2) =&nbsp;(4,4,4)$</p>
<p>So our mean is 4.&nbsp;We just performed the&nbsp;<em>arithmetic mean</em>!</p>

<h2>What is it good for?</h2>
<hr>
<p>Well, given ANY invertible&nbsp;symmetric binary function, we can define a mean and derive its “shortcut” formula!</p>
<p>Here are the functions that define the means we usually come across:</p>
<p>arithmetic mean: $f(a,b) = a+b$<br>
geometric mean: $f(a,b) = ab$<br>
geometric mean (alternative definition): $f(a,b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$<br>
harmonic mean: $f(a,b) = 1/(1/a + 1/b)$</p>

<h2>Favoring Large or Small Numbers</h2>
<hr>
<p>Now, most of us learn that geometric mean tends to favor smaller&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>For example, the arithmetic mean of 1&nbsp;and 100 is $50\frac{1}{2}$. But the geometric mean of 1 and 100 is 10.</p>
<p>Knowing what we do now, can we create a mean that favors smaller numbers&nbsp;even more?</p>
<p>I don’t know if these already exist in the formal mathematics universe, ie. books or published papers. So let me know if you find a previous name for them!</p>
<p>Franken-mean: $f(a,b) = a^b b^a$</p>
<p>Franken-mean v2: $f(a,b) = a^b + b^a$</p>
<p>You might ask if we can skew our mean toward smaller numbers&nbsp;even more than our above exponential mean. We sure can. Using something called Tetration, simply put – it is iterated exponentiation. There are even operations that encompass iterated tetration and so on…these kind of operations are called&nbsp;hyperoperations. So we can make a mean skewed toward lows or highs as much as we want, and it’s beautiful isn’t it? Before different means are taught, the theory of what defines a mean should really be taught.</p>
<p>But before I forget,&nbsp;you must be saying: “Where’s my shortcut formulas?!!”</p>
<p>Okay okay.</p>

<h2>Deriving the Closed Formulas</h2>
<hr>
<p>Let’s derive the arithmetic mean first. Assume we have a list of 4 elements, ${x,y,z,t}$</p>
<p>Given the binary symmetric&nbsp;function that defines the arithmetic mean $f(a,b)=a+b$,</p>
<p>we let $g(a) = f(a,f(a,f(a,a))) = a + a + a + a = 4a$</p>
<p>Our formula for the mean of the 4 numbers in our list will be:</p>
<p>$g^{-1}(f(x,f(y,f(z,t))))$</p>
<p>We know $g(a) = 4a$, so $g^{-1}(a) = a/4$</p>
<p>That means our mean is $(x+y+z+t)/4$, which is what we expected from the arithmetic mean</p>
<p>Above was just a demonstration for a fixed size list of 4 elements. The concept is the same for any sized list. We can use induction to extrapolate what the formula will be for a list of n&nbsp;elements, $(x+y+z+t…….+w)/n$</p>

<h2>Mathematica code for the generalized mean</h2>
<hr>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
InverseFunction[
(Fold[f, ConstantArray[#, Length[l]]]) &amp;
] [Fold[f, l]]
);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x,y,z,t},(#+#2)&amp;]
Out= 1/4 (t+x+y+z)</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Geometric Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (#*#2) &amp;]
Out= (t x y z)^(1/4)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Harmonic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (1/(1/# + 1/#2)) &amp;]
Out= 4/(1/t + 1/x + 1/y + 1/z)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Franken Mean v1
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y}, (#^#2 * #2^#) &amp;]
Out= Log[x^y y^x]/(2 ProductLog[1/2 Log[x^y y^x]])
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to use 2 variables for the above, because Mathematica’s symbolic inverses aren’t strong enough.<br>
Franken Mean v2 does not even compute with symbolics or even numbers.<br>
I will eventually work on this to hopefully get at least numerics to work nomatter what.</p>
<h2>Alternative Implementation</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is an alternative implementation which seems to yield better results in some cases:</p>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
Module[{x},
Solve[Fold[f, l] == Fold[f, ConstantArray[x, Length[l]]], x][[-1,
1, 2]]
]);
</code></pre>

<h2>Create your own means!</h2>
<hr>
<p>Enjoy creating your own means! Number theoretic means on lists of primes and that sort of stuff should be very interesting to explore, cheers!</p>

<p>Kolmogorov actually did something similar and came up with what’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-arithmetic_mean">Generalized f-mean</a></p>
<p>But he restricted his construct to only functions of the form $f(a,b) = g(a) + g(b)$, where g is the function that determines the mean and is to be specified.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<h4>Winter Weather</h4>
<p>As I wrote in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting the Grid</em></a>, the quest for reliable electricity in the winter in New England is far more difficult than it needs to be. The root of the problem is the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) rules for areas like New England. This area is organized on the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=790">RTO system</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;and the FERC rules for RTOs are not particularly concerned with reliable electricity. &nbsp;The rules are very concerned with “fuel neutrality.” In other words, it doesn’t seem to matter if we have rolling blackouts in winter in New England, as long as the rules that <em>led</em> to the rolling blackouts were fair to everyone. The rules especially have to be fair to all the different types of fuels and generators.</p>
<p>Of course, “fair to everyone” is in the eyes of the beholder.</p>
<h4>Local Attempts to Encourage Winter Reliability, Despite FERC</h4>
<p>I document many of the RTO winter problems in <em>Shorting the Grid</em>. ISO-NE, our grid operator, set up the early Winter Reliability Programs. These programs worked well to provide reliability for the grid by making sure gas-fired plants had oil on hand when they couldn’t obtain gas on cold days. Then FERC shut down that program as not being fuel-neutral. In response, ISO-NE suggested a complex formula of fines and rewards, Pay for Performance, to substitute for the Winter Reliability Program. It was approved by FERC, but it failed, financially, within four months of being implemented. &nbsp;Then came the Inventoried Energy plan. &nbsp;That got implemented, on top of the Pay for Performance plans. &nbsp;Next, ISO suggested three new auctions which I reviewed in my book, and I said they would not work. As it happens, these three auctions did not get formally presented to FERC.</p>
<p>Now we get beyond the material presented in <em>Shorting the Grid</em>, because books have a lag time to publication. After ISO-NE set aside the three auctions reviewed in my book, ISO-NE proposed <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/iso-ne-commits-to-address-regional-energy-security-challenges-as-ferc-rejec/588616/?fbclid=IwAR3nrqCXvC9IDbkcFqq2alaXrfCxRTqvJJpKObQP2Wdq5jaJDF10FRDn4sY">three differerent new auctions</a> for FERC approval. &nbsp;Those auction plans were turned down by FERC on October 31 of this year. In the most recent news,<a href="https://rtoinsider.com/iso-ne-to-ferc-fuel-security-179295/"> ISO-NE is asking FERC</a> for guidance in setting up a program which will <em>meet</em> FERC’s fuel-neutral criteria, and still <em>provide</em> reliable electricity in winter in the Northeast. &nbsp;If such a thing can actually be done.</p>
<h4>What Kind of Rock?</h4>
<p>In other words, since FERC seems to turn down any ISO-NE program that might work, maybe FERC can suggest a program? A friend of mine who is retired from the Navy suggested that FERC has been giving orders that are the equivalent of “Get me a rock.” What kind of rock? How big? Round or jagged? Those issues aren’t addressed. As far as I can tell, leadership training in the Navy includes “Don’t give ‘get me a rock’ orders.” Maybe FERC needs a little training?</p>
<p>Despite the lag time required by book publication, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting</em></a> is still basically up to date. This latest three-auction go-around was predictable to anyone who read my book. The RTO system can’t solve even simple problems of reliability, which is how I started the tale of <em>Shorting</em>, and where I will end this blog post.</p>
<hr>
<p>The great thing about a blog post is that people can comment and start a conversation. Often, I learn important things from my readers.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting the Grid</em></a>, let me encourage you to buy it. If you have read it, let me encourage you to leave a review on Amazon. Amazon decides which books to feature based on the number of reviews, or so I am told. Your review is a sort of gift to me. Thank you.</p>

<p>I want to be notified about new real estate ads from my neighborhood.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a popular real estate ads portal I currently check every now and then to get the “feel” of the market I’m interested in. I want to <em>outsource</em> the checking to a bot and be notified about new ads.</li>
  <li>This is for curiosity and to track price trends. I don’t need to know about every new ad. I’m interested only in ads matching certain criteria. I don’t need to be notified right away — once a day, maybe even once a week is OK.</li>
  <li>This is a hobby project, hosting price, educational value, and developer happiness are important and legitimate concerns for the solution 😀</li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write a telegram bot to scrape the ads portal and send notifications about new ads matching the given criteria.</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I use telegram for some group chats and it’s already present on my phone.</li>
      <li>It has a nice <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api" title="Telegram Bot API">bot API</a>.</li>
      <li>A user/bot can mark messages they send as <em>silent</em> so they don’t distract the recipient.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write the bot with go.</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I’m involved in some go projects at work, and I feel quite productive with the language.</li>
      <li>Small backend services are the sweet spot for go.</li>
      <li>I’ve contributed to some go projects, but starting from scratch is a different game. I’ve wanted to practice that.
        <ul>
          <li>I’ve ignored <a href="https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api">go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api</a>. Writing the API model from scratch is a bit of work, but I wanted to do that for educational purposes (see <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-reinvent-the-wheel-unless-you-plan-on-learning-more-about-wheels/"><em>Don’t Reinvent The Wheel, Unless You Plan on Learning More About Wheels</em></a>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Host the bot on Google App Engine (GAE) in the Google Cloud (GCP).</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I don’t want to run the bot on my laptop, and I don’t want to maintain the server at home. We need to go to the CLOUD! 🌥
        <ul>
          <li>Of course, we can also host a VM on digital ocean (or somewhere similar) for $5 / month ;).
            <ul>
              <li>Sidenote: If you want to try digital ocean <a href="https://m.do.co/c/649b18bb5e59">my ref link</a> will give you $100 credits to start (over 60 days; and $25 for me).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I wanted to use a managed solution though, mostly to avoid maintenance work on the project as much as possible.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Why Google App Engine and not Heroku, or Azure/AWS equivalents?
        <ul>
          <li>Mostly to get more hands-on experience with GCP.</li>
          <li>They have a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free" title="GCP free tier">generous free tier</a> and I expect my use case to fit into the limits and cost me $0 / month (or close to it).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-not-open-source-the-code">Why not open-source the code?</h2>

<p>Because of the website I’m scraping. The laws on the subject are complex, scraping for personal purposes is different than showing the public how to do it. I don’t want to go through the hassle of figuring it out in the major jurisdictions. I could take out the scraping part and open-source the rest, but for now, I’m not willing to put more personal time into the project.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll find the notes useful regardless!</p>



<h2 id="telegram-bot-api-is-really-good-for-experimentation">Telegram bot API is really good for experimentation</h2>

<p>The docs are really good and easy to work with. There’s no tutorial, so I recommend to use VS code + <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client">REST client extension</a> to experiment. This is useful later on when you try to debug or understand the API a bit better. The REST client gives us a nice, interactive, almost REPL like dev-experience.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Talk to <em>BothFather</em> on telegram to create a new bot: <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot">[docs]</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start with the following requests:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>@token = token-from-botfather
@root = https://api.telegram.org/bot


### Info
GET /getMe


### Get new messages sent to the bot
GET /getUpdates


### Respond back to a chat
@chat_id = numeric-chat-id
POST /sendMessage?chat_id=&amp;text=Hello


### Check webhook status
GET /getWebhookInfo
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-telegram-bot-api-experiments.png" alt="VS code REST client session example"></p>

<h3 id="anyone-can-chat-to-your-bot">Anyone can chat to your bot</h3>

<p>You may want some form of authentication before allowing telegram users to use all the bot features. In my case, I ask for a user token in order for the bot to notify you about new ads.</p>

<h2 id="google-app-engine">Google App Engine</h2>

<p>I’ve really enjoyed working with the platform. There’s a learning curve, but there’s not a lot of complexity if you think about it as a docker container runner :)</p>

<h3 id="secrets-are-hard-to-manage">Secrets are hard to manage</h3>

<p>As a responsible <a href="https://12factor.net/config">twelve-factor app</a> citizen you want to provide the config, including secrets, via environment variables. On GAE you put them in <code>app.yaml</code> file. The problem is that you can’t keep the file plaintext in your repo — everyone with access to the code will be able to access the secrets as well.</p>

<p>See, e.g.  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/sending-messages">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/sending-messages</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add the key to the environment variables section in your app’s&nbsp;app.yaml</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that anyone with access to your app.yaml will also have access to your API keys. If you can’t store app.yaml in a secure location, we recommend you store the API keys in a secure location such as Datastore and retrieve the keys at runtime, or keep the keys in your code but encrypt them with a keystore, such as Cloud Key Management Service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a far cry from the ease of adding “secret” env variables in other services. E.g. adding secrets to GitHub Actions is just a few clicks in the UI.</p>

<p>The alternative is to use something like <a href="https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/">gitcrypt</a> to transparently encrypt the file in your repo.</p>

<p>Remember, we talk about a personal time hobby project, not an <em>enterprise</em> deployment where secret management is likely a solved problem.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-dont-know-gae-start-with-the-concepts">If you don’t know GAE start with the <em>concepts</em></h3>

<p>See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/concepts, especially the <em>How Instances are Managed</em> section.</p>

<h3 id="run-it-for-cheap-">Run it for cheap :)</h3>

<p><strong>Note</strong> when I comment on pricing in this article it is based on my understanding of the GCP price model. Cloud pricing models are notoriously complex — do your own research, utilize the GCP trial to figure out the costs of your project. Don’t blindly follow the advice of some random-person-on-the-internet.</p>

<p>At the time of writing GAE free tier looks like this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free" title="GCP free tier">[src]</a>:</p>
<pre><code>- 28 hours per day of "F" instances
- 9 hours per day of "B" instances
- 1 GB of egress per day
- The Free Tier is available only for the Standard Environment
</code></pre>

<p>Put something like this in the <code>app.yaml</code> config file to stay within the limits:</p>
<pre><code>instance_class: F1
automatic_scaling:
  max_instances: 1
</code></pre>

<h3 id="old-versions-of-the-app-may-be-still-running">Old versions of the app may be still running</h3>

<p>When you do <code>gcloud app deploy</code> GCP build and deploys new version of your app. The problem is that the old versions may be still running. Unless you do traffic splitting they probably get 0 traffic, but they may serve existing connections, or they may do some operations in the background. Keep that in mind, delete the old versions when you don’t need them (and avoid async operations, GAE is not designed for that, see <a href="#go-concurrency-patterns-are-not-that-useful"><em>Go concurrency patterns are not that useful</em></a> section).</p>

<p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-gae-old-versions-still-running.png" alt="Old versions still running"></p>

<h3 id="the-app-is-not-guaranteed-to-scale-up-from-0-to-1-after-deployment">The app is not guaranteed to scale up from 0 to 1 after deployment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Watch out for any init actions — your app may not be started until it gets the first request.</li>
  <li>If there are 0 instances pre-deployment, google may keep it a 0 post-deployment.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_states">docs say that an instance is always running</a>, but I don’t think that’s the case:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>An instance of an auto-scaled service is always running. However, an instance of a manual or basic scaled service can be either running or stopped.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-0-instances-runnning.png" alt="No instances running"></p>

  <p>Each time you deploy a new version, a container image is created using the Cloud Build service. That container image then runs in the App Engine standard environment. (…) Once deployment is complete, App Engine no longer needs the container images. Note that they are not automatically deleted, so to avoid reaching your storage quota, you can safely delete any images you don’t need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The images are stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Actually, I’ve noticed that GCP created two new buckets, one of them had a 15d lifecycle policy attached, but the other not.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Logs: there’s a generous 50GB / project free tier for logs as long as you stay within the default retention period (30 days). See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing">[pricing]</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traces to profile the app.</p>

    <p>As you can see on the screenshot there’s not that much to my app. You can see the histogram, with long-running requests easily distinguishable over the 1000 ms line. It’s not that I have 5-sec behemoths in the bot, but rather there were 0 instances, and GCP needed to start one for me to serve the request.</p>

    <p>I’m not sure how useful this is for a small personal “app” but it doesn’t hurt to have it, you can easily eyeball if there’s anything that takes longer than expected.</p>

    <p>Debugger</p>

    <p>The debugger is really amazing on paper, but I couldn’t get it to work. Based on the docs it is not available for Go in GAE <a href="https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/setup/go">[src]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-the-app">Structuring the app</h2>

<h3 id="go-concurrency-patterns-are-not-that-useful">Go concurrency patterns are not that useful</h3>

<p>Due to autoscaling our app may be scaled-down anytime when it is not servicing requests. This means that we can’t rely on goroutines (and channels) to complete operations in the background.</p>

<p>A GAE app should be based on the request-response model. It gets a request, does the processing, and responds to the request.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we prefer to respond to customer requests right away and queue the heavy lifting for async processing (see <a href="https://decafbad.com/blog/2008/07/04/queue-everything-and-delight-everyone/"><em>Queue everything and delight everyone</em></a>).</p>

<p>GCP provides us with primitives to compensate the lack of async processing. We can use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/dual-overview"><em>task queues</em></a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/scheduling-jobs-with-cron-yaml"><em>cron jobs</em></a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Writing as a medium</h2>
<p>I never have even in my wildest dream thought of what it meant to write.
I have always thought that writing is nothing more than putting together some useful information for an article. Or that writing is just a way to express yourself.</p>
<p>Basically, I have though in clingy cliches. </p>
<p>That was the main reason that I have never considered writing as a side thing that I wanted to do. Writing has always been reserved in my mind for those that went and did linguistics, English language or history in the university.</p>
<p>I have always been put together with mathematicians and scientists. After all, I went to study economics at University. Even though it did involve some essays, most of it was about mathematics and statistics.</p>
<p>So, can you imagined how I was surprised when I have seen countless people pick up writing and start blogging and journaling?</p>
<p>I asked them, “Why not Instagram with images and videos? Why not YouTube with full vlogs?” At that point, I had no idea what they were doing and why.</p>
<p>At that point in my life, I preferred content in video formats, maybe because I understood it better, or maybe because I thought that only the best-written content would be made into a video. So that is the reason why I was shocked when they told me also to start writing. “You will understand once you start.” Of course, I completely ignored them.</p>
<p>Now 4 years later and here I am writing for you to consume information in the format that was unavailable to 90% of the population of earth up until 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of writing and blogging, in general, is that it can seamlessly include and format out there organically. It can include photos, videos, sound and text, all together with no real friction.</p>
<p>In any other medium, that is impossible. Videos come close, but if you make people read something for 3 minutes straight on the video, they will get annoyed, and there will be friction.</p>
<p>The other most amazing things about writing is that it has a tremendous benefit to the writer.</p>
<p><img alt="writing with pen" src="https://i.gyazo.com/644a347f76eff5fe417ecd9dfbb00b14.jpg"></p>
<h2>Writing sorts out your thoughts</h2>
<p>If you have never written anything, you wouldn’t understand this, but once you have a topic in mind and you start the writing process, countless thoughts appear in your head. They are all considered and put on to the surface for you to pick. Those thoughts allow you to continue writing and creating the article itself.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and brain, of course, think and process information much faster than we write. Even if you write 300 words per minute. That forces you to choose and pick the best thoughts and ideas available so that the structure is clean and balanced. What ends up happening is that irrelevant and unpicked thoughts get put into the large box that says “Irrelevant” and from then on, whenever the topic in hand gets brought up, only the used thoughts will be used. The box will remain shut.</p>
<p>Not only that, but they will be used exactly like you have written them down.</p>
<p>How is that a benefit? Well, in a word of information overdoes, having a structured thought process and balanced understanding of the topic is very hard. We all know something about everything; in reality, that is useless. Not only it makes us falsely think that we know somethings perfectly, but it also makes us thinks that we know everything perfectly.</p>
<p>Every time a topic gets brought up, our brain first reaction will be to share what we know about it to show off. When you try though to tell what exactly you know, instead of a good understanding, only blobs of some definitions come up. Your explanation barely scratches the surface.</p>
<p>Most of the time, when trying to explain a topic that we are only barely familiar with, our sentence structure is not that good, and we are not able to have logic in them.</p>
<p>Well, what does writing do? <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/being-honest-or-being-successful">It forces you to understand the topic</a> from 0% and at least to 50% of the topic. This allows you actually to know what you are talking about. Once you put something into writing, you have a clear picture of what it is and how it works.</p>
<h2>Writing helps you being creative</h2>
<p>If you have never done writing, you probably won’t understand, but while writing, you will be getting the best creative solutions to all of the problem you have ever had. </p>
<p>If something is <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/quality-over-quantity-in-writing">really bothering you so much that you are not able to do anything;</a> in my opinion, you should get a pen and paper or a text editor and start writing. </p>
<p>The writing doesn’t even have to be about your problem. It can be about anything. You are doing it for the process, not the outcome. You will be surprised, but while writing and being absorbed, you will think of countless solutions to your problem. </p>
<p>Even if you think that creativity is not your strong suit, you would be surprised how much inspiration is surrounding us. A bird that you barely saw on the street can be a head image for the brand that you are working on. A song that you heard on the radio can be the base for your hit of the year. Anything that surfaces in your head while writing is going to be gold, as long as you take and use it.</p>
<p><img alt="laptop and book open for writing" src="https://i.gyazo.com/6392f4a679a6e85f8acb46a5b5bcf0b9.jpg"></p>
<h2>Writing lets you dream</h2>
<p>If you think that dreams are for people that don’t get things done, then I agree with you. But while writing, we all start dreaming just like when we were young. It is a natural process to think about what we want to achieve and where we are going.</p>
<p>Writing not only helps us to understand our goals, but it also helps us get a full plan on how to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Every time I am procrastinating, instead of doing something that obviously will take me further away from my goal, I start writing about what the goal and the task is. What it requires from me to do it. Why I want to do it and the detailed plan of small steps that I have to take. </p>
<p>Let’s look at the example—this blog.</p>
<p>I have barely coded anything in my life before this. If I were told to build this website from scratch straight away, I would have laughed to your face. It was an impossible task for me. How did I do it? </p>
<p>The whole process was broken down into tiny tasks, so small that I actually couldn’t even <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/how-to-succeed-in-life-online-in-2020">procrastinate about them</a>. They were so obvious and easy to do that I could just do them every day, with no exception.</p>
<p>Out of everyday work, something great can develop. Out of this habit came this website and I am to this day very proud of that.</p>
<p>As with everything, many tasks require a long process of doing the task repeatedly. If you are thinking of having a better life, writing can play a major role in that. You don’t have to start huge. Start small. </p>
<p>Write a word, then a sentence and then a paragraph. If you don’t want to continue, no problem, <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/the-world-doesnt-stop-when-you-are-tired">stop</a>. But make sure to come back tomorrow and do the writing again, no less than today. Over time one paragraph will become 2 and then later an article that you could share.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This text is part of: "<i><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">I would never send my kids to school</a></i>" by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2017)</small>
</p>


<h2><span id="Bill_Gates_is_my_hero">Bill Gates is my hero</span></h2>
<p>Bill Gates was an early guiding light and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">our</a> inspiration. When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak" title="Krzysztof Biedalak">Krzysztof Biedalak</a> and I made our first $3 investment in a corporate rubber stamp, which was a post-communist obligation for all companies in Poland in 1991, Microsoft was a multibillion-dollar company. How could we not have been blinded by inspiration? We wanted to write a universally useful piece of software and the world would be ours - we thought. Bill Gates's software philosophy, based on respect for backward compatibility, sheltered <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> on its path to its painfully slow adoption. Software and database compatibility have been preserved for 30 years now. My first pieces of knowledge in medical sciences, typed in on Dec 13, 1987, are still there in my collection, well-memorized and useful. Without Gates and his stance on compatibility, I would have lost all that knowledge to some upgrade hiccup long ago. When Gates moved to philanthropy, he has secured his place on my list of the greatest people who ever walked this planet. Perhaps as many as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_saved_over_100_million_children" title="Bill Gates saved over 100 million children">30-120 million kids have been saved by Bill's foundation</a>. This begs a vital question: Why is Gates so awfully wrong about education? Why does he fall for the same old myth that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_You_can_improve_education_by_throwing_more_money_in_it" title="Myth: You can improve education by throwing more money in it">investing in education will produce better outcomes</a>? The education system is wrong and it must be redesigned. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end" title="Compulsory schooling must end">Compulsory schooling must end</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_Education_Reform" title="Grand Education Reform">Grand Education Reform</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Could_Bill.27s_great_mind_be_wrong.3F">Could Bill's great mind be wrong?</span></h2>
<p>Everyone who disagrees with a great mind needs to pause and re-examine. Gates got sensational credentials. He sports a genius mind. He has seen more places that I could possibly ever manage to visit in Google Maps. He has spoken to more great people than I have had a chance to read about. He has visited more schools that I have seen on pictures. He started his forays into education in 1999. In contrast, I started thinking about "the system" only in 2016 when getting ready to write this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">book</a>. This makes me into a fledgling with an immature point of view. Gates himself is a great example of a brisk student who has turned his skills and talents into a monumental achievement. His credentials are so much better than mine!
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_perspective">Bill Gates's perspective</span></h2>
<p>Could this just be that Gates's perspective is so much different than mine?
</p><p>He looks at the education system like at the operating system. Measure the performance, look for bottlenecks in the system, fix the parameter here and there, videotape a great teacher, and make others copy the method, and manufacture greatness.
</p><p>He looks at education like a philanthropic job. Like he treats health problems with mass vaccinations, he looks for a simple formula which could improve the education of the masses with some industrial move? He seems less focused on letting the brightest thrive, and more focused on preventing the weakest from dropping out. He wants to bring up the average using some <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">standardized testing</a> approach.
</p><p>He looks at education like a big company that needs to be managed effectively with departments, and sub-departments. With a clear division of responsibility. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy#Schooling_is_like_Soviet_Economy" title="Modern schooling is like Soviet economy">With an industrial goal in mind?</a>
</p><p>Could this be that this great capitalist shows more socialist thinking than a little well-indoctrinated ex-communist like myself?
</p><p>There is a different perspective of an employer and an employee, esp. in a creative position. Gates looks at the number of college graduates. I look for specific skills and creative powers. Actual degrees do not matter much if you take time to get into a particular brain.
</p><p>He looks at students like productive workers. The heretic idea of a longer school day must have come from the factory model thinking. Longer days, more production, more manufacturing.
</p><p>He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.
</p><p>Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds "<i>you can't run a society on top 5%</i>". He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.
</p><p>Gates's approach would be great for some poorer countries (e.g. in Africa). Where there are no schools, industrial approach and good management could quickly improve health, eliminate poverty, and provide basic education.
</p><p>My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling. With social awareness and education on the rise, we look for more little future Noble Prize winners and future Bill Gateses.
</p><p>His own kids get the best kind of learning. During his trips around the world, they get to visit places like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This could spark a life-long passion that could turn them into future particle physicists or another incarnation of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.  
</p><p>Where Gates optimizes for improving the average, I am looking for the optimum of peak intellectual performance.
</p><p>Last but not least, could Gates's approach be an afterglow of his dropping out from Harvard. I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Thiel_on_competition_for_degrees" title="Thiel on competition for degrees">the opposite of Peter Thiel</a> who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_formula_for_success">Bill Gates's formula for success</span></h2>
<p>I see Gates's own life as a simple formula for success in science, engineering, or life in general:
</p>
<ul><li> healthy childhood of few concerns (preferably without the relegation to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>)</li>
<li> healthy approach to schooling with pranks, rebellions, disobedience, and freedom </li>
<li> minor trajectory nudges within the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone" title="Push zone">push zone</a> by inspirational tutors. If tutors are not parents, this might be the most expensive part of the formula</li>
<li> breakthrough passion, e.g. for tinkering with computers or software</li>
<li> healthy education, possibly interrupted by some breakthrough decision (e.g. <i>Let me drop out from Harvard to set up the greatest software company in the world</i>)</li>
<li> relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">youthful passion</a></li>
<li> voracious reading (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_and_his_non-incremental_reading" title="Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading">Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading</a>)</li></ul>
<p>Only Bill Gates truly knows it, but my understanding of his life story is that his future was determined by just one major factor: getting his hands on a computer. He was good at math and programming. So are dozens of kids in my neighborhood. My thinking comes from the fact that I was also strongly affected by my first contact with computers.
</p>

<p>When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/First_steps_of_SuperMemo" title="First steps of SuperMemo">I got my first computer in 1986</a>, ZX Spectrum, I was 24 and experienced wild elation with computer's obedience in executing my commands. I told the computer what to do, and it did it perfectly without asking questions. That was wonderful. I started writing my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">program for planning my day</a> on paper long before I got the computer on my desk. I was eager to see it work! As ZX Spectrum would load programs from a cassette tape, I could not easily dream of having <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. It needed access to some disk drive. I got my first PC with a 360 KB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy disk</a> drive only <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_1.0_for_DOS_(1987)" title="SuperMemo 1.0 for DOS (1987)">in 1987</a></p>
<p>The above hypothetical formula for educational success is simple and effective. Only a few might ever dream to replicate the scope of Bill's success. If that formula does not bring serial Nobel Prize winners, it should at least bring up a great deal of happy and fulfilled individuals. Freedom to explore the world is essential and it is denied to a great deal of kids in the modern world. When Peter Thiel pays kids to drop out from college, he looks for this type of free thinking experience that can change one life and then can change the world.
</p>
<h2><span id="My_attempt_at_employing_Gates.27s_formula">My attempt at employing Gates's formula</span></h2>

<p>I am happy with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_adoption_of_spaced_repetition" title="Exponential adoption of spaced repetition">my achievements in life</a>. I have followed the formula employed by Gates. However, there were some exceptions. Perhaps I could use them as an excuse for not being as wildly successful as Bill? I was sent to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>, and I am sure this slowed down my development. The time I spent with my brother was more intellectual and inspirational by two orders of magnitude. However, he was a student and could not babysit the little me for ever. In later years, I was forced into a degree of conformity by an ever-present threat of being enlisted by the army in service of the Warsaw Pact. In 1986, I was finally free of the army service, and could finally drop out, however, I was not ready. There was no market economics culture in Poland of the 1980s. I read about entrepreneurial science in Science in 1989 (Oct 31, 1989). This was the first time when it occurred to me that my research into memory might actually be a seed of a business. Initially, though, my passions led me in the direction of a PhD. Schooling told me that science done by entrepreneurs is inferior to science done in academia. I thought of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> as an opportunity to earn money for a trip to America. It seems that while Gates was fast to mature as a little entrepreneur, I needed 28 long years to even start thinking of my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">own business</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Reconciling_Gates_and_Woz">Reconciling Gates and Woz</span></h2>
<p>Gates wants better teachers, better education, verification, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">testing</a>, measuring, carrot-and-stick for teachers, etc. In contrast, I stand with Steve Jobs. Jobs told the kids to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning" title="Fundamental law of learning">rebel</a>!

        <p>In 2018, I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_pour_l%27informatique_et_les_techniques_avanc%C3%A9es">EPITA</a>, a french engineering “Grande École” specialized in computer science. The subjects I had treated there were very technical: from the implementation of an ISO file reader to a <a href="https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/tiger.html">Tiger compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The technical focus, taught in technical programs such as my engineering school, has led me to some small surprises during my first steps in the business world. The following list outlines what I would have liked to have learned before graduation. The article is obviously influenced by computer science, which is the specialty of my school. Nevertheless, I hope that the students will find some teaching in it, whatever the technical field they are targeting.</p>



<h2 id="human-is-the-new-challenge">Human is the New Challenge</h2>

<p>Coming from a school whose implicit motto was “the more technical, the better”, I had to quickly get used to the idea that the new technicality coming out of school was primarily human. Don’t make me wrong: having technical knowledge is as necessary as expected by the business world. But if many of us have been trained to take up technical challenges, we have been much less prepared for the strangeness of human behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Technical skills should no longer be your challenge, your challenge should now be human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schopenhauer said in The Art of Being Right “<em>A man may be objectively in the right, and nevertheless in the eyes of bystanders, and sometimes in his own, he may come off worst</em>” which in our case could be perfectly translated as “<em>You may be technically right and yet not be supported by others.</em>”. Sometimes engaging technical decisions are taken on the basis of very non-technical arguments, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you were sick on the day of an important meeting;</li>
  <li>your level in English is not good enough to argue well enough;</li>
  <li>your manager used to work at XYZ, therefore XYZ technology is chosen for the project;</li>
  <li>your ambition to change a design frightens the rest of the team, despite the little amount effort it actually requires;</li>
  <li>your colleague X doesn’t like you, therefore it doesn’t like your design;</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list is endless. Just keep in mind that if you want technical decisions to be accepted, you will have to arm yourself with skills that go well beyond technique, starting with <em>negotiation</em> for example.</p>



<p>The school doesn’t just train engineers in languages or tools, it establishes a culture and a discipline that becomes stronger or weaker by joining a firm. Depending on the business sector, company, project or team, not everyone gives the same attention to software engineering. It is very unlikely that this discipline is the core business of your company, nor even the academic background of your colleagues. The good practices, taken for granted, can then be violently disrupted: no code review, no unit tests, sometimes even no version-control tool.</p>

<p>The intuitive reflex of a young engineer is to bring a purely technical solution: no version-control tool? let’s install git! No code review? Let’s protect the master branch! No unit tests? Install the right testing library! Etc. But here we are, the problem is <em>not</em> technical, the problem is primarily human, more particularly cultural. Changing the corporate culture, or more modestly, <em>the culture of a team is far more difficult to change than any tool</em>.</p>

<p>I will always remember the long struggle to get GitLab for an old project. This was the kind of indispensable work tool for a software engineer. The battle was long, not because the tool did not exist (it just had to be downloaded and installed) but because the required culture was not ready.</p>

<p>It takes time and effort to change a culture, but it is well worth the effort. A tool can always be dropped, a <code>git push</code> can always be forced, but a disciplined team is hardly swindled. So when choosing between a very well equipped team and a very disciplined team, <em>choose discipline without hesitation</em>!</p>

<h2 id="professional--genius">Professional &gt; Genius</h2>

<p>In university, a lot of credit was given to geniuses who, alone, could compile a few thousand lines of complicated code in a single night’s work. When I entered the business world, my vision changed a lot from that kind of profile, capable of doing a lot of work in record time. Their confidence (or arrogance) leads to an extra commitment, which makes it difficult to meet delivery deadlines. And because geniuses understand complex things, they <a href="https://reflexio.debec.eu/principles-for-better-design#keep-it-simple-stupid">design complex systems</a> that no one understands. Their loneliness makes them unique masters of their subjects, thereby nurturing their self-esteem. Knowledge remains in their heads and their presence becomes necessary for every decision.</p>

<p><a href="https://armament.solutions/tactics/single-points-of-failure.html"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/single_point_of_failure.svg" alt="Single point of failure"></a></p>

<p>But geniuses also have 24-hour days and quickly turn out to be the <em>bottleneck</em> of everything, slowing down everyone else. You don’t need to be a software architecture expert to agree that it is not desirable to over-commit and underestimate a single resource: apart from the inability to scale, the resource is the single point of failure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">The design of a single point of failure is unforgivable</a>. Once the engineer gets sick, goes on vacation, or leaves the company, the entire team will have to pay back months or even years of unprofessionalism.</p>

<p>It is a black and exaggerated portrait that I paint here. I can nevertheless bet that you will encounter this kind of profile in your career which, in addition to having a negative impact on entire projects (and on people’s health), will sometimes be claimed as a hero by the organization. <em>Real geniuses are the geniuses also capable of <a href="https://reflexio.debec.eu/principles-for-better-design#keep-it-simple-stupid">designing simplicity</a>, taking people on board while humble towards humanity and their workload</em>. These are called great professionals. They spread knowledge and responsibility in order to become not the single point of failure or the bottle neck.</p>

  <p>Geniuses build scalable services, professionals are scalable geniuses. - <a href="https://twitter.com/arnaud_debec/status/1327584444849524736">Twitter</a></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>This post was co-authored with <a href="https://twitter.com/ChipkinLogan">Logan Chipkin</a>.</em></p>

<p>Some responses to the most common criticisms of and questions about libertarianism. To reference, click on a heading. Feel free to share.</p>

<p>There’s a glossary at the bottom.</p>

<h3><a href="#who-would-build-roads" name="who-would-build-roads">Who would build roads if there was no government?</a></h3>

<p>The same people who build them now, only they’d be paid directly by those who actually use them. When the government owns the roads, all taxpayers bear the burden, even if they’d prefer not to consume the roads. This results in overconsumption of roads, since consumption has been forcibly severed from payment by the consumer. This is a special case of the more general tragedy of the commons that results from government illegitimately claiming ownership of some good or service that the government offers for public consumption.</p>

<h3><a href="#how-would-you-settle-disputes" name="how-would-you-settle-disputes">How would you settle disputes between people? In other words: how would the legal system work?</a></h3>

<p>It’s worth noting that citizens under different national governments already settle disputes with each other, and there is not (yet) a global government. So, people have already solved the problem of how to settle disputes despite being subject to different systems of law (coercively).</p>

<p>Secondly, despite the government’s imposed monopoly on legislation and its system of courts that cannot possibly go out of business no matter how much people do not want to purchase its services, people <em>still</em> find private alternatives (namely, out-of-court dealings and private arbitration services) to resolve their conflicts.</p>

<p>In an anarcho-capitalist society, a company can only earn a profit by persuading people to purchase its goods or services. In this case, the service that people want is reliable adjudication between interpersonal disputes. If two parties find themselves in a conflict that they cannot privately resolve, they may shop around for a court that both parties find fair and cost-effective.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the parties may have purchased insurance that covers whatever conflict they now find themselves in. In that case, the insurance agencies, if different, have an interest in resolving the dispute such that both of their reputations remain intact. Should either insurance agency refuse to pay out/cover the damages, no one would trust them enough to do business with them ever again.</p>

<p>Depending on how developed the economy is, these insurance agencies may have predetermined agreements with each other about which court to which they will present their clients’ disputes.</p>

<h3><a href="#what-about-the-police" name="what-about-the-police">What about the police?</a></h3>

<p>People could purchase private security.</p>

<h3><a href="#the-poor-could-not-call-the-police" name="the-poor-could-not-call-the-police">So the poor couldn’t call the police?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, they could. There could be charity, support networks, credit, etc. Also, free-market security companies have incentives to be much cheaper than the police, because they can go bankrupt, whereas the police can’t. Ironically, poor neighborhoods are often chronically underserved by the police already, whereas private security companies could enter such neighborhoods by offering low prices.</p>

<p>Shoes are a good free-market example. Virtually everyone needs them, and poor people do not struggle to purchase them. The same mechanisms of innovation and competition would yield affordable and quality security services to them, as well.</p>

<h3><a href="#healthcare" name="healthcare">What about healthcare?</a></h3>

<p>See police.</p>

<h3><a href="#foreign-invaders" name="foreign-invaders">What about foreign invaders?</a></h3>

<p>Eventually, private security and insurance.</p>

<h3><a href="#move-to-somalia" name="move-to-somalia">Why don’t you just move to Somalia?</a></h3>

<p>This is a silly suggestion that people like to make, implying that a libertarian society would be a lawless society. But that’s just not the case. Libertarians want rules, and consequences for those who break them. What libertarians don’t want is to be subjected to coercion. The rejection of coercion does not imply the rejection of rules.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is more to civilization than the size of government. The culture of a civilization and its level of wealth are at least as important with respect to its ability to correct errors and allow for progress.</p>

<p>Finally, mankind was born into utter poverty: at the dawn of our species, life really was ‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’. So it is the existence of wealth that requires explanation, not poverty. Why is the United States wealthier than it was one-hundred years ago? Was wealth created by the growth of its government? Similarly, would Somalia become wealthier if some of them coercively acquired wealth from the rest of them?</p>

<h3><a href="#theft-and-murder" name="theft-and-murder">If there’s no force/coercion, doesn’t that mean people would be free to steal and commit murder?</a></h3>

<p>No. A libertarian society would still punish crimes. There is a difference between the initiation of force and the use of force in defense against those who initiate force. A libertarian society, by definition, would not tolerate any initiation of force, but the use of force in defense would be allowed. Therefore, crimes would still be investigated and prosecuted. There wouldn’t be <em>no</em> force at all.</p>

<h3><a href="#isnt-capitalism-evil" name="isnt-capitalism-evil">Isn’t capitalism evil?</a></h3>

<p>Capitalism just means that people who want to work together voluntarily get to do so unhindered, and that those who want to be left alone are, in fact, left alone. There’s nothing evil about that. What <em>is</em> evil is when a parasite like the government mooches off of that peaceful interaction.</p>

<h3><a href="#doesnt-capitalism-need-government-for-balance" name="doesnt-capitalism-need-government-for-balance">Doesn’t capitalism need something like a government to counteract and balance it?</a></h3>

<p>You mean counteract and balance the peaceful and voluntary interaction between people? No, that’s not necessary.</p>

<h3><a href="#no-help-for-the-poor" name="no-help-for-the-poor">Does this mean you don’t want poor people to receive any help?</a></h3>

<p>No. People are free to help each other in a libertarian society.</p>

<p>Moreover, governments only hinder the growth of wealth. Global poverty is at an all-time low (or was, before the shutdowns) because people are evermore free to create, trade, and solve problems. No top-down legislation has, or could possibly, create wealth for people who need it.</p>

<h3><a href="#government-as-foundation" name="government-as-foundation">Don’t you need some foundation like the government on which to build and make decisions?</a></h3>

<p>No more than biological evolution needs some blueprint before bringing complex, seemingly-designed structures into reality.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a single person or company to know the problem-situation of millions or billions of other people. An economy is unplanned—objective prices emerge from the local interactions of countless individuals in various problem-situations. No one can determine what a price of some good ‘should be’, and when they try, shortages and inefficiencies result. Similarly, the very processes by which goods and services are created from raw materials is often global in complexity, counterintuitive, and such that no single person knows the entire process (See <a href="https://fee.org/resources/i-pencil/"><em>I, Pencil</em></a> by Leonard Read).</p>

<h3><a href="#protection-from-exploitation" name="protection-from-exploitation">How would you protect employees from exploitation?</a></h3>

<p>Certainly not by initiating exploitation in the first place, which is what governments do when they acquire revenue coercively.</p>

<p>Employees are free to unionize if they think that that might benefit them.</p>

<p>The more employers there are competing for labor, the greater the conditions (wage, working conditions, etc.) will be for employees. This is a special case of a more general principle: competition breeds higher quality. Governments cannot provide a multitude of employers in the market.</p>

<p>Technological innovation increases the productive capacity of a given employee, which increases his bargaining power. Innovation cannot be coerced into existence. Rather, it must be created.</p>

<h3><a href="#protection-from-fraud" name="protection-from-fraud">How would you protect consumers from fraud?</a></h3>

<p>You could file a claim with a private arbitrator (which already exist). There could be private reviewers of companies and products (which already exist). There’s a market opportunity for competition to discourage fraud. And so on. Conversely, the government is the reason we have corporations that get the government to enforce regulations to make it harder for others to enter their market and compete. A libertarian society would be better equipped to deal with fraud, and there would exist no institutionalized discrimination against business.</p>

<h3><a href="#why-is-freedom-important-to-you" name="why-is-freedom-important-to-you">Why is freedom so important to you? Isn't loving and helping other people just as important?</a></h3>

<p>Freedom and helping others are not mutually exclusive. And again, people are free to help each other in libertarian societies. Helping others when you want to and can: great. Being <em>forced</em> to help others whether you want to or not: evil.</p>

<h3><a href="#but-what-about-traffic-rules" name="but-what-about-traffic-rules">But rules are enforced in traffic, so it's okay to coerce people.</a></h3>

<p>It’s truly amazing how many people reach for the traffic thing as a “gotcha,” and how reliably they do. There must be some widespread meme causing this curious phenonemon… In any case, that coercion is okay because traffic rules need to be enforced is a complete non sequitur.</p>

<p>Yes, traffic needs rules. Whoever owns the roads can make those rules and enforce compliance in exchange for letting others use them. This goes back to property rights: he who <em>owns</em> the roads gets to make the rules. The government (sadly) owns the roads, so the government gets to make traffic rules. But government does not own people’s homes, or their bodies, or any other of their property (by definition, or else it wouldn’t be <em>their property</em>), and yet government makes and enforces rules about what people can and cannot do with their property, and robs them of some of it. That’s a gross and immoral overreach. This immorality is the fundamental gap the traffic metaphor doesn’t bridge, and that no argument has ever bridged. Traffic rules have nothing to do with coercion.</p>

<h3><a href="#what-about-externalities" name="what-about-externalities">What about externalities?</a></h3>

<p>1) Even if externalities pose a problem, it is a non sequitur to conclude that only an institution that acquires resources coercively may solve it.</p>

<p>2) Furthermore, because the value derived by one’s environment is subjective (individuated and continuously changing in time), the benefit or cost of externalities as consumed by each individual is impossible to keep track of.</p>

<p>3) Thirdly, if the only way that a given externality is dealt with is via coercion, then, by demonstrated preference, this implies that people would rather …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

			<p><span>T</span>he 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics went to three researchers who confirmed that Einstein’s general relativity predicts black holes, and established that the center of our own galaxy houses a supermassive black hole with the equivalent of 4 million suns packed into a relatively small space. Besides expanding our understanding of black holes, the strong gravitational field around the supermassive black hole is a lab to study nature under extreme conditions. Researchers, including one of the new Nobel Laureates, <a href="http://alliance.nautil.us/article/199/opening-a-new-window-into-the-universe" target="_blank">Andrea Ghez</a> at UCLA, have measured how the intense gravity changes the fine structure constant, one of the constants of nature that defines the physical universe, and in this case, life within it. This research extends other ongoing efforts to understand the constants and whether they vary in space and time.&nbsp;The hope is to find clues to resolve issues in the Standard Model of elementary particles and in current cosmology.</p><figure data-alt="Perkowitz_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17968_916cbd6f20415c2214d441deaefedf75.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>NOBEL LAUREATE:</strong> Andrea Ghez won science’s biggest prize for her co-discovery of a supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy. She has also precisely defined the elliptical paths of stars orbiting the galactic center.</span><span>Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Besides Ghez, the other Nobel Laureates honored in 2020 are Roger Penrose at Cambridge University, who deepened our theoretical understanding of black holes; and Reinhard Genzel, of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany. Ghez and Genzel carried out parallel but separate observations and analysis that led each to deduce the presence of our galactic supermassive black hole. At 27,000 light-years away, obtaining good data required huge telescopes. Ghez worked with the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and Genzel used the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Each researcher found that the motion of the stars they observed arose from an enormous mass at the center of the galaxy. They obtained the same value, 4 million times the mass of our sun, in a region only as big as our solar system—definitive evidence of a supermassive black hole.</p><p>Ghez’s research at Keck made her a co-author <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11567" target="_blank">in a paper</a> published this year, in which Aurélien Hees of the Paris Observatory and 13 international colleagues presented results for the fine structure constant near our galactic supermassive black hole. Remarkably, Ghez’s Nobel Prize-winning results supporting this research combined today’s theories and astronomical techniques with ideas dating back to Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton to examine the motion of stars near the supermassive black hole. This is another example of Newton’s insight about how science advances when he wrote in 1675, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”</p><blockquote><p>The constant in the strong gravity near the black hole could be a clue to modifying the Standard Model.</p> </blockquote><p>German astronomer Kepler is one such giant who changed science when he presented his laws of planetary motion in 1609. He was the first to show that the planets do not orbit the sun in divinely inspired perfect circles, as had been assumed. The orbits are ellipses with the sun at a focus of the ellipse, one of the two points symmetrically offset from the center that define how to construct an ellipse. Kepler also found a mathematical relation between the size of a planetary orbit and how long it takes the planet to complete a circuit.<br></p><p>In 1687 Newton gave Kepler’s laws a deeper, more coherent physical basis. Newton’s law of gravitation, based on mutual attraction between bodies, showed that a celestial object in a closed orbit around a mass follows an elliptical path that depends on that mass. This result, which today is taught in introductory astronomy, is the heart of how Ghez found the mass of the supermassive black hole. Her years of careful observations precisely defined the elliptical paths of stars orbiting the galactic center; then she used Newton’s theory to calculate the mass at the center (general relativity, which replaces Newton’s law, predicts black holes but Newton’s approach is sufficiently accurate for the stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole). Knowledge of these orbits would be crucial for measuring the fine structure constant in the strong gravity near the supermassive black hole. How that constant depends on gravity could be a clue to modifying the Standard Model or general relativity to deal with dark matter and dark energy, the two great puzzles of contemporary physics.</p> <p><span>T</span>his particular examination fits into a bigger, long-term examination of the fundamental constants of nature, each of which tells us something about the scope or scale of our deepest theories. Along with other constants, the fine structure constant (denoted by the Greek letter α), appears in the Standard Model, the quantum field theory of elementary particles. The numerical value of α defines how strongly photons and electrically charged particles interact through the electromagnetic force, which controls the universe along with gravity and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Among its effects, electromagnetism determines the degree of repulsion between protons and how electrons behave in an atom. If the value of α were much different from the one we know, that would affect whether nuclear fusion within stars produces the element carbon or whether atoms can form stable complex molecules. Both are necessary for life, another reason α is significant.</p><p>Other constants represent other major physical theories: <i>c</i>, the speed of light in vacuum, is crucial in relativity; <i>h</i>, the constant derived by Max Planck (now taken as “h-bar,” or <i>ħ</i> = <i>h</i>/2<i>π</i>), sets the tiny size of quantum effects; and <i>G</i>, the gravitational constant in Newton’s theory and general relativity, determines how astronomical bodies interact. In 1899 Planck used just these three to define a universal measurement system based on natural properties and not on any human artifacts. This system, he wrote, would be the same “for all times and all civilizations, extraterrestrial and non-human ones.”</p><blockquote><p>It raises the notion that out of many multiverses, the one where we exist is the one with the winning value.</p> </blockquote><p>Planck derived natural units of length, time, and mass from <i>c</i>, <i>ħ</i>, and <i>G</i>: <i>L<sub>P</sub></i> = 1.6 x 10<sup>-35</sup> meters, <i>T<sub>P</sub></i> = 5.4 x 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds, and <i>M<sub>P</sub></i> = 2.2 x 10<sup>-8</sup> kilograms. Too small to be practical, they have conceptual weight. In today’s universe the gravitational interaction between elementary particles is too weak to affect their quantum behavior. But place the bodies a tiny Planck length <i>L<sub>P</sub></i> apart, less than the diameter of an elementary particle, and their gravitational interaction becomes strong enough to rival quantum effects. This defines the “Planck era” 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, when gravitational and quantum effects were of similar strength and would require a combined theory of quantum gravity instead of the two separate theories we have today.<br></p><p>Nevertheless, to some physicists, <i>c</i>, <i>ħ</i>, and <i>G</i> are not truly fundamental because they depend on units of measurement. Consider for instance that <i>c</i> is 299,792 km/sec in metric units but 186,282 miles/sec in English units, This shows that physical units are cultural constructs rather than inherent in nature (in 1999, NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter fatally crashed because two scientific teams forgot to check which measurement system the other had used). Constants that are pure numbers, however, would translate perfectly between cultures and even between us and aliens with unimaginably different units of measurement.</p><p>The fine structure constant α stands out as carrying this favored purity. In 1916 it appeared in calculations for the wavelengths of light emitted or absorbed as the single electron in hydrogen atoms jumps between quantum levels. Niels Bohr’s early quantum theory predicted the main wavelengths but spectra showed additional features. To explain these, the German theorist Arnold Sommerfeld added relativity to the quantum theory of the hydrogen atom. His calculations depended on a quantity he called the fine structure constant. It includes <i>ħ</i>, <i>c</i>, and the charge on the electron <i>e</i>, another constant of nature; and the permittivity <i>ε</i><sub>0</sub>&nbsp; that represents the electrical properties of vacuum. Remarkably, the physical units in this odd collection cancel out, leaving only the pure number 0.0072973525693.</p> <figure data-alt="Perkowitz_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17967_a52357f1ce8160dee6563b6a3391ffa8.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>GIANT SHOULDERS:</strong> This year’s Nobel winners drew on astronomical techniques dating back to Isaac Newton, who wrote of scientific advances, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”</span><span>Nicku / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sommerfeld used α just as a parameter, but it gained fame in the late 1920s when it reappeared in advanced work on relativistic quantum mechanics by the French physicist Paul Dirac, and then in what the English astronomer Arthur Eddington hoped would be a Theory of Everything. He planned to merge quantum theory and relativity to derive the properties of the universe such as the number of elementary particles in it, and its constants, α among them.</p><p>One twist in Eddington’s approach was that he considered the quantity 1/α rather than α, because his analysis showed that it must be an integer as well as a pure number. This was consistent with a contemporary measurement that yielded 1/α = 137.1, tantalizingly near 137 exactly. Eddington’s calculations gave instead 136, close enough to raise interest. Further measurements however confirmed that 1/α = 137.036. Eddington’s attempts to justify his different result were unconvincing and for this and other reasons his theory has not survived.</p><p>But α and “137” remain linked, which is why Richard Feynman called 137 a “magic number.” What he meant has nothing to do with numerology. Rather it is that we know how to measure the value of α but not how to derive it from any theories we know. This is true also for the other fundamental constants, including pure numbers such as the ratio of the proton and electron masses, and is a lack in the Standard Model. Nevertheless, the value of α is critical in …</p></div></div>

Asked, at the close of a <a href="https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-tesla-death-bleeding-cash-a7928b06-3aae-43d7-bdde-5b9c41ef298f.html" target="_blank">conversation</a> with Axios, whether he believed in God, the CEO of both <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/so-can-we-terraform-mars-or-not" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> and Tesla paused, looked away from his interlocutors for a brief second, and then said, in that mild South African accent, “I believe there’s some explanation for this universe, which you might call God.”</p><p>Einstein did call it God. The German-Jewish physicist is famous for many things—his special and general theories of relativity, his burst of gray-white hair—including his esoteric remark, often intoned in discussions of the strange, probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, that “God does not play dice.” A final or ultimate equation, describing the laws of nature and the origin of the cosmos, Einstein believed, could not involve chance intrinsically. Insofar as it did—it being the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics—it would be incomplete. (The consensus now among physicists is that he was wrong; God is indeterminate. “All the evidence points to him being an inveterate gambler,” Stephen Hawking once <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=mqr;c=mqr;c=mqrarchive;idno=act2080.0039.401;g=mqrg;rgn=main;view=text;xc=1" target="_blank">said</a>, “who throws the dice on every possible occasion.”)</p><p>But what was with Einstein’s God-language in the first place? The question may be considered anew, in light of an auction at Christie’s, in New York, of a 1954 letter Einstein wrote that a couple years ago unexpectedly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/einsteins-god-letter-sold-at-auction-for-2point9-million--heres-why.html" target="_blank">sold</a> for $2.9 million. For the occasion the Princeton Club hosted a panel discussion on the conflict, or lack thereof, between science and religion, which featured theoretical physicist Brian Greene, philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, cognitive psychologist <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/human-exceptionalism-stifles-progress" target="_blank">Tania Lombrozo</a>, and Rabbi Geoff Mitelman, founding director of Sinai and Synapses, an organization dedicated to fostering respectful dialogue about religion and science. The event was open to the public, and I was excited to attend. (Full disclosure: At the time I was a&nbsp;<a href="http://sinaiandsynapses.org/2017-to-2019-sinai-synapses-fellows/" target="_blank">Sinai and Synapses fellow</a>.) I believe Einstein can still offer some insight on how to think about religion and science.</p><blockquote><p>“I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”</p> </blockquote><p>What Einstein said, in a note to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, whose book <i>Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt</i> Einstein was reviewing, was nearly as scathing as any contemporary critique of religion you might hear from Richard Dawkins, <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/an-atheists-guide-to-spirituality" target="_blank">Sam Harris</a>, or <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-christopher-hitchens-was-a-hero-to-scientists" target="_blank">Christopher Hitchens</a>. “The word God is for me,” Einstein wrote, “nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still purely primitive, legends. No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can change this for me.”<br></p><p>It is no wonder why, for decades, Einstein’s views on religion became muddled in the popular imagination: The inconsistency is clear. Here, God means one thing; over there, another. Just going off his letter to Gutkind, Einstein appears to be an atheist. But read Einstein in other places and you find him directly declaring that he is not one. “I am not an Atheist,” he <a href="https://home.isi.org/john-gray-spinoza-today" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=c-ozDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53&amp;lpg=PT53&amp;dq=" q="I am not an atheist" target="_blank">said</a> in an interview published in 1930. “I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds.” Einstein was asked whether he was a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/the-case-for-cosmic-pantheism" target="_blank">pantheist</a>. The rest of his response is worth quoting in full:</p><p>May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvellously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza’s Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.</p><p>Benedict Spinoza, the 17th century Jewish-Dutch philosopher, was also in his day confused for an atheist for writing things like this, from his treatise <i>Ethics</i>: “All things, I say, are in God, and everything which takes place takes place by the laws alone of the infinite nature of God, and follows (as I shall presently show) from the necessity of His essence.”</p><p>In 1929, Einstein received a telegram inquiring about his belief in God from a New York rabbi named Herbert Goldstein, who had heard a Boston cardinal say that the physicist’s theory of relativity implies “the ghastly apparition of atheism.” Einstein settled Goldstein down. “I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world,” he told him, “not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”</p><p>What that amounted to for Einstein, according to a 2006 <a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=19107" target="_blank">paper</a>, was a “cosmic religious feeling” that required no “<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/the-worth-of-an-angry-god" target="_blank">anthropomorphic conception of God</a>.” He <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm" target="_blank">explained</a> this view in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>: “The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man’s image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. Looked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another.”</p><p>So, as Einstein would have it, there is no necessary conflict between science and religion—or between science and “religious feelings.”</p><p><i>Brian Gallagher is an associate editor at&nbsp;</i>Nautilus<i>.

                <p><em>This post is an update on the Pyjion project to plug the .NET 5 CLR JIT compiler into Python 3.9.</em></p>
<p>.NET 5 was released on November 10, 2020. It is the cross-platform and open-source replacement of the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core"><strong>.NET Core</strong></a> project and the <strong>.NET</strong> project that ran exclusively on Windows since the late 90’s.</p>
<p>.NET is formed of many components:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 builtin languages, C#, F# and VB.NET, each with its own compiler</li>
<li>A standard library</li>
<li>A common intermediate language to abstract the high level languages from the core runtime. This is a standard known as <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/ecma-335/tree/master/docs">ECMA 335 CIL</a>.</li>
<li>A common language runtime (CLR) that compiles CIL into native machine code so that it can be executed and packages executables into .exe formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=".NET architecture" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Common_Language_Infrastructure.png"></p>
<p>.NET 5 CLR comes bundled with a performant JIT compiler (codenamed RyuJIT) that will compile .NETs CIL into native machine instructions on Intel x86, x86-64, and ARM CPU architectures.</p>
<p>You can write code in a number of languages, like C++, C#, F# and compile those into CIL and then into native machine code (as a binary executable) on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>But this is a blog about Python. So what does this have to do with Python?</p>
<p>Pyjion is a project to replace the core execution loop of CPython by transpiling CPython bytecode to ECMA CIL and then using the .NET 5 CLR to compile that into machine code. It then executes the machine-code compiled JIT frames at runtime instead of using the native execution loop of CPython.</p>
<h2>Very-quick overview of Python’s compiler</h2>
<p>When CPython compiles Python code, it compiles it into an intermediate format, similar to .NET, called Python bytecode. This bytecode is cached on disk so that when you import a module that hasn’t changed, it doesn’t compile it every time. You can see the bytecode by disassembling any Python function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(half)
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
              4 BINARY_TRUE_DIVIDE
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>To execute anything on a CPU, you have to provide the OS with machine-code instructions. This can be accomplished by compiling them up-front using a compiled like the C or C++ compilers. They compile code into executable formats as either shared libraries or standalone executables. <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/extending-python-with-assembly.html"><em>See my post on Python/assembly for a bit more info on this topic</em></a>.</p>
<p>CPython converts the bytecode into machine code instructions like looping over them in a precompiled function, called the evaluation loop. This is essentially a big for loop with a switch statement. The compiled version of CPython that you’re running already has the instructions required. This is why CPython’s evaluation loop is an “AOT”, or “Ahead of Time” compiled library:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 1" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Note: There is a lot more to CPython’s compiler. I’ve written a <a href="https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/">whole book on the CPython compiler and the internals of CPython</a> if you want to learn more.</strong></p>
<p>There are a few issues with this approach. The biggest is speed. A series of inline machine-code instructions is very performant. CPython has to make judgements at runtime for which code branch to follow every time your function is run. This leads to CPython being 100x slower in “tight-loop” problems where its executing the same thing again and again. The machine-code is compiled ahead of time and it has to loop around to get to the right instructions. Checkout my PyCon talk for a more in-depth explanation:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4nkgJdVZFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The most common way around this performance barrier is to compile Python extensions from C. This produces a custom binary with inline machine-code instructions for the task at hand. This is how most machine-learning and data science libraries like numpy, pandas, SKL are put together. This approach is still AOT compiling the code. It also requires a lot of knowledge of C. This approach has worked really well for the data science community, where algorithms can be performant and leverage low-level platforms <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/index.html">like GPUs or specialised AI chipsets</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few issues with the AOT extension module approach. One is that it still uses the evaluation loop. C extension modules are a set of functions. Once you call the C-compiled function, its in the performant code, but your Python code that’s calling it still lives inside Python’s loop. If you want to leverage a compiled library and your Python code is doing some heavy number crunching, you end up having to use an API of functions, like numpy, instead of a more fluent Python API:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.ones([9, 5, 7, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = np.ones([9, 5, 4, 3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.dot(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 9, 5, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.matmul(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 3)
</code></pre>

<h2>What Pyjion does to solve this issue</h2>
<p>A few releases of Python ago (CPython specifically, the most commonly used version of Python) in 3.7 a new API was added to be able to swap out “frame execution” with a replacement implementation. This is otherwise known as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0523/">PEP 523</a>. PEP 523 also added the capability to store additional attributes in <em>code objects</em> (compiled Python code.</p>
<p>Pyjion does not compile Python code. It compiles Python frames (code objects, like blocks, functions, methods, classes) into machine-code at runtime using a performant JIT:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 2" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide2.png"></p>
<p>CPython compiles the Python code, so whatever language features and behaviours there are in CPython 3.9, like the walrus operator, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584">the dictionary union operator</a>, will all work exactly the same with this extension enabled. This also means that this extension uses the same standard library as Python 3.9.</p>
<p>Pyjion is a “pip installable” package for standard CPython that JIT compiles all Python code at runtime using the .NET 5 JIT compiler. You can use off-the-shelf CPython 3.9 on macOS, Linux or Windows. After installing this package you just import the module and enable the JIT.</p>
<p>Once a frame has been compiled, the binary code is cached in memory and reused every time the function is called:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 3" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide3.png"></p>
<h2>Using Pyjion</h2>
<p>To get started, you need to have .NET 5 installed, with Python 3.9 and the Pyjion package (I also recommend using a virtual environment).</p>
<p>After importing pyjion, enable it by calling <code>pyjion.enable()</code> which sets a compilation threshold to 0 (the code only needs to be run once to be compiled by the JIT):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.enable()
</code></pre>

<p>Any Python code you define or import after enabling pyjion will be JIT compiled. You don’t need to execute functions in any special API, its completely transparent:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
&gt;&gt;&gt; half(2)
1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Pyjion will have compiled the <code>half</code> function into machine code on-the-fly and stored a cached version of that compiled function inside the function object.
You can see some basic stats by running <code>pyjion.info(f)</code>, where <code>f</code> is the function object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.info(half)
{'failed': False, 'compiled': True, 'run_count': 1}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the machine code for the compiled function by disassembling it in the Python REPL.
Pyjion has essentially compiled your small Python function into a small, standalone application.
Install <code>distorm3</code> first to disassemble x86-64 assembly and run <code>pyjion.dis.dis_native(f)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion.dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.dis.dis_native(half)
00000000: PUSH RBP
00000001: MOV RBP, RSP
00000004: PUSH R14
00000006: PUSH RBX
00000007: MOV RBX, RSI
0000000a: MOV R14, [RDI+0x40]
0000000e: CALL 0x1b34
00000013: CMP DWORD [RAX+0x30], 0x0
00000017: JZ 0x31
00000019: CMP QWORD [RAX+0x40], 0x0
0000001e: JZ 0x31
00000020: MOV RDI, RAX
00000023: MOV RSI, RBX
00000026: XOR EDX, EDX
00000028: POP RBX
00000029: POP R14
...
</code></pre>

<p>The complex logic of converting a portable instruction set into low-level machine instructions is done by .NET’s CLR JIT compiler.</p>
<p>All Python code executed after the JIT is enabled will be compiled into native machine code at runtime and cached on disk. For example, to enable the JIT on a simple <code>app.py</code> for a Flask web app:</p>
<pre><code>import pyjion
pyjion.enable()

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2>Will this be compatible with my existing Python code? What about C Extensions?</h2>
<p>The short answer is- if your existing Python code runs on CPython 3.9 – <strong>yes</strong> it will be compatible. To make sure, Pyjion has been tested against the full CPython “test suite” on all platforms. In fact, it was the first JIT ever to pass the test suite.</p>
<p>Thats because this isn’t a Python runtime, it uses the existing Python compiler to compile your code into Python bytecode (low level instructions).</p>
<p>Pyjion uses the same dynamic module loader as CPython, so if you import a Python extension from your virtual environment, it will work just the same in Pyjion.</p>
<h2>Project History</h2>
<p>Pyjion isn’t new. Brett Cannon and Dino Viehland started the Pyjion project 4 years ago. This was the first JIT to pass the full CPython test suite.
There were some limitations to the original proof-of-concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written against an old version of .NET Core</li>
<li>Required custom patches of .NET and compiling from source</li>
<li>Required custom patches of CPython and compiling from source</li>
<li>Only worked on Windows</li>
<li>It was written for Python 3.6 before PEP 523 was agreed and merged</li>
</ul>
<p>Has much changed since Python 3.6? To the average user, not really. But under the hood, the implementation of a few things has completely changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function calls</li>
<li>Iterators</li>
<li>Exception Handling</li>
<li>Dictionary, list and set comprehensions</li>
<li>Generators and coroutines</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, a <strong>lot</strong> has changed in the last few releases of CPython. The new fork to get Pyjion working with the latest version of everything was a big undertaking…</p>
<p><img alt="not-much-has-changed" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts-original/not-much-has-changed.png"></p>
<p>The goal with the latest patch was to get the project up to the condition of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the release binaries of .NET 5 and CPython 3.9</li>
<li>Making it work across all platforms</li>
<li>Implement the PEP523 interface</li>
<li>Implement all the new features of Python 3.9</li>
<li>Making the package “pip installable” from PyPi</li>
<li>Improving the test coverage</li>
<li>Adding a disassembler (both machine-code and CIL) to aid development</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is this faster?</h2>
<p>The short answer a little, but not by much (yet).</p>
<p>JIT compiling something …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Adversity is everywhere. It can strike when youâ€™re least expecting it, and it might be accompanied by unpleasant, albeit normal, reactions such as anxiety, excessive worry, disappointment, grief, shame, frustration and sadness. Moving on from, and even growing through, a difficult or traumatic experience can be hard, but it <em>is</em> possible.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve already heard, read or witnessed many inspiring stories of people who have bounced back from adversity, such as the death of a loved one, losing a job, serious physical illnesses, accidents, disasters or wars. But what should we do when weâ€™re faced with hardship ourselves? How will we deal with our pain? Can we prepare ourselves for this inevitable experience?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are not straightforward, but the psychological concept of â€˜resilienceâ€™ can help. Given that weâ€™re all currently in the midst of an adverse situation â€“ the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ understanding resilience is especially pertinent. Resilience is defined as the ability to navigate successfully through, and recover from, stressful circumstances or crisis situations, and to do so in a way that leads to healthy functioning over time. That is, resilience is not only about bouncing back, but also about experiencing some sort of growth, such as finding meaning and purpose, self-awareness or experiencing improvement in interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Defining resilience might sound easy, but itâ€™s a more complex concept than you might think. First, many people display resilience immediately following exposure to a hardship or potentially traumatic event. And in the long term, most people who have gone through traumatic experiences donâ€™t show signs of depression or anxiety problems later in life. Consider the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01682.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of New York residents in the wake of the terrorist attack of <span>11 September</span> 2001: the researchers found that <span>65 per cent</span> of those questioned had returned to their normal level of functioning within six months. You too might be capable of more resilience than you realise.</p>
<p>Second, although some people seem disposed to deal more effectively with stress and anxiety, and to better regulate their emotions, resilience is not a single trait that you either possess or you donâ€™t. Rather, itâ€™s a set of skills, including behaviours and thoughts that can be improved through learning and exposure to new experiences.</p>
<p>Third, although individual characteristics matter for resilience, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11202047/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">contextual</a> factors also have an influence, such as the social, health and economic resources available to you. For instance, you might be predisposed for resilience but, if you were brought up in an unsupportive and stressful environment by abusive parents, you might not develop it. In fact, as well as being inaccurate, it is unfair and harmful to see resilience purely as an individual trait â€“ people who struggle to recover from a negative life event might think that thereâ€™s something inherently wrong with them, which isnâ€™t true. Access to certain external resources is a major factor in anyoneâ€™s ability to display resilience.</p>
<p>Fourth, resilience is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22559117/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">dynamic</a>. You can be resilient in one context but then your capacity for resilience, or your ability to draw on available resources, might not be enough for another, possibly more demanding or difficult, situation. All of us can be more resilient at one stage in our lives but less so in another.</p>
<p>Fifth, being resilient doesnâ€™t mean that you wonâ€™t have a wound or a scar. For example, in one <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12416919/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 200 people who had experienced the death of their spouse, even those identified as the most resilient reported having at least some grief symptoms. Almost everyone suffers some negative effects, such as emotional strain, throughout the journey of adversity but resilient individuals manage to recover well.</p>
<p>Lastly, it might sound paradoxical, but resilience comes from being in touch with adversity, not from trying to stay positive all the time, or from always running away from difficulties in life. Many of us are taught from an early age that we should avoid difficulties or stress, and itâ€™s true that toxic chronic stress is a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27417486/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">risk</a> factor for mental health problems. But exposure to some level of stress provides you with the necessary challenge to become stronger in the face of hardship, as long as you learn to cope successfully. By contrast, if youâ€™re overly avoidant of challenges in life then, when an unavoidable hardship arises, you wonâ€™t have developed the necessary skills to cope.</p>
<p>Understanding the complex, dynamic nature of resilience is important because it shows that there is no magic pill or a recipe that will make you resilient. Each individual will have their own way of coping with distress, their own pace of recovery, and levels of learning from a crisis. It is also totally fine to fail to recover quickly or entirely from a particular adversity. Itâ€™s okay to get hurt or lost during a difficult time.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>Science doesnâ€™t have all the answers on how one becomes resilient, but what we do know is that it requires learning to tap into both inner and external resources. Iâ€™ll touch on some of the most fundamental ones.</p>
<p><strong>Connect with others</strong></p>
<p>During difficult times, it is common to want to withdraw from the world. This can be for varied reasons, such as feelings of shame, the fear of being judged, or not wishing to be a drain on others. Although there is nothing wrong with wanting solitude during difficult times, it is also important that you stay in touch with people, at least to an extent. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12555794/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Research</a> shows that the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder is higher for people who lack post-trauma social support (bear in mind that, even if you have friends and family, if you avoid seeing or talking to them entirely, then it will be impossible for them to help you).</p>
<p>People who choose to connect with others and nurture their relationships, as opposed to isolating themselves, tend to become better at coping with a hardship and growing through their experience. The emotional and instrumental social support you get from your intimate relationships, and from your communities, can also give you the motivation to handle stress in a healthy way.</p>
<p>So, when difficulties are overwhelming, try reaching out to others who can provide support. There are a few different ways you could do this. One is simply by talking about what youâ€™re going through. It can be frustrating to talk to someone who just pretends that theyâ€™re listening or who is judgmental, so try to find someone who is accepting and good at listening. You could also try letting them know in advance that all you need is to be listened to. Another approach is to ask specifically for instrumental help, such as information, advice or help with daily tasks. More resilient people are usually aware that they canâ€™t solve every problem on their own. You might find it especially difficult to ask for help if youâ€™re used to handling problems on your own, or if you see relying on others as a sign of weakness. Try to remember that it takes courage to ask for help, and being in need simply means that youâ€™re human.</p>
<p>Here are a few more ideas for how to connect with others and get support: if you exercise or go for a walk, try inviting someone else along. Make a commitment to call or email loved ones regularly. Make use of the power of play â€“ laugh with friends or get silly. If there are social groups that share a common interest or hobby of yours, join them to exchange ideas or to get to know new people. Support others informally or through volunteer organisations; helping others makes us feel happy and valued.</p>
<p>Most importantly, donâ€™t wait for a disaster to occur to connect; make sure you have supportive relationships that nurture your sense of self-worth and need for intimacy, which in turn can contribute to resilience. If youâ€™re physically distant from your loved ones, look for ways to socially connect on a regular basis. Even the presence and support of a small number of people you can rely on can make a huge difference when adversity strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Accept and focus on what you can control</strong></p>
<p>About seven years ago, I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, which is a type of nerve damage. For me, this chronic condition manifests itself as a constant sharp pain and burning sensation on my feet. My life was miserable for six months before the diagnosis, and the pain was unbearable. I could barely walk for five minutes at a time. Upon the diagnosis, I was prescribed medication that eased my pain. Although itâ€™s manageable now, the pain is always there, and Iâ€™ll probably be on medication for the rest of my life. For the first few months, I had difficulty accepting this. Back then, I <span>was 35</span> and had been physically very active before developing this illness. At least a hundred times I asked myself how it was possible. Rejecting and blaming myself, others or the world seemed to provide some relief but it didnâ€™t get me anywhere.</p>
<p>Then one day I decided to stop wrestling with my pain and to start acknowledging it. This didnâ€™t mean that I liked the situation â€“ I hated it â€“ but it provided me with the space to start being proactive and to find effective coping strategies. The more I accepted my situation and my pain, the less pain I felt. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139188/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> that involved experimentally inducing pain in <span>62 men and</span> women showed the effectiveness of acceptance â€“ those taught acceptance experienced less sensory pain compared with a control group who used simple distraction.</p>
<p>Note that acceptance is not about giving up or quitting. Itâ€™s about gently noticing whatâ€™s going on, and allowing unpleasant experiences to exist, without attempting to change or deny them. With acceptance, you can choose to do what really matters to you and follow your values more easily.

<p>There seems to be a strong, almost causal relationship between curiosity and creativity.</p>



<p>My hypothesis is that curious people constantly do three things that are essential for the creative process: exploring, observing and asking questions.</p>



<p><strong>Curious individuals are interested in nearly everything.</strong></p>



<p>They’re always learning about and exploring new subjects. As a result, they hold in their heads a wide-ranging reservoir of information and mental models. This allows them to cross-pollinate ideas, extrapolate concepts and make unexpected connections.</p>



<p><strong>Another thing they’re very good at is observing.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Curious people tend to go through life at a different pace than everyone else. They move relatively slowly. And whenever something catches their attention, they stop to contemplate it. Their ability to look extensively at and into things allows them to unveil patterns that most people are too busy to see.</p>



<p><strong>Finally, curious people like to ask tons of questions.</strong></p>



<p>As everything else, questions are subject to probabilities — the more questions you ask, the higher your chances of asking a good question. Good questions, in turn, help them find things that don’t work or don’t make sense. Thus, opening the doors for breakthroughs and innovation.</p>



<p>By giving yourself permission to cultivate curiosity, you’re also laying the foundation for a prolific, creative life.</p>

<section id="main_content">


<p>I’m working on a project where I want to have an offline encyclopedia. It’s for training deep learning networks so it needs to be in plain text English. 
No markup, no special characters. Human readable without any interpreters, renderers, or parsers. I’ve got plenty of disk space, so that’s not a concern. 
Once I parse out all the Wikipedia articles I can get my hands on, I will create an index. Or I might index them into SOLR or something like that. Not sure yet.
I’m also going to implement it as a resource for a massive <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507">SQUAD repo</a>. I have uploaded a copy of the final result to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ltcmdrdata/plain-text-wikipedia-202011">Kaggle Datasets</a>. I’ve stashed the script in a <a href="https://github.com/daveshap/PlainTextWikipedia">dedicated repo on GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The first thing I should have learned is that Wikipedia is written in a demented Frankenstein language called WikeMedia Text. It’s a hybrid of HTML/XML and Markdown. 
It has no consistency and is the worst example of spaghetti code I’ve ever seen. I’m sure there are better implementations today, but I can see how and why it ended up the way it did.
For instance, you need to be able to create robust references and links, so the URL syntax is way jacked. It relies on a lot of procedural generation at display time.
Personally, if it were done again today, I think something like Jekyll would be way better. Instead of rendering again and again every time someone visits a page, render it once after each edit.
But that’s just me. So instead we’re left with this horrible hybrid language that should die in a fire.</p>

<p>Fine, it is what it is. I’m an expert automator, dammit, and if a machine can automatically render this nonsense, then I sure as hell can <strong>unrender it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-1---brute-force-regex">Attempt 1 - Brute Force Regex</h2>

<p>“Brute Force Regex” (BFR) is not a real thing. It’s just something I’ve been doing for years now in my automation habits. Usually, as a naive approach, I’ll try and do some 
search-and-replace jiggery pokery to just remove unwanted junk. Sometimes this is textual formatting, like brackets around tables or other HTML tags. 
So I ended up with the following function. Caution, it’s not pretty. This was just an experiment, and I wanted to share it so you would see what doesn’t work.</p>

    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I came up with this scheme because, at first glance, WikiMedia Text looked like a mixture of some basic HTML and some Markdown. 
I figured I could handle it with some basic regex replacements. This worked… to an extent. There were a few problems with it though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Couldn’t handle nested square brackets or curly brackets, and it turns out there are a lot of those</li>
  <li>Quickly became intractable when I encountered escaped unicode literals like <code>\u2013</code>. They are frigging everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wrote two more functions to try and tackle the bracketed stuff. These are things like links, citations, and pictures. Since I want a text-only Wikipedia, 
I really just needed to strip it all away.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remove_double_curly</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span> 
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>


<span>def</span> <span>remove_double_brackets</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>double_brackets</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>'\[\[.*?\]\]'</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>

            <span>if</span> <span>'|'</span> <span>in</span> <span>db</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'|'</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
            <span>else</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>'['</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions worked-ish. You might notice the carat <code>^</code> in the curly function. This told it to match anything except another open curly bracket. This forced it to find the
innermost nested curly brackets. Again, this mostly worked, but it failed a few times and I gave up trying to figure out why. The square brackets are a bit different, as
they tend not to be nested but the inner syntax could be several different things. I opted for the simplest possible way and even so, it missed a few things. No idea why.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-15---literal-evals">Attempt 1.5 - Literal Evals</h2>

<p>I suppose I should rewind and give some context. Wikipedia dump files are effing huge. Even with 32GB of RAM on my desktop, I was rapidly running out of memory just 
loading one chunk at a time. So that meant I had to read each file line by line. Like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>,</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
        <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>literal_eval</span><span>(</span><span>f'"""</span><span>{</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>"""'</span><span>)</span>  <span># this works... sometimes
</span>        <span>if</span> <span>'&lt;page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># new article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>'&lt;/page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># end of article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>+=</span> <span>line</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works great for just reading the thing one at a time. One consistency in the Wikipedia dumps is that every page starts and ends with <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/page&gt;</code> respectively.
This served as a great demarcation. So I tried to handle the unicode literals as they were coming in with <a href="https://www.kite.com/python/docs/ast.literal_eval">ast.literal_eval</a>. 
Spoiler: It worked. A little bit. This function frequently bombs out for various reasons.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2---existing-parsers">Attempt 2 - Existing Parsers</h2>

<p>I finally gave up on manually parsing WikiMedia Text and found some extant parsers. First up is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikitextparser/">wikitextparser</a> which, as of this writing, is actively maintained.
Second up was the simple <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> which got some of the stuff the first missed. These premade parsers are great in that they 
don’t require me to use any of my own brain power! They are, however, far slower than my regex replace functions. It can’t be avoided, though.</p>

<p>So now my output looks more like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4413617"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The Samajtantrik Sramik Front is a national trade union federation in Bangladesh. It is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Samajtantrik Sramik Front"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>

  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>

  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Attribution of recent climate change"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s much cleaner and moving in the right direction but I still have to figure out the literal eval reliably and a few square brackets are making it through as well. 
These premade parsers are far slower but one advantage of cleaning up Wikipedia articles is that they end up far smaller without the markup. If you just want the accumulated 
knowledge in plain text format, it ends up being a fraction of the size.</p>

<p>It’s not the most elegant solution but for just over 100 lines of code, it will parse almost all of Wikipedia and save it to 40MB chunks of JSON.
Running this script looks like the following:</p>

    <p><time>November 27, 2020</time></p><div>
        <p>Although <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en&amp;time_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:time;groupby:os&amp;lu=load_os_region&amp;load_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:page-load;groupby:os">an increasing portion of the web is adopting HTTPS</a>, a core part of the web infrastrcture lags behind in the form of plaintext DNS. The authentication problem of DNS is resolved by DNSSEC, but the queries are still plaintext. There’s currently a number of competing solutions that offer both authenticity and privacy concerns, namely DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and <a href="https://dnscrypt.info/">DNSCrypt</a>. I’ll leave it to Cloudflare’s blog to explain DNS, DoT and DoH, and the work towards both: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/">DNS Encryption Explained</a>. Due to operating systems not yet supporting encrypted DNS resolvers, some work needs to be done by the user, and this post describes part of the work using <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a>.</p>
<p>CoreDNS is pluggable DNS and service discovery server written in Go and the blessed DNS resolver of Kubernetes. Configuring CoreDNS is handled via setting up a series of <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/">middlewares</a> in the Corefile, which is what its config file is called. The <a href="https://coredns.io/manual/toc/">CoreDNS Manual</a> page does a brilliant job describing what CoreDNS is, how it works, how to install it, the structure of the configuration file, and more. To build our secure resolver, let’s pick up one of the examples off that page and gradually build the enhanced version.</p>
<p>Start by creating a file named <code>Corefile</code> containing the following, which is lifted verbatim from CoreDNS website:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>8</span><span>.8.8.8</span> <span>9</span><span>.9.9.9</span>
    <span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This is very simple, but let’s break it apart. The <code>.</code> means listen on port 53, the default port for UDP DNS, and across all interfaces. The configuration instructs CoreDNS to forward all requests to either <code>8.8.8.8</code> (Google DNS) or <code>9.9.9.9</code> (Quad9), picking either of them at random, and logs everything to stdout. This is not secure yet. This setup will forward all DNS queries in plaintext UDP packets. Let’s start by forwarding everything to <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-tls">Google DNS over TLS</a> resolvers without fallback:</p>

</div>
</div><p>At this point the setup has redundancy against Google’s services only. What if Google DNS service is down? The possibiity of a service going down is not far fetched, and we must account for it. However, note how the <code>tls_servername</code> directive can only be defined once, so it is bound to whatever upstream IP address we’re using. We can get around this by breaking the upstream into more local resolvers. I’ll add Cloudflare DNS as backup:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Now we have established the pattern. To add more backups, add more server blocks where the upstream is defined and the respective <code>tls_servername</code> is configured, and add the localhost IP address to the main server of <code>.:53</code>. This can be further enhanced by adding caching, prefetching, and loading the <code>hosts</code> file. The final setup will look like this:</p>

</div><p>Note that <code>policy</code> directive added in the first server block. Using <code>random</code> is superfluous because it is the default policy. The other policies available are <code>sequential</code> and <code>round_robin</code>. Regardless of the configured policy, CoreDNS will still perform health-checks and use a healthy upstream, so your queries are still answered even if one Google and/or Cloudflare are down. Configure your operating system to use your loopback address as the DNS server, set up CoreDNS service to start at boot, and your DNS queries are secure going forward.</p>

<p>For the past few years we’ve been hearing about mmWave 5G and now, in 2020 it’s finally here! mmWave 5G promises amazing speeds of 10 Gigabits/second, very low latency of around 1 millisecond, and many other amazing features. It currently operates in the frequency range between 24 GHz and 40 GHz. </p>



<p>Verizon has deployed this technology in many major cities across the USA. Here is a map that shows Verizon’s mmWave or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/fastest-5g-network-world-just-got-bigger-and-better" target="_blank">Ultra Wideband 5G</a> deployments.  </p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="399" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1024x399.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1024x399.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-300x117.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-768x299.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1536x598.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G.png 2031w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>mmWave 5G or 5G Ultra Wideband deployments in USA</figcaption></figure>



<p>While mmWave 5G deployments have been limited to date, they will grow over time. Verizon will also be deploying Sub-6 GHz 5G networks this year. As the name suggests these networks will be deployed at frequencies below 6 GHz. </p>



<p>In 2020 we have also seen many new 5G phones – some of which <a href="https://amzn.to/3ffJ30C">support mmWave</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3923Cwy">others that don’t</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>The biggest differences between mmWave 5G and all other wireless systems</strong></h4>



<p>As the name suggests, mmWave 5G operates at mmWave frequencies starting at 24 GHz. Why do we need to move to mmWave frequencies? To support higher upload and download speeds we need more bandwidth. A single channel of mmWave 5G can be 400 MHz wide. That large amount of contiguous bandwidth is simply not available at lower frequencies as almost all the spectrum has already been allocated for other applications. </p>



<p>The picture below shows the bandwidth of 5G systems relative to other cellular technologies. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png" alt="" width="690" height="159" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-300x69.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-768x177.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px"><figcaption>Bandwidths of cellular technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The maximum bandwidth of 5G is 20 times larger than the maximum bandwidth of a 4G signal. That makes sense when you compare the theoretical maximum achievable speed of a 4G network at 300 Mbps with that of a 5G network at 10,000 Mbps.  </p>



<h4><strong><span>Let’s now take a look at some of the major RF related challenges with mmWave 5G relative to previous generations of wireless systems</span></strong></h4>



<h3><strong>Radio Signals in the Real World</strong></h3>



<p>To put things in context, we have never operated our cellular communication systems at mmWave frequencies. The highest we have operated at is around 2 GHz for 4G systems and 6 GHz for Wi-Fi systems.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png" alt="" width="669" height="376" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"><figcaption>Frequency ranges for different wireless technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The only wireless systems we have implemented at mmWave frequencies are point-to-point, line-of-sight links. We will, for the first time ever, have to deal with operating in challenging mmWave RF environments. </p>



<p>What does that mean?</p>



<p>mmWave signals don’t propagate very far. They are in fact obstructed by even the smallest of objects on account of their small wavelength. Trees, buildings, moisture – all affect mmWave signal propagation. As a result, cities and suburbs are very challenging environments from a mmWave perspective. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Things that affect mmWave 5G signals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So how do we propose to solve the problem? The plan is to deploy about five times as many 5G base stations as with 4G and to use a technology called beamforming. As the name suggests this focuses RF energy beams in specific directions – toward users in particular. </p>



<p>However there still remains the fact that we have a relatively poor understanding of how exactly RF behaves at these frequencies in city environments where things change fast. Buildings and other structures appear relatively quickly and sometimes unexpectedly. The behavior of RF signals will then change accordingly and often unpredictably.</p>



<p>Unlike with previous systems operating at 2 GHz, we have not had the benefit of four decades of research and development. We have barely had two years to develop an understanding of how mmWave will work.</p>



<h3><strong>Complex Phone Development</strong></h3>



<p>The average phone today has multiple wireless sub-systems operating in it. Everything from 2G to 4G with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC and sometimes even FM. In small cell phone dimensions this is potentially chaos from an RF standpoint with signals interfering with one another. Increased power consumption of mmWave components is another significant issue as it results in more heat dissipation and lower battery life.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png" alt="" width="332" height="373" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png 703w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards-267x300.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px"><figcaption>Different wireless technologies in a phone today</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Higher Build and Development Costs</strong></h3>



<p>mmWave phones have multiple RF antenna modules designed to improve signal reception – a complex task without a doubt. Each of these has its own amplification, power management and transceiver. This complexity adds to the cost of hardware and results in a factor of <a href="https://benchmarking.ihsmarkit.com/614670/the-first-5g-phone-in-the-united-states-is-a-compromise-of-cost-and-design-ihs-markit-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three times higher</a> relative to the average 4G smartphone.</p>



<p><a href=""></a>What about testing mmWave phones on the manufacturing floor? As mentioned earlier, most of our wireless communication systems have been operating below 2 GHz. Even when you consider Wi-Fi, we don’t get any higher than 6 GHz. There are a number of RF testing products such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3fg0luz">spectrum analyzers </a>and <a href="https://amzn.to/2UFEG5N">signal generators</a> that operate up to 6 GHz. They are not very expensive. 5G mmWave however requires test equipment that has to cover 40 GHz at least. Such equipment can cost as much as $100,000 or more. Not very affordable at all.</p>



<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p>In this post we have talked about some of the RF challenges that we need to overcome to make mmWave 5G a success. We provided an overview of about three broad areas: RF propagation, Phone hardware and Development costs. The challenges in each of these areas are very daunting but exciting at the same time.</p>

      <h2 id="flatbuffer-as-serialization-agnostic-idl">FlatBuffer as serialization agnostic IDL</h2>

<p>Many popular IDLs mix the following two separate concerns into one leading to less than optimal results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language agnostic type system supporting enums, types and variants/unions.</li>
  <li>RPC oriented wire format with backward compatibility as a first class concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixing these two concerns has many downsides. The first one is the weakening of the type system.
Suppose we have a union containing two things:</p>



<p>The generated code from the IDL compiler may add a third state - “not defined” or similar to deal with the
case that the RPC was sent from an old client. This concern now permeates code at other layers in the stack
where one doesn’t necessarily need to worry about this third state. This could happen for example if we fail
the request at the lower levels of the stack and deal with only two possibilities in the application logic.</p>

<p>Secondly, scalars and types may have different syntax in how optionality is expressed. My understanding is that
this is also driven by the serialization concern in the flatbuffer IDL.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-serialziation-then">What about serialziation then?</h2>

<p>Yes, someone has to do the work for serialization. A good way forward is to do it in a language specific library.
Rust has <code>serde</code> and Python has pure-protobuf.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@message
@dataclass
class Cat:
    name: str
    age: int
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="example-idl">Example IDL</h2>

<p>This work (<a href="http://github.com/adsharma/flattools">flattools</a>) separates these two concerns as described above. It adopts the flatbuffer IDL (since it doesn’t have the
field numbering concern in the IDL, significantly simplyfying the language). Attributes have been used to support 
high level type safe concepts such as Protocols and Views (a concept similar to graphql fragments).</p>

<p>Here is a flatbuffer derived IDL file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>enum Color : byte { Red = 1, Green, Blue }

table NamedAnimal (protocol) {
    name : string (required);
    age : short;
}

table Colorophile (view) {
    favorite_color: Color;
}

table Animal {
    name : string (required);
    length: ulong;
}

// Some languages prefer protocols like NamedAnimal
// as a subclass syntactically. When all supported
// languages do so, it's ok to add the protocol here
table Person (Animal, Colorophile) {
    address : string;
    age : short = 18;
}

table Product {
    label: string;
    price: int;
}

union Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running it through the generator results in the following Rust code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler, do not modify
#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Color {
    Red = 1,
    Green = 2,
    Blue = 3,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct NamedAnimal {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Animal {
    pub name: String,
    pub length: Option&lt;u64&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Person {
    pub address: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
    pub favorite_color: Color,
}

impl Default for Person {
    fn default() -&gt; Person {
        Person {
           age: Some(18),
          ..Default::default()
        }
    }
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Product {
    pub label: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub price: Option&lt;i32&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar output exists for Kotlin, Swift and Python3 + dataclasses in the same directory.</p>

<h3 id="backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</h3>

<p>Using the <code>deprecated</code> attribute is recommended.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Expand the set of supported languages</li>
  <li>Add decorators for serialization</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article id="block-the-art-of-self-study"><p><span><span><code>Contents</code></span></span></p><p><span><span>Self-study, self-learning, self-directed learning â€” these terms refer to the act of attaining knowledge without a formal education or assistance of a teacher. A person who self studies is called an </span><span><span><span><strong>autodidact</strong></span></span></span><span> from the Greek word, </span><span><span><span><strong>autodidaktos</strong></span></span></span><span>; autos â€˜selfâ€™ + didaskein â€˜teachâ€™.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Before the start of the digital revolution back in the 1990s, self-learning is an uphill task. You would have to go to a physical library in the day to read reference books and visit your teacher at school during office hours to ask questions. The concept of â€˜just google itâ€™ has not existed yet.</span></span></p><p><span><span>It is even mind-boggling when I think about our ancestors who learned to patch wounds using herbs, calculated the time of the day using a stick, and discovered how to cook rice from grains. Were these knowledge being passed down? I donâ€™t think so. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Our ancestors observed and experimented. They essentially self-studied to discovery. As awe-striking as this may sound, our ancestors had it difficult and probably spent an entire lifetime experimenting. Fast-forward to the year 2020 â€” </span><span><span><span><strong>especially in 2020</strong></span></span></span><span> â€” the act of self-studying is ever more accessible and relevant.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How many times have we already heard of our friend Jane who studied programming on Udemy made it to Apple and Amazon, earning a 6-figure salary?</span></span></p><p><span><span>How many times have we already heard of our friend John who learned to edit videos on YouTube became a YouTube star himself, earning millions before the age of 25?</span></span></p><p><span><span>What took 4 years to learn and tens of thousands of dollars to burn can be achieved in just 7 months at a fraction of that cost, sometimes even for free. Those who seize these opportunities are riding the waves of success decades earlier than their traditional peers.</span></span></p><p><span><span>However, it is important to acknowledge that there are certain practices â€” like those that require a license to operate such as doctors and lawyers â€” while in essence can be self-learned, a formal education is a must to prove legitimacy.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Now, how do you self-study?</strong></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>While there are a myriad of answers to this, I will offer my own take which I hope will benefit you.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-21b76dc780d9464db7954543d0b47a54"><span id="21b76dc780d9464db7954543d0b47a54"></span><span><span>Find the right materials and stick to it</span></span></h2><p><span><span><span><span>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>Finding the right materials is not an easy task.

But we need to decide fast, so we can start learning.</span></span></p><p><span><span>To tackle this, we can create a personal filter to help us find the suitable materials to use.

<p>JWTs are becoming more and more ubiquitous. Customer identity and access management (CIAM) providers everywhere are pushing JWTs as the silver bullet for everything. JWTs are pretty cool, but let’s talk about some of the downsides of JWTs and other solutions you might consider.</p>

<p>One way to describe JWTs is that they are portable units of identity. That means they contain identity information as JSON and can be passed around to services and applications. Any service or application can verify a JWT itself. The service/application receiving a JWT doesn’t need to ask the identity provider that generated the JWT if it is valid. Once a JWT is verified, the service or application can use the data inside it to take action on behalf of the user.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates how the identity provider creates a JWT and how a service can use the JWT without calling back to the identity provider: (yes that is a Palm Pilot in the diagram)</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-1.png" alt="JWT example"></p>

<p>When you contrast this with an opaque token, you’ll see why so many developers are using JWTs. Opaque tokens are just a large string of characters that don’t contain any data. A token must be verified by asking the identity provider if it is still valid and returning the user data the service needs.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates how the identity provider is called to verify the opaque token and fetch the user data:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-2-1.png" alt="Opaque token example"></p>

<p>This method of verifying and exchanging tokens can be very “chatty” and it also requires a method of persisting and loading the tokens inside the identity provider. JWTs on the other hand don’t require any persistence or logic in the identity provider since they are portable.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things you should consider when deciding to use JWTs. Let’s look at a few of the main ones.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-expire-at-specific-intervals">JWTs expire at specific intervals</h2>

<p>When a JWT is created it is given a specific expiration instant. The life of a JWT is definitive and it is recommended that it is somewhat small (think minutes not hours). If you have experience with traditional sessions, JWTs are quite different. Traditional sessions are always a specific duration from the last interaction with the user. This means that if the user clicks a button, their session is extended. If you think about most applications you use, this is pretty common. You are logged out of the application after a specific amount of inactivity. JWTs on the other hand, are not extended on user interaction. Instead, they are programmatically replaced by creating a new JWT for the user.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, most applications use refresh tokens. Refresh tokens are opaque tokens that are used to generate new JWTs. Refresh tokens also need to expire at some point, but they can be more flexible in this mechanism because they are persisted in the identity provider. This also makes them similar to the opaque tokens described above.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-are-signed">JWTs are signed</h2>

<p>Since JWTs are cryptographically signed, they require a cryptographic algorithm to verify. Cryptographic algorithms are purposefully designed to be slow. The slower the algorithm, the higher the complexity, and the less likely that the algorithm can be cracked using brute-force.</p>

<p>On a quad-core MacBook Pro, about 200 JWTs can be created and signed per second using RSA public-private key signing. This number drops dramatically on virtualized hardware like Amazon EC2s. HMAC signing is much faster but lacks the same flexibility and security characteristics. Specifically, if the identity provider uses HMAC to sign a JWT, then all services that want to verify the JWT must have the HMAC secret. This means that all the services can now create and sign JWTs as well. This makes the JWTs less portable (specifically to public services) and less secure.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the performance characteristics of JWTs and the cryptographic algorithms used, we ran some tests on a quad-core MacBook. Here are some of the metrics and timings we recorded for JWTs:</p>

<h2 id="jwts-arent-easily-revocable">JWTs aren’t easily revocable</h2>

<p>This means that a JWT could be valid even though the user’s account has been suspended or deleted. There are a couple of ways around this including the “refresh token revoke event” combined with a webhook. This solution is available in FusionAuth. You can check out the blog post I wrote on this topic here: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/tokens/revoking-jwts" title="Learn about Revoking JWTs">Revoking JWTS</a> and also watch the IBM webinar where I presented our solution here (when FusionAuth was still called Passport): <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tv/learn-how-to-revoke-json-web-tokens/" title="Jump to IBM Developer site">Learn how to revoke JSON Web Tokens</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-have-exploits">JWTs have exploits</h2>

<p>This is more a matter of bad coding than flaws that are inherent to JWTs. The “none” algorithm and the “HMAC” hack are both well know exploits of JWTs. I won’t go into details about these exploits here, but if you search around a bit you can find many discussions of them.</p>

<p>Both of these exploits have simple fixes. Specifically, you should never allow JWTs that were created using the “none” algorithm. Also, you should not blindly load signing keys using the “kid” header in the JWT. Instead, you should validate that the key is indeed the correct key for the algorithm specified in the header.</p>

<h2 id="sessions-as-an-alternative">Sessions as an Alternative</h2>

<p>Instead of using JWTs or opaque tokens, you always have the option of using sessions. Sessions have been around for over two decades and are proven technology. Sessions generally work through the use of cookies and state that is stored on the server. The cookie contains a string of characters that is the session id. The server contains a large Hash that keys off the session id and stores arbitrary data.</p>

<p>When a user logs in, the user object is stored in the session and the server sends back a session cookie that contains the session id. Each subsequent request to the server includes the session cookie. The server uses the session cookie to load the user object out of the session Hash. The user object is then used to identify the user making the request. Here are two diagrams that illustrate this concept:</p>

<h3 id="login">Login</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-3-1.png" alt="login example for sessions"></p>

<h3 id="second-request">Second request</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-4-2.png" alt="API call with session example"></p>

<p>If you have a smaller application that uses a single backend, sessions work well. Once you start scaling or using microservices, sessions can be more challenging. Larger architectures require load-balancing and session pinning, where each client is pinned to the specific server where their session is stored. Session replication or a distributed cache might be needed to ensure fault tolerance or allow for zero-downtime upgrades. Even with this added complexity, sessions might still be a good option.</p>

<p>I hope this brief overview of JWTs and Sessions has been helpful in shedding some light on these technologies that are used to identity and manage users. Either of these solutions will work in nearly any application. The choice generally comes down to your needs and the languages and frameworks you are using.</p>
