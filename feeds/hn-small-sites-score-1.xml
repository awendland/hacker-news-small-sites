<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We started IPRally with Clojure because of my personal love story with the language. Before IPRally, I was working as a developer in Adtile, working with a globally distributed analytics pipeline. We had the code organized in Clojure microservices, and the crazy thing was that the code was easy to understand. Not only that, it was easy to modify. We had tests for the microservice functionalities, but not for the finer details. Then without changing the tests, you could fearlessly modify the solution, refactoring the code into something comprehensible. Because the language is so powerful, such high level tests can be enough.</p><figure id="w-node-_396c9ff0-a22c-cab0-f5e4-4c7f1ef2a6fd-bb2520dd"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/601403e1e7a5aaf2ddd5fc95_Screenshot%202021-01-29%20at%2014.46.39.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Data is kept in simple format. When you can understand the data, the code makes more sense too.</figcaption></figure><h2>What is this language</h2><p>Clojure is a modern reincarnation of Lisp, an ancient language already specified in 1958. In fact, the original Lisp is the second oldest high level programming language after Fortran. It was favored especially among the artificial intelligence researchers. Clojure, the Lisp of today, is often used with web development, with integrations to both Java and JavaScript ecosystems. Lately there has been some movement towards the AI&nbsp;roots too with support for <a href="https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj">Python interop</a> and Clojure data science libraries like <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>.</p><p>You don’t usually learn Clojure as your first language, nor do you accidentally end up writing Clojure in the industry. That’s why studying it tends to be a conscious choice, and that’s why the Clojurians tend to come with some seniority, and <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#top-paying-technologies">are among the highest paid programmers</a>.<br></p><figure id="w-node-fa6d359a-091a-5690-3e52-7478f9de0661-bb2520dd"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/6013f8643c677af37b7e6ef6_fOxEYxyc3buKsGDE3RxXH5Ew787Gww5NzAGTWAci93BWp_1mr-ihMap5A51V0NcBHna0ENFgimFVDNj_ctH5Y4__GaGr964SfZhgZ9E99HDopawD3Xwa1IIxRg-4OAerpqIfK0Pd.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We use !&nbsp;in the end of function name if running it may have side effects. In this case, you are the machine.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Simple &gt; easy or safe</strong>‍</h2><div><p>At the end of the day, programming is mostly about building. There certainly are difficult challenges, e.g. natural language understanding, but mostly we developers focus on building systems in a maintainable way. And it’s not just about technical debt. Systems can be built in endlessly different ways, which of most eventually slow you down and cause suffering. When you compromise your solution slightly with every decision, you cannot fix it with just some refactoring. Building in a maintainable way is crucial for a product company - it eventually leads to a faster development speed and allows scaling up the organization.</p><p>Clojure opts for simplicity. As a comparison, Ruby is a language that tries to make things easy. But the Clojure way is to care less about how fast you can code, and more about minimising magic. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">Rich Hickey's classic presentation</a> on the subject comes recommended. Other languages like Java or Haskell choose safety, with type systems for data. With Clojure, the responsibility for creating safety nets is left for the developer. Advantage? In good hands, this can avoid complexity. <a href="https://labs.ig.com/lines-of-code-matter">Here</a> is an example how 441 lines of idiomatic Java become 58 lines of Clojure.</p></div><h2><strong>The right thing to do, even if it’s hard</strong></h2><p><strong>‍</strong>Aiming for simplicity makes one respect craftsmanship. No technology guarantees a simple solution. There are always more ways to create a mess than to find something elegant. Simple is hard, and we still choose simple. In the long run, a simple solution is more maintainable and safer than something more complex.&nbsp;</p><div><p>You surely can create a good solution with any moderately sensible technology. In the end of the day, developers matter more than technology or the processes, and the main advantage of Clojure comes from this. The developers who love programming and go the extra mile for learning a rare language are often pretty good ones. We met with two of the earliest IPRally team members, Juho Sepänmaa and Sebastian Björkqvist, in the Helsinki Clojure meetups. Even though Sebastian ended up working with deep learning and Python, Clojure helped once again to spot a top talent.</p></div><figure id="w-node-_2e926122-ad3f-0bf6-b715-65faa7fc86aa-bb2520dd"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bec13eafb29cc0f35b87530/6013f86447b2bdec5422e7cd_Qz284vk1xnW6rGT320sWN40Pe80uRZw1l6u31MOAVi9jfAt3iJkoW017WmSEk9BRZ4_L0VuhSRWlN3CMCMDbTa5l1AngS-dVGJK4W-QGOTW4m6es7kbOTohGsQ8WPZYQ4-EDT3PD.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The syntax for figuring out the good startups has never been simpler.</figcaption></figure><p>We are building a tech organization with foundations in Clojure philosophy.

Also, the demo mode will not require any additional configuration. If you are running securiCAD Vanguard with your own data, the AWS data will be fetched from your account via read access to standard AWS APIs and a model of your environment is automatically built and visualized.

<div><p><strong>Fetch AWS data<br></strong>Feeding AWS data into securiCAD Vanguard can be done in two ways.<br>– You can enter API keys of a read-only IAM user so that Vanguard can fetch it for you. If you want more information, see <em>Creating an IAM user</em>, <em>Setting IAM User permissions</em> and <em>Generating AWS Access Key</em> below.<br>– You can download a script, enter your keys, and let it fetch your configuration for you. It will then store the configuration as a json file which you then upload into vanguard. If you want more information see below.</p><p><strong>Amazon Inspector<br></strong>By including data from Amazon Inspector, securiCAD Vanguard can help you prioritize existing vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector data can be included in the simulation by either checking the box for Amazon Inspector when simulating from an IAM User or by running the CLI Script locally. securiCAD Vanguard will automatically fetch scans from the last 30 days and pick the lastest scan and gather CVE and Network Reachability data.</p><p><strong>Configure Simulations<br></strong></p><p>Once you have a model of your environment you may supply some additional information.<br>– Threat profile. Are you worried about criminals, nation state hackers or bored teenagers? Which threat profile you choose will affect the simulation results.<br>– High value assets. Which components in your environment contain the sensitive data or must not be compromised?<br>If you want to know more about these configuration options, please see <em>Assets &amp; Threat Profile</em> under <em>How it works</em> further down.</p><p><strong>Simulate<br></strong>Clicking ”Simulate” will start the attack simulation of the model generated from the AWS data and the selected scenario configuration.<br>Simulations are computationally heavy and may take anywhere from seconds to minutes depending on size of the generated model.<br>Once the simulation is done, the model and results can be inspected by selecting “Critical Path”, “Report” or “Model viewer”.

<div><p>In order to fetch the necessary data from AWS, an Amazon AWS IAM user with the right permissions and with access keys for API access is needed. Instructions on how to create an IAM user can be found <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br>Note: An IAM user is not needed when running the in-application Demo of securiCAD Vanguard as this will fetch data from a foreseeti-provided demo account.</p><p><strong>Setting IAM User permissions<br></strong>The IAM user used with securiCAD Vanguard needs to have permissions to read all necessary data from the AWS environment to be analyzed. This is done by attaching an IAM policy to the IAM account. See details <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. As a convenience, securiCAD Vanguard provides an IAM policy with the required permissions <a href="https://vanguard.securicad.com/iam_policy.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Generating AWS Access Key<br></strong>Regardless of how the AWS data provided to securiCAD Vanguard is obtained, either by the application fetching it directly from AWS via API or by downloading the data beforehand via a script, the IAM user used needs to have an API access key. If the access key was not created at the same time as the IAM account itself, the access keys can be created and obtained as described in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS documentation</a>.</p></div>

<div><p><strong>Critical paths viewer<br></strong>A Critical Path is the statistically shortest way in terms of effort from an attacker’s entry point to an asset identified as valuable.</p><p>As securiCAD Vanguard allows multiple assets to be set identified as valuable, there may consequently be several Critical Path to choose from in the Critical Path viewer.</p><p>“The Path” is the sequence of actions and and operations the attacker is expected to use in order to arrive at the desired outcome of the attack. A desired outcome can for example be to gain administrative access to a given EC2 instance which e.g. is represented by the HighPrivilegeAccess attack step and that will be highlighted in blue in the Critical Path viewer.</p><p>The term “path” may be a bit misleading as attack steps may require multiple preconditions to be satisfied. This is for example access via known credentials to a networked service which will require both the ability to connect to the service over the network as well as access to the login credentials. Such attack steps are referred to as “and” attack steps and they have a slightly thicker circle border compared to the “or” attack steps that only required a single precondition to be met.</p><p>In addition to the actual attack step graph of the critical path, the view will contain a number of controls including a legend explaining the different elements of the Critical Path and tools to help searching and viewing.</p></div>

Ryan is based in LA. I’m based in London. We work on the internet. </p><p>There has been a lot of “micro fund” chat on the internet: <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/24/how-rolling-funds-could-rock-vc/">The rise of rolling funds</a>, <a href="https://thecuriousinvestor.substack.com/p/rolling-funds-and-the-rise-of-the">the rise of Micro LPs</a>, <a href="https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists">The Rise of the Solo Capitalists</a>…</p><p>But little has been shared about how funds like ours operate, and how we aim to: </p><ul role="list"><li>Be the highest helpfulness to check-size ratio investor to our portfolio founders. One of our portfolio founders Harry Hurst tweeted about the concept <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhurst/status/1280165358255538179">here</a>. </li><li>Invest in the best early-stage deals partnering with founders early and driving returns </li><li>Be the best possible fund manager to our LPs: trusted, communicative and high-performing</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Jeff Lawson, the founder and CEO of Twilio, said this about strategy on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VHi9azzFenfH4R9SlBHqT?si=nsqv1LKhRa64c5vr1Lqs4Q">Bessemer Venture Partners Cloud Giants Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>I often say that strategy is a dirty word in business; it should be struck. Any time you find yourself talking about strategy, you’re probably off-course, actually. There’s only one business strategy: serve your customers.</blockquote><p>I agree with that. In venture, I think there’s only one core strategy: serving founders in a differentiated way. We’ve implemented workflows made up of tools, automations and habits to optimize our limited time to create leverage to serve founders.</p><p>Let’s break this down.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Spark</h3><p>Investors spend a lot of time in their inbox. 😅 </p><p>Here’s what makes Spark the best email tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Shared drafts:</strong> We use each other as a second pair of eyes to review email drafts including offers to invest in companies, deal-flow sharing with other investors and diligence follow-ups. Spark has a collaborative real-time editor that speeds up making edits before sending a draft. </li><li><strong>Spark templates:</strong> We use Spark templates to quickly share details about portfolio companies with other investors when helping founders with their fundraise.</li><li><strong>In-email private chat:</strong> We use this to make quick decisions about the email we receive. This includes cold email, deal-flow from other investors and admin/scheduling.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-_7ba6e6a7-3dcf-2fca-e88d-37c75a60536c-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600dfe86a1d3df2e88f92e31_spark-chat.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Airtable</h3><p>Airtable is the central storage for all information on deal flow, investments, and people in our network.</p><p>Here’s what makes Airtable the best tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Flexible:</strong> It’s flexible enough for us to store anything. We store a lot. </li><li><strong>Relational:</strong> You’ve probably heard that investors are in the relationship business. Relational databases like Airtable aren’t just about storing data, they store relationships between data. This helps us see links between the companies, deals, founders, investors, funds, and more in the WF universe. </li><li><strong>Integration friendly:</strong> It integrates with other tools to make all types of workflows that power the fund.</li></ul><p>Our Airtable “base” includes three primary tables:</p><p><strong>Companies</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We manage our Pipeline through an “Active Pipeline” view which filters companies we are meeting, diligencing or going to pass on. We also have a Missed view, a Tracking view, a Markups view and more to help us sort through companies. </li><li>We automatically capture pipeline entry and exit dates to track how fast we’re responding to founders. We try to get back to founders with a 7 day “SLA”. </li><li>We also record who introduced us to every deal sourced through an introduction. This links to our People table enriching our CRM. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>People</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>This includes founders, investors and others who have introduced us to companies. The table is designed to surface the context of our relationship: i.e for investors, it would surface which deals we’ve co-invested in, which deals they introduced us to, etc. </li><li>We have a “Warm Angel and Small Fund” view we use to share deals with angels + small funds we’re collaborating most with. </li><li>We also have a “Top Introducers” view that filters top introducers based on the # of deals + portfolio companies they’ve introduced us to.</li></ul><p><strong>VC Firms</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We use this table to capture who is investing at VC firms (linked of course to the People table), and what stages, categories, check sizes they invest in, and if they lead rounds. </li><li>Like our People table, we have a “Warm VC Firms” table we use to share deals with the firms that are most collaborative. It’s also helpful for identifying firms that might be best suited for a particular company based on their stage and market focus. </li><li>What makes this table especially useful for deal-sharing is the subjective context we capture in notes and often share with founders before making introductions. Here’s what a note would look like “Coatue is one of the most data-driven firms and Mazzeo’s one of the most energetic, product-minded investors I know.” Yes, that is a real example.</li></ul><p>🎁 Here’s a digital goodie: <a href="https://airtable.com/shr5i9tJSUl7ob7CY/tblbr0WwfLMZ1a9Mc/viwZ1sYZ9ripf5Ft4?blocks=hide">Template from our Airtable</a></p><figure id="w-node-_8d35af31-6898-a193-fc30-0a3d187f3df2-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600ee65b3b6b23278218888b_Screenshot%202021-01-25%20at%2015.40.25.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Zapier</h3><p>We automate as much as possible not just to save time, but also to not miss any steps in our processes. We want to be working on the right things, the right way. &nbsp;</p><p>Zaps we have running right now:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Deal channel creation zap: </strong>We have a Zap that automatically creates a deal channel in Slack for every deal we’re meeting from Airtable. More on that below. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a></li><li><strong>7-day SLA zap:</strong> We have a Zap that sets up a reminder to follow up 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline. This helps us ensure that we get back to every founder in a reasonable time. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a> (last 2 steps in template)</li><li><strong>Tracking zap:</strong> We have another Zap to follow up on companies we’re tracking. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/71703611e82231e90d81e13e60cd722dc5aad259">Template here</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Slack</h3><p>Slack works well for our working style at Weekend Fund. Here’s how we use it for deals:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Our deal creation Zap (as mentioned above) automatically creates a Slack channel for every company we’re meeting</li><li>We consolidate materials/context in the channel before every pitch call </li><li>We share questions for the founder in the channel before every pitch to ensure we’re well prepared </li><li>Debrief + decide next steps immediately after call </li><li>The 7 day SLA Zap goes off in the channel 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline </li><li>We close the channel only after we close the investment or send the pass email + “close the loop” email updating the person who introduced us to the deal</li></ol><p>In addition to deal channels, we have a few more to organize our communications:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>#deal-outbound:</strong> Vedika is using this channel to build a habit of outbound deal sourcing starting with 1x deal a day </li><li><strong>#experiments:</strong> As early stage becomes even more competitive, it feels even more important for us to run experiments. We’ve run experiments like Weekend Build, Fundraise From Home, and are working on our next one. This is the channel we use for experiments related chat. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>#shower-thoughts:</strong> This is a creative safe space where we discuss “What if we tried this?” ideas.</li></ul><p>At the time of this post, we have 25 Slack channels open. This might sound silly for a two-person team, but we’ve found this organization helpful in our communications. Our slack history is a searchable artifact for the years to come.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Vimcal</h3><p>The newest tool in our stack is Vimcal, the calendar app we use for scheduling. Here’s why we use it:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Timezone juggling: </strong>As a distributed team jumping on calls with founders around the world, we do a lot of scheduling across timezones. Vimcal is the best tool we’ve found for this.</li><li><strong>Efficient, but still personal:</strong> Gets us the efficiency of booking links without the risk of it coming off as transactional</li></ul><figure id="w-node-cfea6145-512c-34a8-e7b2-501f9f458622-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600e0104afcfe91478eedf7c_vimcal-gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>AngelList Venture Funds</h3><p>AngelList makes it possible for a small team (or single person) to run a venture fund. They provide:</p><ul role="list"><li>Operational support to execute deals - reviewing + signing legal docs and wiring funds</li><li>Tax reporting and accounting overhead </li><li>Capital calls and other LP management </li><li>A dashboard with investment and fund performance data (use <a href="https://angel.co/v/venture/calculator">this calculator</a> to see how your fund performs in comparison to others)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Share Your Stack</h3><p>This is our stack at a high level. There’s a lot more we do behind the scenes, and we’re always thinking about ways to improve our workflows, automations and habits. </p><p>While we don’t expect other fund managers to copy our way of working 100%, we’re hoping that sharing our stack and workflows will be useful for other emerging fund managers. </p><p>If you’re a fund manger, we’d love to see the stack powering your fund on Twitter. Tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/vedikaja_in">@vedikaja_in</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Thanks to Ryan Hoover, Varadh Jain and Liam Moore for reading drafts of this.</em></p></div></div>]]>

Besides being cost-effective, outsource programming brings your project extra flexibility and efficiency: you are paying your team for their time and work and don’t have employers’ obligations to them.<br>But where to outsource? In this article, we will provide you with a guide on outsourcing destinations with the best developers.</p>



<h2> What Makes A Country Good Outsourcing Destination?</h2>



<p>Here is what top outsourcing countries are known for:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Lower costs;</li><li>Highly-developed IT market;</li><li>Great educational infrastructure;</li><li>Good English level.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Those are general rules among the best countries for web developers. These are the basics and we recommend choosing from the countries that fit the above criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other questions to ask yourself are:</p>



<ol><li>Can you comfortably align your work with this country’s time zone?</li><li>Is it easy to find a competency you are looking for in this market?&nbsp;</li><li>Do this country’s mentality and cultural values correspond with yours?&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>And that’s pretty much it. Now, let’s see what are the outsourcing destinations that offer the best software developers in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1-355x199.jpg 355w, https://blog.onbench.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-4-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>

<p>Prices $18-40/hr</p>



<p>China has ranked unbelievable 100% in the <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/" rel="nofollow">HackerRank</a> list. It means that it seamlessly passed all of the HackerRank challenges and well, the quality is just perfect.</p>



<p>But before jumping to type “how to hire developers in China” in the search bar, we have to reveal two serious flaws of Chinese outsourcing market. First, is, of course, English – the general population of the country doesn’t speak it. Though, over the last few years, China has proudly received a label ‘moderate’ in the <a href="https://www.ef.com.co/epi/regions/asia/china/" rel="nofollow">EF English proficiency</a> rating. Second concern is the history of data leaks and copyrights violations.</p>



<p>Though if you are determined to hire China-based best developers (and they truly are the best!) we recommend you to thoroughly source for the right reliable partner and properly arrange all the paperwork. Safety first!</p>



<p>We tried to outline a country in each region and, honestly, these are the best countries for software engineers. And the list doesn’t end there as we listed only 5 of these amazing outsourcing destinations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if we were to take an overview and define which region in the world is better for outsourcing. Is it the Americas, Europe, Asia, or maybe Africa?</p>



<h3>Which Area Is The Best For Outsourcing?</h3>



<p>We briefly mentioned the downsides of each outsourcing destination. Argentina is a bit more pricey than other countries, China has copyright issues and the Philippines is behind its competitors due to a lower level of coding expertise. And to be honest, many of these issues exist due to countries’ specifics and politics as well as their locations.&nbsp;While Europe could be expensive due to high pay rates and employment rules and India can have too much of a variance in expertise, how to finally understand what is the best country to hire developers?</p>



<p>We’ll surprise you, but it’s all up to you to decide that. There isn’t a universal mechanism on how to find that perfect team, it really depends on one’s taste.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though our team is located in Ukraine and we truly believe that is the ultimate outsourcing location. Why?</p>



<ol><li>It has a lot of great talent. In 2018, Ukraine was <a href="https://2018.stateofeuropeantech.com/" rel="nofollow">reported</a> to have 200.000+ IT specialists.</li><li>Most of the developers speak English. Ukrainian IT companies offer free classes to their employees.</li><li>Easy-going and professional work ethics. Ukrainians share European values and are extremely easy to work with.&nbsp;</li><li>Reasonable pricing. Ukraine is a very affordable country with a low tax rate. So as a result, the software development prices end up being lower than other European countries.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>The ratings are often subjective. Though we tried to be neutral, yet share our thoughts and experience about the best countries to outsource programming too. We hope you enjoyed reading about the top outsourcing countries.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> is ubiquitous and I often run into it whilst developing or debugging.</p>
<p>When it’s in raw form like this …</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/plaintext.jpg" alt="json as raw text"></p>
<p>it’s hard for a human to interpret.</p>
<p>For small snippets, I could copy-and-paste it into a text file and hand-prettify it. For long snippets, that’s obviously not scalable.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon a very useful tool for interpreting and analysing (extremely) long JSON snippets. The surprising thing is that it’s been around for a long time and I just never noticed. However, once I knew about it, I kept using it, and it’s now my go-to tool for analysing long JSON snippets.</p>
<p>The tool?</p>
<p><strong>Mozilla Firefox.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the web browser. (It also helps that Firefox is my main browser.)</p>
<p>Here is a link to a random JSON file from the internet:</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bengtan/bengtan.github.io/main/content/css-named-colours-picker/dist/main.js.map">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bengtan/bengtan.github.io/main/content/css-named-colours-picker/dist/main.js.map</a></p>
<p>If you click on the link with Firefox you get something human-unfriendly:</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/plaintext.jpg" alt="json as raw text"></p>
<p>However, if you open a file with a <code>.json</code> extension on your local computer , you get …</p>
<p><img src="https://bengtan.com/blog/reading-long-json-snippets/json.png" alt="json in firefox json browser"></p>
<p>… which is a nice and useful and human-friendly json browser with collapsible sections, pretty printing and <strong>filtering</strong>.</p>
<p>(I think Firefox shows the json browser when the mimetype is set to json, and opening a local file with a <code>.json</code> extension is an easy way to set the mimetype.)</p>
<p>I stumbled upon this by chance. But since then, everytime I have a long JSON snippet to debug, I save it to a text file, give it a <code>.json</code> extension and open it with Firefox.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Okay, so installing Firefox just to browse JSON is probably overkill, but this is great for me since I already use it.</p>
<p>I’m glad Firefox is my main browser.</p>

<p>In 2015 I predicted the boom of <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> with my post <a href="https://kurozael.com/ethereum-org-future-of-the-web/">Ethereum.org - Future of the Web</a>, and I'm ready to do it again.</p><h2 id="what-is-nano">What is Nano?</h2><p><a href="https://nano.org/">Nano Currency</a> is <em>digital money for the modern world </em>and it offers a variety of revolutionary features that rival Bitcoin. It has <strong>no fees</strong> for transactions, and it is <strong>eco-friendly</strong> because it does not rely on mining. In addition, Nano transactions are near-instant and the technology is scalable.</p><h2 id="why-not-bitcoin">Why not Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over recent years Bitcoin has seen huge success, and this success has largely been driven by the following things:</p><ul><li>The fear of missing out as the price increases</li><li>Influencers artificially driving up the price</li><li>The potential profitability of mining</li></ul><p>Bitcoin is valuable, because it has value. People are willing to buy Bitcoin. However, we have seen that Bitcoin does not scale very well, and in addition to that, it incurs a huge cost in real-world resources to mine it. Massive GPU farms are mining Bitcoin and using up valuable energy that is better served elsewhere.</p><p>In a modern world, a world where people are conscious of their carbon footprint and the damage that we as human beings are doing to the world, we must be cautious of wasting energy.</p><h2 id="no-mining">No Mining?</h2><p>Because of Nano's very interesting <a href="https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#open-representative-voting-orv">Open Representative Voting</a> mechanism, Nano describes the way it provides value over other cryptocurrencies as such:</p><blockquote>Minimal block size allows for lightweight communication resulting in ultrafast transaction confirmation times</blockquote><blockquote>Without traditional Proof-of-Work and mining, nodes use significantly less energy per transaction than other popular networks</blockquote><blockquote>Emergent centralization forces for node operators are reduced due to the near zero marginal cost of producing consensus in Nano</blockquote><h2 id="why-not-ethereum">Why not Ethereum?</h2><p>I want to be clear here that by supporting Nano I do not detract from my previous views on Ethereum. I maintain that Ethereum is extremely important for the future of the web and this can be seen from the applications developed for it, and the surge in interest over the last 5 years.</p><p><strong>Ethereum is not a currency.</strong> Ethereum provides a very unique and important way to build decentralized applications for the web. We must not mistake Ethereum as your everyday fiat replacement.</p><p><strong>Nano is a Bitcoin alternative. </strong>The difference is that Nano is scalable, fast, fee-less, and contributes far less energy wastage than Bitcoin does. This makes it a great eco-friendly alternative and what has the potential to be the best currency of the future.</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://nano.org/">https://nano.org/</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.nano.org/whitepaper/english/">https://docs.nano.org/whitepaper/english/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/">https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/</a></li></ul><p>For a great read on Nano check out <a href="https://senatusspqr.medium.com/fight-the-climate-crisis-usenano-6e7c22d45b0e">Fight the Climate Crisis, #UseNano</a>, by <a href="https://reddit.com/u/SenatusSPQR">/u/SenatusSPQR</a>, their article delves deeper into to the true value of Nano in preventing the disastrous effects that Bitcoin could have on our planet.</p><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>This is not financial advice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="full_content">
    <p><em>Speculative</em>: the word is often used to describe the crypto market. Still, after what happened with <strong><b>Gamestop </b></strong><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-gme-gamestop/272716/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NYSE:GME)</a> rally, it might be safe to say the speculations — especially once they gain traction in the social networking circles and build up a legit “hype” — can be just as potent at driving the price of stocks up and down as they are at controlling the price of crypto.</p>
<p>Whether or not you participated in the rally, made a profit, or lost a lot of money, there are a few lessons to learn from the rally and the perils of jumping on a perilous, short-lived bandwagon.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The cons of following a hype</b></strong></h2>
<p>It’s effortless to see the <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/03/blackberry-stock-soars-over-250-then-plummets-50/"><u>Gamestop hype</u></a> as some sort of justice that retail investors are serving to the institutional investors who have been shorting Gamestop for quite a while by creating a short squeeze. This rally began from a Reddit group, and it has taken social media, and now even mainstream media, by storm, and it’s understandable why.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this year to the recent peak on Jan. 27, Gamestop stock grew by over 1,900%. That’s more than how much Bitcoin grew from its lowest point after the 2017 crash to its 2020 peak.</p>
<p>And while it was glorious for people who bought and sold at just the right moment, it caused many average investors to lose their shirts to this bet. According to an analyst, that’s what usually happens when a short squeeze meets its inevitable end. For an average investor, betting against the machine (or, more precisely, betting “late” against the machine and not pulling out on time) didn’t go very well.</p>
<p>A small minority won the short squeeze, and even though it was a different minority compared to the elites, the situation only got worse for the average investors.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The good, old long-term holdings</b></strong></h2>
<p>For average investors, playing “trader” every once in a while doesn’t bode very well. Sticking to a good long-term-holding strategy would be safer (even if it’s <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/02/shopify-inc-tsxshop-the-original-gamestop/"><u>not as explosive</u></a>). One reasonably priced stock you might consider, especially for its mouthwatering yield of 8%, is <strong><b>Timbercreek Financials </b></strong><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-tf-timbercreek-financial-corp/273410/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(TSX:TF)</a>. The payout ratio is a bit shaky at 119%, but it’s sustainable so far. And considering the payout ratio history, the company might be able to pull through without slashing its dividends.</p>
<p>The company saw its revenue growing a bit in the last quarter, and if we look back further, the company has been growing its revenues every year since 2012. The company issues a loan to commercial real estate businesses. Most of its loans are short duration, so the company doesn’t have to wait long to realize its gain. Companies like Timbercreek fill the gap left by the traditional lenders — i.e., banks — and real estate businesses seek such companies to fund many of their projects.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Foolish takeaway</b></strong></h2>
<p>One major takeaway from the Gamestop rally is that if you want to play trader or try to capture the upside of a hype that’s building, try doing it with money you can risk losing. So, if you win, you win big. But if you lose, your overall financial standing won’t suffer a severe blow.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>How I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for&nbsp;me.</strong></p>

<p>I know. I know. I know! Using my inbox as my to-do-list is considered <a href="https://www.curaytor.com/blog/Your-Inbox-is-Not-a-To-Do-List">bad practice</a>, and I should feel bad for even trying.</p>

<p>Several well known time management books explicitly advise against this approach. Based on this advice, I have tried different tools and techniques to create a to-do-list <em>separate</em> from my inbox. Yet the honest truth is that all of these attempts didn’t work nearly as well for me as my current Gmail setup.</p>

<p>I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for me. I will try to explain why and how. Perhaps it can work for you too.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-1-most-of-my-tasks-are-emailsalready">Realisation #1: Most of my tasks are emails&nbsp;already.</h2>

<p>My job revolves around communicating with people. Emails inevitably form a large part of that communication. Most of the things I get “done” get done through email. Most of the things I need to get done next will also get done through email.</p>

<p>When I try to keep a to-do-list separate from my inbox, most of the tasks that end up on that to-do-list started life as an email, or will at least result in an email eventually. Moving all of those emails to a separate to-do-list is a chore; moving them back to an email doubly so. Using my inbox as my to-do-list saves me a lot of work simply moving tasks back and forth.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all tasks start with an email. However, effective to-do-list management becomes a lot easier when all tasks are collected in <em>one place</em> (as opposed to being distributed across notebooks, sticky notes on my desk, apps on my phone, and my email).  So, since I have decided to use my inbox as my to-do-list, I need to ensure that somehow  all my tasks arrive as emails there, even those tasks that were not sent to me by other people.</p>

<p>The solution to that problem is rather straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="trick-1-i-email-tasks-tomyself">Trick #1: I email tasks to&nbsp;myself.</h3>

<p>Emailing myself about the odd task that does <em>not</em> already involve an email in my inbox feels like less work than moving everything else back and forth between two lists.</p>

<p>The great thing about this approach is that it is <em>extremely flexible</em>. Sometimes I email myself just a subject. Sometimes I write whole paragraphs of text in the body to remind myself of the details of the task.  Sometimes I add links to other things. Sometimes I reply to myself and post updates to keep track of my progress. Sometimes I carbon copy people who depend on the completion of the task, letting them know that I have documented this task and will get back to them later.</p>

<p>Inbox-as-to-do-list supports rich notes and collaborative tasks out of the box. Everyone I know already has an account and knows how to use this open platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-email-task.png" alt="A screenshot of composing an email addressed to &quot;Bob&quot; telling him it is a reminder for myself to do &quot;that thing&quot;."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-2-time-management-is-attention-management">Realisation #2: Time management is attention management.</h2>

<p>Visual clutter clutters my mind. Anything I can see can distract me. The less there is to see on the screen, the less I will be distracted. To help me focus on the most important tasks, I try to hide everything else.</p>

<h3 id="trick-2-simplifygmail">Trick #2: Simplify&nbsp;Gmail.</h3>

<p>Simplify is an awesome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj">Chrome extension</a> that simplifies the Gmail interface to the bare minimum. Most of the interface elements are useless anyway, because I use the keyboard to navigate (more on that later).</p>

<p>(I used to maintain a personal fork of Simplify that would hide <em>even more</em> of the interface - such as the giant”plus” in the bottom right of the screen - but then I realised I could just use my ad-blocker to block those specific components. Much easier, and just as effective.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-3-separate-gmail-from-thebrowser">Trick #3: Separate Gmail from the&nbsp;browser.</h3>

<p>I use Gmail through the web interface. Often I have several other tabs open at the same time. When I’m browsing, the Gmail tab distracts me. When I’m emailing, the other tabs distract me. Browsing and email are separate tasks that should live in separate apps.</p>

<p>Chrome can <a href="https://www.webnots.com/how-to-create-desktop-shortcut-of-a-site-from-google-chrome/">create a shortcut</a> to Gmail that opens as a new window. That way, Gmail behaves like a separate app, rather than just another tab.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-chrome-create-shortcut.png" alt="A screenshot of Chrome showing the menu entry to create a shortcut."></p>

<h3 id="trick-4snooze">Trick #4:&nbsp;Snooze.</h3>

<p>Tasks I do not need to focus on right now need to be out of <em>sight</em> and out of <em>mind</em>. If they are not, these currently unimportant tasks continue to take up valuable brain space, even when I am not actively working on them.</p>

<p>In my experience, there are two main ways in which a postponed task can impinge on my attention:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I see the task, I will think about the task.</em> Simply looking at a list of tasks is a great way to destroy my concentration. So many things to do! So little time!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I postpone a task, I need to know for sure that I will get back to it later.</em> This one is a bit more subtle, but nevertheless important. A postponed task tends to linger in my mind if I am not absolutely confident that I will be reminded about it later. Fear of forgetting is the mind-killer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I need a way to completely hide a task, but I also need to know that it will be back. Luckily, Gmail has a <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">“snooze” feature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Postpone emails and <strong>temporarily remove them from your inbox</strong> until you need them. Your email <strong>will come back to the top of your inbox</strong> when you want it to, whether that’s tomorrow, next week, or this evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I snooze frequently. I snooze ruthlessly. I snooze without regret.</p>

<p>Snoozing helps me avoid both of the attention traps above: the email disappears from view, and yet I can be absolutely confident that I will be reminded of it in the future, because it will come back directly to my inbox.</p>

<p>Deliberately deciding to postpone a task by actively snoozing it feels much better than pretending to ignore it for a while. Managing my own attention makes it more likely I will actually get to the task eventually. It’s not “goodbye”, it’s “see you later”.</p>

<p>Can it wait? Great!</p>

<h3 id="trick-5-disable-notifications">Trick #5: Disable notifications.</h3>

<p>Email is an asynchronous communication channel. It can usually wait a few hours. I will be checking my to-do-list several times a day in between tasks anyway. Notifications are a distraction and a waste of time.</p>

<h3 id="trick-6-close-gmail-while-working-on-atask">Trick #6: Close Gmail while working on a&nbsp;task.</h3>

<p>The purpose of a to-do-list is to help me decide what task I should be working on next. I do not need my to-do-list if I already know what I should be working on, or while I am working on a task. To avoid being distracted by other tasks on the list, or by new emails arriving in my inbox, I close Gmail while working on a task.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-3-time-spent-managing-the-tasks-is-not-spent-doing-thetasks">Realisation #3: Time spent managing the tasks is not spent doing the&nbsp;tasks.</h2>

<p>The best to-do-list is obviously an empty list with no tasks on it remaining to be done. Empty is what we should be striving for.</p>

<p>I get more things done when I spend more time doing the things to be done. I want to spend as little time as possible navigating, organising, and managing my tasks.</p>

<h3 id="trick-7-use-the-keyboard-for-navigation">Trick #7: Use the keyboard for navigation.</h3>

<p>Using a mouse requires squinting at the screen, searching for the pointer, and directing it with precision. After clicking on the compose or reply button, writing an email then requires switching context and placing both hands on the keyboard for textual input. Over the course of a day, quite a bit of time is spent just navigating around and switching context.</p>

<p>Conversely, using the keyboard for navigation relies more on muscle memory and hammering out well worn patterns (open email, delete email, archive email, snooze email, reply-all, send email, etc). In addition, there is no switching cost between the navigation and the writing of an email.</p>

<p>I avoid using the mouse as much as possible. I use <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">keyboard shortcuts</a> instead. After a few days of practice (and hitting&nbsp;<code>?</code> for the cheatsheet a lot), I never looked back. I now spend far less time navigating, and thus more time doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-shortcuts.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail Keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet."></p>

<h3 id="trick-8-dont-use-filters-orfolders">Trick #8: Don’t use filters or&nbsp;folders.</h3>

<p>I used to have filters and folders. Lots and lots of filters and folders. They were only hiding the real problem: I was getting too many emails. More emails than I could ever hope to read. Worse still, I wasn’t even sure why I was even trying just to <em>read</em> them.</p>

<p>If an email requires an action from me, it should go to my inbox so I can prioritise it. If an email does not require an action from me, I should not be getting it.</p>

<p>Do or do not, there is no FYI.</p>

<p>(I realise this trick is probably the most controversial of all the tricks listed in this post. If you very strongly disagree - and you want to explain to my why I am wrong - feel free to <a href="http://lukasvermeer.nl/#contact">send me an email</a>. You can be assured it will go straight to my inbox.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-9-use-labels-as-visualcues">Trick #9: Use labels as visual&nbsp;cues.</h3>

<p>Some tasks are more important than others. I use coloured labels to draw attention to more urgent and important tasks in my inbox.</p>

<p>My labelling scheme is intentionally simplistic. I use labels as temporary indicators, not for permanent organisation or structure. Organisation and structure are only distractions from the ultimate goal of ending up with an empty list anyway. An empty list does not need either.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-labels-urgent.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail inbox showing two emails one of which is marked as urgent."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-4-i-cannot-do-everything-today">Realisation #4: I cannot do everything today.</h2>

<p>Every morning there are more tasks in my inbox than I can reasonably hope to complete in one day. After denial, anger, bargaining, and depression comes acceptance of the simple fact that effective time management involves deliberately  deciding what <em>not</em> to spend time on.</p>

<h3 id="trick-10-start-the-day-snoozing">Trick #10: Start the day snoozing.</h3>

<p>Every morning I start my day by snoozing everything that I don’t expect to get done that day. This usually takes a few minutes scanning through my inbox. If something new and important comes up later, I immediately reevaluate if another task should now be pushed out to tomorrow. If so, I snooze without delay.</p>

<p>The reality is that I cannot do everything, so I must eventually always choose. Choosing as early as possible ensures that I will have as much time available as possible for the most important tasks. Snoozing as early as possible ensures that less important tasks take up as little of my attention as possible during the day.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I snooze rather than wait or deliberate. Snoozing is a two-way door decision: it is easily reversed. If I happen to finish all my …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>I keep getting more and more powerful laptops, and then offloading more and more processing to the cloud. SOMETHING’S GOTTA GIVE! My local machine doesn’t just run web browsers and chat apps. No, my laptop is still loaded up with dev tools, while all my virtual machines and container clusters now live in the cloud. That helps. But we’re seeing  more and more of the dev tools sneak into the cloud, too.</p>



<p>One of those dev tools is the shell experience. If you’re like me—actually, you’re probably much more advanced than me—you invest in a loaded terminal on your machine. On my Mac, I directly install a few tools (e.g. git, gcloud CLI) but use Homebrew to keep most of my favorite tools close by. </p>

<p>It’s no small effort to maintain a local terminal environment that’s up to date, and authenticated to various endpoints. To make all this easier, each of three hyperscalers now has a “cloud shell” experience that offers developers a hosted, pre-loaded terminal for working with that cloud.</p>



<p><strong>In this blog post, I’m going to look at the cloud shells from AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and see what they really have to offer.</strong> Specifically, I’m going to assess:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Shell access.</strong> How exactly do you reach and use the shell?</li><li><strong>Shells offered</strong>. Bash? Powershell?</li><li><strong>Amount of storage provided</strong>. How much can you stash in your environment?</li><li><strong>Durability period</strong>. How long does each cloud hold onto your compute environment? Storage?</li><li><strong>Platform integrations</strong>. What ways does the shell integrate with the cloud experience?</li><li><strong>Embedded tools</strong>. What comes pre-loaded in the shell?</li><li><strong>Code editing options</strong>. Is there a way to edit files or build apps?</li><li><strong>Compute environment configuration/extensibility</strong>. Can you change the shell environment temporarily or permanently?</li><li><strong>UX and usability controls</strong>. What can you do to tweak the appearance or behavior?</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a look.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Google Cloud, so obviously I’ll have some biases. That said, I’ve used AWS for over a decade, was an Azure MVP for years, and can be mostly fair when comparing products and services. Please call out any mistakes I make!</em></p>







<p>GCP offers a Cloud Shell that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works">runs within a Docker container on a dedicated Google Compute Engine virtual machine</a>. Not that you see any of that. You just see a blinking cursor.</p>



<p>How do you reach that cursor? From within the GCP Console, there’s an ever-present button in the top navigation. Of note, you can also access it via a dedicated link at <a href="https://shell.cloud.google.com/">shell.cloud.google.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you launch the Cloud Shell—and if it’s the first time, you’ll see a brief message about provisioning your infrastructure—you see a new frame on your screen. Note that this is a globally distributed service, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#zone_selection">you’re automatically assigned to the closest geographic region</a>. </p>

<p>Each user gets <strong>5GB of persistent storage</strong> that’s mounted into this underlying virtual machine. This <strong>VM terminates after 20 minutes</strong> of inactivity. If you don’t use Cloud Shell at all for 120 days, the home disk goes away too. </p>



<p>You have <strong>two default shell interpreters</strong> (Bash and sh) at your disposal here. Google Cloud Shell lets you create unique sessions via tabs, and see below that I’m using one tab to list all the shells. I was able to switch between shells, including PowerShell too!</p>

<p>Cloud Shell comes with lots of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#tools"><strong>pre-loaded tools</strong></a> including gcloud, vim, emacs, gradle, helm, maven, npm, pip, git, docker, MySQL client, TensorFlow, and Terraform. It also has built-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#language_support">language support</a> for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, and .NET Core.</p>



<p>If you want tools that aren’t pre-loaded by Google Cloud, you’ve got a few options. You can manually install tools during your session, or, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/configuring-cloud-shell#environment_customization">create a customer_environment script</a> that runs whenever your instance boots up.</p>



<p>What about <strong>platform integrations</strong>? If you call a Google Cloud API that requires credentials, there’s a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/auth">prompt for authorization</a>. There’s also an “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/open-in-cloud-shell">Open in Cloud Shell</a>” feature that makes it simple to create links that trigger opinionated Cloud Shell instances. If you’re writing tutorials or want people to try the code in your git repo, you can generate a link. There’s also a baked-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-cloudshell-command">cloudshell CLI</a> to launch tutorials, download files, and more. You can also use the gcloud CLI on your local workstation to tunnel into the Cloud Shell, thanks to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/cloud-shell">gcloud beta cloud-shell</a> operation.</p>



<p>The Google Cloud Shell also has a full-fledged <strong>code editor built in</strong>. This editor—also available directly via <a href="https://ide.cloud.google.com/">ide.cloud.google.com</a>—gets launched right from the Cloud Shell, either through the button on the Cloud Shell navigation or by invoking the <code>cloudshell edit .</code> command.</p>

<p>This editor is based on Eclipse Theia and has the Cloud Code extensions built in. This means I can create apps, use source control, link to GCP services, run tests, and more. Because Cloud Shell <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview">supports Web Preview</a>, you can also start up web applications and hit a local endpoint.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the overall <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation menu, I have options to send key combinations (e.g. Ctrl+V), change the look and feel (e.g. color, font), upload or download files, run in safe mode, restart the Cloud Shell instance, minimize the frame itself, break it out into its own window, or close the terminal entirely.</p>

<p>With this mix of free storage, a wide set of tools, a fully functional code editor, and easily extendible environments, the Google Cloud Shell feels like a very complete experience.</p>







<p>Azure provides a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell/">Cloud Shell</a> that runs on a temporary virtual machine. Like with GCP, all the infrastructure details are invisible, and users just get a virtual terminal.</p>



<p>You have a few ways to reach Azure’s Cloud Shell. There’s an always-there button in the Portal and a direct link available at <a href="https://shell.azure.com/">shell.azure.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you trigger the Cloud Shell, you quickly get a new resizable frame holding your terminal instance.</p>

<p>The compute instance is available at no charge. These instances use a <strong>5GB persistent storage</strong> image in your file share, and it appears that you pay for that. Like the Google Cloud Shell, the Azure one uses non-durable compute nodes that time out after <strong>20 minutes of inactivity</strong>.</p>



<p>You have <strong>two shell experiences</strong>: bash or PowerShell. Storage is shared between each.</p>

<p>The Azure Cloud Shell comes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/features#tools">absolutely loaded with <strong>tools</strong></a>. You have all the standard Azure tools (Azure CLI, azcopy, etc) along with things like vim, emacs, git, maven, npm, Docker, kubectl, Helm, MySQL client, PostgreSQL client, Cloud Foundry CLI, Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and more. There’s also built-in language support for Go, Ruby. .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PowerShell, and Python. I didn’t see any obvious way to customize the experience that lasts beyond a given session.</p>



<p>As far as <strong>integrations</strong>, it appears there is SSO with Azure Active Directory. There’s also a special PowerShell commandlet for managing Exchange Online. Try to control yourselves. Similar to GCP, the Azure Cloud Shell supports a URL format that lets tutorial creators launch the Cloud Shell from anywhere. Visual Studio Code users can also <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip49.html">integrate the Azure Cloud Shell into their local dev experience</a>.</p>



<p>Azure also provides a handy <strong>code editor</strong> within their Cloud Shell experience. Based on the open source Monaco editor, has a basic file explorer, command palette, and language highlighting.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation bar, you have buttons to restart the shell, configure font style and size, download files, upload files, open the code editor, trigger a local web server, minimize the frame, or shut it down. </p>



<p>All in all, it’s a solid experience. Not as rich as what GCP has, but entirely functional with nice touches like the code editor, and easy switching between bash and PowerShell.</p>







<p>AWS is the newest entrant to the cloud-based terminal with their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/">AWS CloudShell</a>. AWS seems careful to call the host a “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/vm-specs.html#vm-configuration">computing environment</a>” versus ever saying “virtual machine.” It’s possible that you get a container in a shared environment.</p>



<p>It looks like you have one way to reach the CloudShell. There’s a button in the AWS Console navigation bar. </p>

<p>There’s no cost for AWS CloudShell and you get <strong>1GB of persistent storage</strong> (also for free). The service is available in a handful of AWS regions (3 in the US, 1 in Ireland, 1 in Tokyo). Sessions expire after 20-30 minutes, and <strong>data is held for 120 days</strong>.</p>



<p>AWS CloudShell has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/working-with-cloudshell.html#using-shells"><strong>three shell experiences</strong></a> including bash, PowerShell, and z shell. </p>

<p>The AWS CloudShell comes with a handful of useful <strong>pre-loaded tools</strong>. You get the AWS tools (e.g. AWS CLI, AWS SAM), as well as git, make, ssh, and vim. You can modify the default environment by creating a .bashrc script that runs whenever the bash shell fires up. There’s native language support for Node.js and Python. </p>



<p>There’s one <strong>platform integration</strong> I noticed, which helps you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/tutorial-code-commit.html">push and pull code</a> from AWS CodeCommit. </p>



<p>There are some nice touches in the AWS CloudShell <strong>user experience</strong>. I like that you can stack tabs (session) or put them side by side. You can also download and upload files. AWS also offers settings to change the font size or switch from dark mode to light mode.</p>

<p>AWS offers a functional experience that’s basic, but useful for those living in an AWS world.</p>



<p>It’s great to see all the major clouds offering this functionality. GCP objectively has the most feature-rich experience, but each one is useful. Try them out, and see if they can make your dev environment simpler.</p>

                    <p><em>Car companies are halting production because their vendors can't supply electronic components. Laptops are struggling to meet demand because they don’t have computer chips. Mobile phone companies are having to pay through the roof to source critical parts. And it’s all happening because the world is witnessing an unprecedented semiconductor shortage. So in today’s Finshots, we talk about this and more.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>Companies dabbling with semiconductors are in a highly specialized business. They are few and far between and they spend billions of dollars planning for the future.</p><p>As we wrote in one of our articles <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/nvidia-arm-40-billion-deal/">earlier </a>—</p><blockquote>Intel spent close to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/how-intel-makes-a-chip" rel="noopener">$8.5 billion</a> in building a fabricator that could produce its flagship E5 chips. These were sophisticated enterprise-level chips and they weren’t easy to produce. The research and development cost $11.5 billion. Mistakes cost extra. And this doesn’t include time commitments. Companies have to plan years in advance to build this kind of capacity and scaling production can be quite a challenging task.</blockquote><p>So you can’t wake up one day and suddenly ramp up supply. It’s almost next to impossible to achieve this kind of scale. And the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — the largest semiconductor company in the world haven’t been investing aggressively over the past few years. As one article <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/mega-wave-capex-cycle-logic-semiconductor-industry/">notes</a> — <em>“From 2015 to 2019, the capital investment cycle remained conservative across the industry.”</em> It further goes on to add —<em> “Taking a closer look at the semiconductor capital investment trends during the past few years, it becomes clear that under-investment is the root cause of demand-supply imbalance, particularly in logic (non-memory) semiconductor industry.”</em></p><p>And that’s the crux of the problem. We didn’t think we’d need this many semiconductors. Especially the kind we use for computing stuff. The kind that goes on cars, gaming consoles, mobile phones and laptops. And it’s now pushing us to the brink. However, semiconductor companies should have jumped into action last year when it became evident that the supply lines were being stretched thin. They knew it was inevitable. And truth be told, they would have done it if it weren’t for Covid.</p><p>Expanding capacity in the middle of a pandemic isn’t exactly easy. So they were forced to defer plans. And if reports are to be believed, companies are gearing for a massive capacity building exercise this year after having struggled to expand last year. TSMC, for instance, said it would raise nearly $9 billion in a bid to expand in 2021. You’ll likely see other companies follow suit as well. So if all goes well, the problem should be alleviated by the end of 2021.</p><p>However, the current predicament isn’t a result of the supply crunch alone. Companies like Huawei, for instance, have been building semiconductor reserves over the past few years. And the pandemic forced people to spend on sophisticated consumer appliances that further dented supply lines. As an article in Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/chip-shortage-spirals-beyond-cars-to-phones-and-game-consoles">notes </a>—<em> “Industry executives also blame excessive stockpiling, which began over the summer when <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/40978Z:CH" rel="noopener">Huawei Technologies Co.</a> — a major smartphone and networking gear maker — began hoarding components to ensure its survival from crippling U.S. sanctions. Led by Huawei, Chinese imports of chips of all kinds climbed to almost $380 billion in 2020…Rivals including Apple, worried about their own caches, responded in kind. At the same time, the stay-at-home era spurred sales of home appliances from the costliest TVs to the lowliest air purifiers, all of which now come with smart, customized chips.”</em></p><p>Also, the impact of this shortage isn’t uniform across the board. The likes of Apple can negotiate better than small time vendors. Meaning, if you are in an industry that sources a lot of semiconductors then you have better bargaining power, plain and simple. Auto manufacturers unfortunately rely on third party vendors who don't source a lot of semiconductors. At least not on a relative scale. So they've been affected real bad. </p><p>Bottom Line — The semiconductor shortage is pulling multiple industries to its knees and now you know why.</p><p>Until then...</p><p>Share this Finshots on <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20semiconductor%20shortage.%20https://bit.ly/3jFyoi7">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3p2dCKB&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20semiconductor%20shortage.">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/the-great-semiconductor-shortage">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The design and implementation of programming languages fascinates me. A programming language enables a text file to both accurately communicate to another person a problem’s solution and control a computer’s execution. The influence a language’s feature set has on the way a programmer thinks about problems and their solutions is an endlessly captivating idea. The world of programming languages is amazing.</p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in implementing higher-level languages in lower-level languages. I think I was attracted to Math in school because the construction of new ideas based on a small set of axioms seems like good, clear thinking. Building up to a high-level programming language from below has the same appeal for me.</p>

<p>This article <em>may</em> be the first of many recording the scratching of an itch that apparently needs scratching. I cannot seem to ignore it even if I try. A book on Scheme or implementing interpreters or compilers always seems to find its way into my hands. I want to implement Scheme from Scratch: an interpreter, a compiler, a JIT, etc. I want to see how it all happens. If you do too then you may enjoy following along.</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This exploration is not for novice programmers. It is a tutorial introduction for novice language implementor and enthusiasts from the perspective of a novice language implementor and enthusiast.</p>

<p>You have experience programming on a UNIX or UNIX-like system. Any of Linux, BSD, or Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X is fine. You have used common developer tools like <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code>. Your copy of <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">K&amp;R&nbsp;2e</a> is a little dog eared but cherished. You might even have a copy of <a href="http://www.apuebook.com/">APUE&nbsp;2e</a>.</p>

<p>You have some prior exposure to Intel&nbsp;386 Assembly language. You don’t need to be an Assembly master. Just some general knowledge about registers, the stack and heap, and some basic instructions. Jeff&nbsp;Duntemann’s <a href="http://www.duntemann.com/assembly.htm">Assembly&nbsp;Language Step&nbsp;By&nbsp;Step</a><a>, now in its third edition, is a light and enjoyable introduction providing a sufficient level of Assembly knowledge.</a></p><p><a>If someone even mentions </a><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>, your head fills with thoughts of master magicians casting alluring spells. SICP&nbsp;2e has spent a lot of time on your bedside table and you’ve done many of the exercises when you really should have been doing other things (like I should be doing now.) SICP showed you the implementation of Scheme <em>in</em> Scheme. This chicken and egg paradox bothers you and you wonder <strong>“How do I implement Scheme from Scratch?”</strong></p>


<h2>“Scheme”</h2>

<p>There are many versions of “Scheme”. <a href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">The Original Lambda Papers</a> show various ancestors. I’ve seen threads mentioned in those papers. SICP implements several versions of Scheme. The main language used in SICP doesn’t have macros. SICP shows the implementation of a lazy Scheme. There is the official <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/busarch/1178-1990_desc.html">IEEE Scheme standard</a> and the <i>de facto</i> RnRS standards: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.39.1890">R4RS</a>, <a href="http://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>, <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a>.</p>

<p>It isn’t totally clear what makes a Scheme “Scheme”. I’m not going to worry too much about exactly what a language must have to be enough of a Scheme to earn the name. I know it needs at least s-expressions; garbage collection; symbols; first-class, lexically scoped procedures; and proper tail calls.</p>


<h2>“from Scratch”</h2>

<p>What does it mean to implement “from Scratch”? Upon what foundation will we build Scheme? Do we have a working physical computer, an operating system, an assembler, a linker, a C compiler, a Scheme interpreter or compiler, another high-level language?</p>

<p>At least to me, “from Scratch” implies building up towards Scheme from some lower-level. If a system already has another high-level language then, philosophically, why not just write programs in that language? We could, after all. So implementing Scheme with the assistance of another high-level language is out.</p>

<p>Does the system already have Scheme? No. If it did, we’d use it and you wouldn’t need to implement Scheme. (Or if the system does have Scheme, at least we’d pretend it didn’t so we could enjoy implementing it ourselves.)</p>

<p>I will assume we have working computer with a 32&nbsp;bit Intel&nbsp;386-style processor, UNIX-like operating system with an assembler and linker. These are all very interesting low-level details but building up towards a Scheme system from a level where one of these is missing is out of scope for this discussion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the grey area is whether or not the system has a C compiler or not and if we want to use that to build up to Scheme. All UNIX-like systems have a C compiler. The operating system and tools are probably written mostly in C. Many high-level languages, like Scheme, are implemented in C. Working in C is definitely working at a lower-level then working in Scheme. A testament to the low-level of C is that C is often referred to as “portable Assembly”. Given these things we can take a C compiler, <code>gcc</code>, as one of our available tools.</p>


<h2>Scheme from Scratch Implementations</h2>

<p>There are many possible ways to implement Scheme from Scratch:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Bootstrap Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A quick and <em>dirty</em> Scheme interpreter implemented in C. This should be less than 1000 lines to implement. Not many features and slow execution but enough of an interpreter to bootstrap us into the world of Scheme.</dd>

	<dt>Compiling Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A Scheme to i386 Assembly compiler written in Scheme. First executed with Bootstrap Scheme but later self compiling. See <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/">An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Compile-to-C Scheme</dt>
	<dd>A Scheme to C compiler written in Scheme. Provides great portability because C is the intermediate language on the way to machine code.</dd>
  
	<dt>Byte Code VM Scheme</dt>
	<dd>An embeddable Scheme virtual machine based on a byte-code compiler and interpreter. Written in ANSI C and very portable. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chibi-scheme/">Chibi Scheme</a>, for example.</dd>

	<dt>JIT Engine Scheme</dt>
	<dd>An embeddable Scheme engine based on a just-in-time compiler for i386 and with   sophisticated garbage collection. I’m not sure if this will be written in C or Compiling Scheme.</dd>

	<dt>Platform Scheme</dt>
	<dd>Compile Scheme to target a platform like <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/index.jsp">JVM</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ddk909ch.aspx">.NET’s&nbsp;CLR</a>, <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a>, or <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>. By targeting an existing platform, a lot of education and fun would be missed. It certainly wouldn’t count as “from Scratch”. It is necessary to write the target platform also.</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can see that it is a big itch. I don’t know how long it will take to scratch or what will come of it all but will surely be fun implementing Scheme from Scratch.</p>

 <li>It only takes four days to produce and can carry payloads of upto 100 kilos into lower earth orbit (LEO).</li>
 <li>While the first company to be successful in such an endeavour, there are others who are fast catching up and realise the value of 3D printed engines versus conventional assembly.</li>
</ul><p>Rocket engines are tough to build, and they’re even tougher to 3D print because all the details have to be ‘just right’ for the rocket to work successfully. But, an Indian space startup based out of Chennai has pulled off this mammothian task. 
</p><p>
Agnikul Cosmos has successfully fired its higher stage semi-cryogenic rocket engine called Agnilet. “This entire engine, Agnilet, is just one piece of hardware from start to finish and has zero assembled parts,” said co-founder and CEO Srinath Ravichandran.
</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1GVGbn4-U4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 

<p>Normally, rocket engines have 100s of different parts that have to be built individually. This includes things like injectors which inject fuel into the engine, cooling channels that ensure the engine doesn’t overheat and the igniter which actually kindles propellants to push the rocket off the ground.
</p>
<p>Agnilet, on the other hand, is a three-in-one solution. It takes all three of these modules and puts them into a single piece of hardware. There is no complex assembly and the turnaround time for the entire setup is less than four days. 
</p><p>    
The rocket engine is capable of carrying upto 100 kilos to low earth orbit (LEO), which is around 700 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. That’s only a fraction of what the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is capable of and possibly only enough to carry a single satellite at most.
</p><p>

<strong>Agnikul may be the first to be successful, but it’s not alone<br></strong>Agnikul was the first Indian space startup to enter into a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Department of Space (DoS) under the newly established Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe).

<p>Another space startup that’s hot its heels is Hyderabad-based Skyroot Aerospace founded by former Indian Space Research Organisation (</p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="ISRO" keynameseo="isro" actualkeyword="isro">ISRO</keyword><p>) scientists Pawan Kumar Chandana and Naga Bharath Daka. In September last year, they too revealed their fully 3D printer cryogenic rocket engine dubbed Dhawan-I. 
</p><p>
    Dhawan-I will be used to power the Vikram-II rocket, which Skyroot is also building from scratch. 
</p><p>The startup entered an NDA with the DoS earlier this month on February 2. They will be able to use ISRO’s test and launch facilities to test their Vikram-I rocket and eventually Dhawan-I as well. 
</p><p>
    The global space industry is expected to generate $1.1 trillion or more by 2040, according to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space" rel="nofollow">Morgan Stanley</a> — more than triple its current value of $350 billion. And, new space engine technology like 3D printed rocket engines are expected to play a big role in this explosion of value.
</p><p>
But even international players like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
<a target="_blank" href="https://3dprint.com/278184/startup-accelerator-ursa-major-is-3d-printing-rocket-engines-to-grow-space-economy/" rel="nofollow">Ursa Major</a> and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin are only 3D printing components for rocket engines. This means that putting together these engines and making sure they work is still a fairly complicated task. 
</p><p>The only US-based startup close to producing a fully 3D printed rocket engine is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://manufactur3dmag.com/firehawk-aerospace-raises-2-million-for-3d-printed-rocket-engines/" rel="nofollow">Firehawk Aerospace</a>, and they only just raised the $2 million needed to start on their project.

        <p><span><span></span></span> Allen Pike • February 8, 2021</p>

        

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of the doctors ever told me my Dad was dying. Not the surgeon at Maine Med who first went in to do the biopsy of the lung. Not the surgeon at Mass General who did the biopsy of a lymph node. Not the oncologist at Maine Cancer Care the first few chemo treatments, which were also the only ones I could attend thanks to COVID. None of them.</p>



<p>But they didn’t have to. Mesothelioma is hard to Google, because the search results are heavily polluted by law firms in search of riches from ignorant or irresponsible manufacturers, but you can get the gist. And the gist is that it’s not good.</p>



<p>Mesothelioma is a malignant tumor that is caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. How my father, who spent his career on Wall Street theoretically well removed from the material that used to be common in building materials, firefighting gear and the like ended up with these fibers in his lung is an open question. We’ll never know for sure, but the evidence strongly suggests that it’s a consequence of my father going back to work downtown shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#11_September_2001_attacks">WikiPedia</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>As New York City’s World Trade Center collapsed following the September 11 attacks, Lower Manhattan was blanketed in a mixture of building debris and combustible materials. This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete. More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings’ destruction.</p></blockquote>



<p>As an aside, before someone mentions the 9/11 victims fund, he was aware of it. Given the limited pool of funds, however, this was a non-starter for him because he would never have been willing to take money away from the first responders or their families. </p>



<p>Anyway, my father’s commute for four decades had him walk off the Path trains into the Trade Center en route to the Exchange every day. I know this because I did it with him one summer. He was fortunate enough to be on vacation up here in Maine not just for the attempted bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 but for 9/11 as well. It would be as tragic as it would be ironic if he survived the attack in 2001 by not being there but the air he breathed when he returned to work ended up killing him twenty years later.</p>



<p>Pragmatist that he was, however, he’d have taken that trade.</p>



<p>It’s a similar trade, in fact, to the one he took when he was first diagnosed with cancer while at Harvard Business School in the early seventies. Cancer treatments were a little less sophisticated all those years ago, and to attack the cancer that he had the doctors irradiated large swaths of his body. Today, they can apparently target areas smaller than a dime. He was told that he had an 8% chance of dying within six weeks, and a 92% chance of living out most of the rest of a normal lifespan – albeit with some side effects.</p>



<p>Side effects that he accepted without complaint. His immune system went haywire, for one, and he developed allergies, the worst of which was poison ivy. If that so much as touched him, it was in his blood stream and off to the races. My childhood memories are always a little hazy, but I remember that. The side effects changed his hair color and density, and it left him permanently immuno-compromised. It’s weird when you’re a kid and your Dad’s mustache randomly grows in bright red.</p>



<p>Not that any of that mattered much: I don’t remember him missing a single day of work, ever.</p>



<p>For fifty years, the deal that he’d accepted was a good deal. Despite a few scares along the way, the cancer never came back until he noticed being short of breath and developed a chronic cough two years ago. Never one to visit a doctor unnecessarily, and probably for good reason given his history, he nevertheless went and ended up on the track that led to the diagnosis and the year that was 2020.</p>

<p>Christmas 2019 was a sad affair. My Dad had been diagnosed merely days before, and his weight loss left him gaunt and weary. When shown pictures of the dinner later, he replied with typical bleak humor, “shit, I look dead.” Still, we tried to take an optimistic tack with 2020. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about cancer today, it’s that your primary goal if they can’t cure you immediately is to buy time, because they might be able to in future.</p>



<p>So that is what my Dad set out to do. Always goal oriented, his assessment was that based on trajectory at the time, he was unlikely to make it until the Fourth of July. Thus his goal was to make it beyond that date. To that end, he promised his oncologist one thing: that as long as they would agree to treat him, he would show up. At times, this meant employing some gamesmanship, no stranger to the lifelong athlete. As he continued to bleed weight he couldn’t afford to lose, he slyly wore heavier and heavier shoes to his weigh-in’s so they wouldn’t remove him from treatment.</p>



<p>So intent was he on continuing treatment, in fact, that he literally broke himself out of the hospital to get the toxic substance injected into his body. He’d fallen and shattered his femur – in retrospect, likely due to the fact that his heart had begun to stop unpredictably due either to a bad valve, arrhythmia’s or both. </p>



<p>All in all in 2020, he dealt with the cancer, a bad valve in his heart, a congenital heart murmur gone rogue, five surgeries, and the broken leg. To add insult to injury, his access to the thing that made him most happy – his grandchildren, and to a lesser extent his children – was drawn down to a trickle thanks to the pandemic.</p>



<p>Insult, injury or otherwise, he fought to the last. Every time he seemed to take a hard won step forward, some new fresh hell would drop him back ten steps, or even twenty. But he was a fighter, and every time he got knocked down, he picked himself up off the mat and waded back in.</p>



<p>He died as a fighter, Monday morning. And despite the terminal prognosis, the cancer never won. His body may have ultimately failed him, but his spirit never did. It was his heart, or maybe his brain, it’s not clear which, that killed him. Not the cancer. </p>

<p>That terrible endurance was something I never wanted to learn from my Dad, but I did. He taught me many other things, some of which I wrote down in an admittedly <a href="http://thisistheway.us/">lengthy letter</a> to my then unborn daughter. Here are ten that I’ve thought about this week.</p>



<h2>Have Priorities</h2>



<p>My Dad grew up with very little. What wealth his family on one side had had at one point had largely petered out, and while his father always worked, you don’t become a minister for the money. Still, the family prioritized education, and so he went to Williams like his father and brother before him, and from there it was on to Harvard Business School. That provided him with access to jobs that featured, let’s just call it, high income potential. For the first time in his life, he had money. And but for his kids, that could have been his life.</p>



<p>Instead, he eventually came to a fork in the road. Down one path lay wealth and comfort; the other was precarious, stressful self-employment as an independent floor broker – the upside of which was predictable hours that allowed him to get home in time to coach my brother and I, first in soccer, later adding lacrosse in the spring.</p>



<p>Every family has different choices to make, and I can’t imagine the financial stress both of my parents bore. But I think I can speak for my brother when I say that I’m glad he chose us.</p>



<h2>You Do What You Have To</h2>



<p>When my Dad enlisted in the army, he and my mother were dirt poor and living in a trailer in Georgia. Every dollar, therefore, was precious. As a semi-related aside, if you get the chance, ask my Mom what it was like to work at a K-Mart in the deep south with a wicked Boston accent.</p>



<p>Anyway, after finding out that paratroopers got an extra pittance per month, my Dad signed up for jump school. The only problem with this transaction was that my Dad was terrified of heights. Every morning he had to jump, then, he’d get up and vomit because he was scared. But dollars were precious, so he got his wings.</p>



<p>Later, in business school, he had to go in regularly to get blasted with high doses of radiation. This had the intended effect of killing off the cancer and the unintended effect of giving him nearly full time nausea. He didn’t intend to miss class, however, so he merely requested a seat on the aisle so he could get to the bathroom quickly. All professors but one complied; the hold out required an appeal to the dean. He had no such impediments while competing in tennis tournaments during treatment, however; he’d merely vomit in between sets.</p>



<p>My Dad never really sat us down to talk about working through fear, sickness or injury. We just watched him.</p>



<h2>Be Yourself</h2>



<p>All the years my Dad worked on the various exchanges, he dressed – in general – as comfortably as the dress code permitted. He had nice suits and ties when they were needed, but his normal uniform was LL Bean chinos, a plain white shirt, his trading jacket and one of a couple of ties kept in his desk. That was who he was. My Dad paid no more attention to NYC fashion then he did to bars after work or coke in the bathrooms. His worst vice was coke, the soda.</p>



<p>It never occurred to me that this was in some way different or unique until I moved to New York City after college. Some friends had Armani suits and Gucci loafers. I was much more likely to be the one who kept us from getting into a bar because I was dressed like a 1930’s rail-riding hobo.</p>



<p>Like my Dad, for better or for worse, I knew who I was, and I never worried too much about what everyone else was up to.</p>



<h2>Let Your Kids Be Who They Are</h2>



<p>My Dad was an athlete all his life, and a very good one. Great, even. My brother and I grew up on stories of his freak athleticism, how he started on his college …</p></div></div>

February 9, 2021 | https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Startups and technology canâ€™t solve <em>all</em> the worldâ€™s problems, but they can solve a good amount of them. Now more than ever, we need people to build the next generation of companies that will tackle some of the worldâ€™s biggest problems. There are a lot of unknowns right now, but at Wilbur Labs, we believe this is the best time to start a company â€“ ever. </p><p>Wilbur Labs is a startup studio turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. Since 2016 we have built and invested in 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>, and more.</p><p>We plan to launch several companies every year, which requires building a solid pipeline of ambitious ideas. Over the years, we have used three primary approaches to get startup ideas: build for the future, solve existing problems better, or solve personal problems.</p></div><h2>1. Build for the Future</h2><div><div><p>The future is not static. It is built by people who have a vision for what the future should look like, and those who have the willingness to work hard and take the risks necessary to get there. A great way to get startup ideas is to sit down and think about what the future should look like. Ask yourself the following questions: </p><p><em>How are behaviors changing? Which changes will stick? </em><br><em>What long-term problems have been created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? </em><br><em>What priorities and values have changed?</em><br><em>What are the biggest problems today?</em><br><em>What will be the biggest problems tomorrow?</em><br><em>What new problems can technology solve today?</em><br><em>How can new technology change the way existing problems are solved?</em></p></div><p>2020 is a year that consumer behaviors are changing and evolving at a faster rate than ever before. Emerging trends that would have taken 5 to 10 years to mature are instead maturing overnight. There is a large opportunity to think about changing trends and build companies ahead of the curve. eCommerce, Employment, Insurance, and Mobile On-Demand are just a few industries where we are boosting investments as a result of new long-term trends.</p><p>When thinking about the future, itâ€™s important to think and plan for the long-term. The best ideas can be built into big, sustainable businesses that can solve problems and create value over the long-term. Avoid short-termism, also known as ideas which may seem solid in the short-term but have a short expiration date.</p><p>Barkbus is a great example of a business that is building for the future. Back in 2017, the world was rapidly transitioning to direct-to-your-door services. Despite that, the way most people got their dogs groomed hadnâ€™t changed. Pet parents still went to the salon, which was a time consuming and stressful experience for both dogs and their parents. Barkbus launched to <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/announcements/why-we-acquired-barkbus">make mobile grooming the new norm</a> for pet parents and their dogs. </p></div><h2>2. Solve Existing Problems Better</h2><div><p>We believe the best companies solve real problems. These problems may be completely new problems, or they may be existing problems that have not been solved well by existing companies to date.</p><p>Do not discount existing problems when generating startup ideas. Some of the largest, most impactful companies throughout history were built by solving existing problems better than others. Google did not invent the search engine, search ads, web based email, or maps. Apple did not invent the smartphone, the tablet, or the smart watch. Facebook did not invent social networking. The list goes on and on. What these companies did is provide a better experience than the existing companies. At Wilbur Labs, we refer to this as â€œcreating a 10x experience.â€� </p><p>Next time you have an idea and someone says, â€œdoesnâ€™t X do that?â€� â€” instead of throwing away your idea, first decide if thereâ€™s an opportunity to 10x the experience. Competitors are a good sign as it means there is a real problem people care about. Challenging the status quo is a great way to solve big problems and build a large business. </p><p>When we built Joblist, we did so because despite multiple large job boards, the job search process hasnâ€™t changed in 20 years â€” when job listings first moved online. We saw an opportunity to 10x the job search experience by introducing more personalization and collaboration tools to a traditionally generic and lonely process. Job seekers have embraced this new approach, which allowed Joblist to help millions of job seekers by powering over 500,000 new applications <a href="https://www.joblist.com/news/why-we-launched-joblist">before their public launch</a>.</p></div><h2>3. Solve Personal Problems</h2><div><div><p>Many of the best startup ideas are personal problems that you have faced. What are the biggest problems that you wish were solved? How many others face the same problem? If you experience a problem, then you are uniquely positioned to solve it.</p><p>More often than not, entrepreneurship is not a way to get rich quickly. You will likely need to work harder and longer, with higher stress and more at stake than working a regular job. The journey is absolutely worth it for the right person, but itâ€™s important that you care enough about what you are working on enough to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life. This will be easier if you care deeply about the problem you are solving.</p></div>
<p>A great example of this is why we launched VacationRenter. At Wilbur Labs, we had quarterly company offsites where we book a vacation rental to work for a few days in a different city. Every time we searched for a rental, it took hours of planning and work. We found ourselves scrolling through pages of search results and jumping from site to site, trying to find the ideal place for the best price. This was a frustrating experience and we knew we could make the search for a vacation rental better for others like us â€” which is why <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/news/why-we-launched-vacationrenter">we launched VacationRenter</a>. If you experience a problem, it is likely that others are experiencing it too. </p>
<p>VacationRenter became the fastest growing travel startup ever, generating over $1 billion gross bookings in 2020. This milestone confirms that we werenâ€™t the only travelers who had a frustrating experience finding the perfect rental.</p></div><h2>Next Steps</h2><div><p>At Wilbur Labs, the best startup ideas check a few key boxes:</p><ul><li><strong>Solves a problem.</strong> Could your idea solve a big problem, and have a large positive impact on a significant number of people?</li><li><strong>Builds a sustainable business. </strong>Can the idea be turned into a sustainable business that creates value over the long-term?</li><li><strong>Uniquely positioned.</strong> Are you uniquely positioned to solve the problem and you want to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life?</li></ul></div><figure><img alt="best-startup-ideas-venn-diagram" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/ideas-venn-diagram.png"></figure><div><p>No matter how good an idea is, we believe that ideas alone are worthless unless you take initiative to execute. Execution is everything. Everyone has big ideas â€” no startup ideas are truly unique. Being able to execute on those ideas is what will turn that idea into a business.</p><p>For any idea, the most important next step is thorough research where you pair your initial idea with independent and external information.

          <p><small>Posted by Matthew Wild on February 9 2021</small></p><p><em>There is a significant difference between developing and promoting a
protocol (such as XMPP) and a product (such as Signal). Both approaches
have their advantages and disadvantages. This post details how and why
Snikket aims to strike a balance between the two.</em></p>
<h2 id="products-vs-protocols">Products vs Protocols</h2>
<p>This past weekend I gave a talk at the (virtual) FOSDEM conference about
a topic I’ve been thinking about a lot the past few years - the differences
between developing a product and developing a protocol.</p>
<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://peertube.thepacket.exchange/videos/watch/96e35d83-e70c-4a87-868b-f9cbeb48e1d0">here</a>, but there were many things I
wanted to touch upon that wouldn’t fit into the 20 minute slot. This post
will cover the same topics, but expands on some of the points I
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="previously-in-open-protocols">Previously, in open protocols…</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (once known as Jabber) for over 15
years. It is now over 20 years since XMPP’s inception, and over this
time XMPP, along with the rest of the tech industry, has seen significant
change.</p>
<p>XMPP began life in the late 1990s, as an attempt to break into the
messaging silos of that era. The names and logos may have been different,
but it was a very similar landscape to today - oversized tech companies
fighting each other for control over people who simply want to use the
internet for what it was designed, communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Email got lucky. A standard protocol managed to break down the walls of
even the final fortress of resistance, AOL. This was achieved largely
because the adoption of standard protocols by smaller providers allowed
them to form a network together that began to threaten even America’s
largest ISP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we never quite reached that point with instant messaging.
However that hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to strive for a
similar outcome even as our symbol of hope, the open email network, is
under threat today more than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite numerous projects, communities and organizations campaigning for
decades in favour of open messaging systems, the space is still
dominated by large silos. The largest the world has ever known. WhatsApp
alone has over <em>2 billion</em> users. That means a significant portion of
the world’s communications are flowing through a single company. A
company that has a simple business model - amassing data about people
and leveraging that data to help their actual customers (other
businesses) influence the beliefs, biases and behaviour of the users of
their platforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-slippery-slope">The slippery slope</h2>
<p>Despite the dizzying numbers associated with WhatsApp today, it had more
humble beginnings. Founded by two ex-Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and
Jan Koum, it began as a simple messaging app for iPhones. The server was
originally based on an <a href="https://www.process-one.net/blog/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">open-source XMPP server</a>, and
used the XMPP protocol. However the goal of WhatsApp was not openness
and federation, and they soon diverged far from standard XMPP.</p>
<p>As WhatsApp grew, early users may recall that they also began charging a
small fee for accounts ($1/year). Their reasoning was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>â€œRemember, when advertising is involved <strong>you the user</strong>
    are the product.</p>
    <p>Your data isn't even in the picture. We are simply not interested in any of it.</p>
    <p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp,
    we say â€˜Have you considered the alternative?â€™â€œ</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/why-we-don-t-sell-ads">
         <strong>WhatsApp blog post â€œWhy we don't sell adsâ€œ, June 2012</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, just two years later it was announced that WhatsApp had
been acquired by the internet’s fastest-growing advertising platform,
Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite declaring to the EU competition commission that linking an
individual’s data between WhatsApp and Facebook was not technically
feasible this is exactly what they went on to do, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/facebook-fined-eu-whatsapp-european-commission">leading to a â‚¬94
million fine</a>. Little by little, Facebook has been
loosening their privacy policies to allow them to absorb WhatsApp data
into their daily operations.</p>
<p>So when, in early 2021, the latest update to the privacy policy gave users
of the platform a clear ultimatum to allow this sharing or close their
account, many users wisely began to seek alternatives. Finally, the
moment we had been waiting for had arrived.</p>
<p>Many of us advocates of open communications seized the opportunity, and
recommendations were soon flying around for the wide range of alternative
messaging systems we’ve been building these past years. “Use XMPP!”,
“Use Matrix!”, “Use Signal!”, to name a few.</p>
<p>Despite a marked increase of signups on XMPP and Matrix servers, of
these three it was Signal that won by far the largest share of new users.
Millions of people flocked from WhatsApp and overloaded Signal’s servers,
resulting in disrupted message delivery across Signal’s service for days.</p>
<p>This service disruption was possible because, unlike XMPP and Matrix,
Signal is centralized, and all messages flow through a single set of
servers, the same model as WhatsApp.</p>
<p>XMPP and Matrix are both federated networks. Rather than a single entity
controlling the network, there are many servers to choose from, run by
many different independent providers. Even with a server down,
overloaded or closed to new users, the rest of the network continues
functioning.</p>
<p>So why did Signal receive millions of users, and XMPP/Matrix did not?</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>At this point it’s impossible not to reference <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The Ecosystem is Moving</a>,
a 2016 blog post by Signal’s founder and CEO, Moxie Marlinspike. In this
post Moxie details all the problems he sees with protocols becoming
open internet standards. In particular, that they lose their ability to
evolve, and that evolution is vital to compete in our industry’s “moving
ecosystem”.</p>

    <p>We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there
       until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly
       frozen in time circa the late 1990s.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well. Far from being frozen in time, XMPP has changed significantly in the past
20 years.</p>

    <img src="https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/xmpp_2004_2021.png">

<p>Just some of the things we have now that we didn’t have in the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption using OMEMO (based on Signalâ€™s protocol and
audited), with multi-device and offline capabilities</li>
<li>Audio/video calling (now 2nd generation, encrypted, WebRTC-compatible)</li>
<li>Mobile optimizations (bandwidth, connectivity, push notifications)</li>
<li>Full cross-device message synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these things didn’t even exist as concepts back when XMPP began.
Adding them was only possible due to XMPP’s smart design: a core
protocol, with a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">suite of extensions</a> (known as XEPs). New
extensions are added as needed, and irrelevant ones get deprecated.</p>
<p>To help keep everyone on the same page as the protocol evolves, the XMPP
Standards Foundation (XSF) annually publishes the recommended XEPs that
different classes of software (e.g. instant messaging,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/social.html">social networking</a>, or <a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html">smart devices</a>) should be
implementing. These round-ups are known as <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites.html">compliance suites</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation site <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/">Modern XMPP</a> also serves as a useful reference
guide for modern XMPP implementations (including UI/UX considerations,
which are not covered by the protocol-level documentation).</p>
<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth">The unfortunate truth</h2>
<p>The effort required in advancing the protocol <em>is</em> significant. And that’s
not even counting the implementation work. XMPP has a diverse and open
ecosystem. There is no single “XMPP client”, instead the ecosystem is
composed of… just about anyone who decides to write XMPP software. The
vast majority of this software is free/open-source, and developed by
volunteers and communities.</p>
<p>Publishing protocol updates does not magically mean the changes are
implemented in all XMPP software overnight. Some projects are more active
than others, and each contributor is an individual with their own life
and work schedule. Unfortunately this means that it’s very difficult to
evolve the protocol and keep everyone 100% in sync. Luckily XMPP’s
modular design makes it easy for some software to advance ahead of others
without having to lose backwards compatibility with the rest of the
network. If we didn’t have this feature, we would always be in a state where
half of the network is unable to communicate with the other half of the
network, or more likely we would be stuck with the initial set of
features because nobody would want to be the first ones to become
incompatible with everyone else.</p>
<p>But Moxie is right. We could move <strong>much</strong> faster if we didn’t care about
interoperability, software diversity, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And that is the approach Signal is taking.</p>
<h2 id="product-or-protocol">Product or protocol?</h2>
<p>It’s clear that there are trade-offs to be made here. Signal’s
product-led development excludes others from participating in the Signal
network. But it allows them to remain agile, and implement new features
as fast as they can write and ship code.</p>
<p>I put together some of the trade-offs into the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Building an ecosystem</th>
<th>Building a product</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus on protocol</td>
<td>Focus on implementation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly documentation</td>
<td>Mostly code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-project collaboration</td>
<td>Single project/team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building for developers</td>
<td>Building for end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slow evolution</td>
<td>Evolves as fast as you want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve diversity</td>
<td>Achieve a monoculture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robust</td>
<td>Single point of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think that Signal’s approach is laudable for the number of people that
they have helped divert from data-mining platforms, and helping to remind
people that surveillance capitalism isn’t the only way to do things.</p>
<p>They’ve built a good user-friendly product, and they have done it with
security and privacy at its heart.</p>
<p>But we have to aspire to more than this. Signal is a centralized, closed
system. That means to communicate with your contacts who use Signal, you
must also consent to their terms, their software, their US jurisdiction.
You have to be okay with their servers being hosted with large cloud
providers such as Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>But one thing the past has shown us is that things change. Technologies
evolve, business leaders come and go, motives adjust. Signal today may
be as benign as WhatsApp before its acquisition by Facebook. But …</p></div></div>

                                    <p>Most of the visual cortex studies I’ve read have been about mammalian vision. But mammals are not the only organisms with cortex, or at least tissue resembling cortex. This paper explores <em>turtle</em> visual cortex, in an area known as dCx. This dorsal region plays the role of the turtle primary vision center — as close as you can find to the homolog of human V1.</p>

<p>But unlike V1, Fournier &amp; Müller et al confirm the existing knowledge that while dCx receives direct inputs from LGN, its layout is <em>not</em> retinotopic. They expand upon this understanding by recording from both individual cells (with electrophysiological recording) and populations of cells. They show that, aside from some slight preferences of caudal dCx for rostral LGN inputs (and vice versa), dCx doesn’t have any clear layout pattern.</p>

<p>This is interesting because the simple, three-layer cortex of a reptile is a much simpler substrate for understanding vision than the complex, deep cortex of mammals. What, if not “pixel-level” information, is dCx responding to?</p>

<p>While the turtles watched movies, the researchers watched the turtles. In particular, they noticed that certain cells of dCx responded to <em>scene-level</em> stimuli: When there was a cut, or the film started or stopped, there was a burst of activity. When the same stimulus was played repeatedly, these responses died away.</p>

<p>This style of scene-level parsing in mammals is reserved for “later”, down-stream brain areas. Does this mean that turtles are using dCx as both early signal processing as well as higher-level object recognition and interpretation? If so, does this mean that mammalian brains, with discrete areas for low-level and high-level vision, evolved from an earlier system where all of these tasks were colocated?</p>

<p>Debian is a rock solid GNU/Linux distribution with more than 30,000 packages available in its official repositories. Debian is suitable for servers, workstations, mobile devices and embedded systems.</p>
<p>Debian has a simple and clean installation system which allows installing Debian with little effort as long as the number of installations to be executed is minimal, but as this number grows the installation procedure becomes cumbersome and tedious (Please note that during the installation process it is necessary to answer configuration questions and package selection), for example if we want to install Debian in a lab that has 15 workstations, we need to repeat this process 15 times, which is possible , but if we want to deploy Debian in mass, for example 100, 200, 500 or 1000 installations, it is no longer feasible, this is the reason why the Debian developers have created a system that allows automatic or unattended installations starting from a configuration file (preseed).</p>
<p>There are three methods that can be used to execute an unattended installation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding the preseed file to the installer’s <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initrd.gz</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed#Adding_the_preseed_file_to_the_installer.27s_initrd.gz">link</a></li>
<li>Add the file boot parameter to the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ManipulatingISOs#remaster">ISO image</a></li>
<li>Load the preseed.cfg file from the network

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post we’re going to use method 1 for unattended installation starting from <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso">DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso</a></p>
<h2 id="dowload-debian-image">1. Dowload Debian image</h2>
<p>We will download the “net-install” image that allows a minimal installation, an internet connection is needed since the files are downloaded from Debian repositories.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -LO# https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso
</code></pre>
<p>Recommended reading: <a href="https://www.librebyte.net/en/internet-browsers/as-download-files-using-curl/">How to download files using curl</a></p>
<h2 id="install-xorriso">2. Install xorriso</h2>
<p><strong>xorriso</strong> allows  to extract files from an ISO image and dump into the file system</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt -y install xorriso
</code></pre>

<p>With the following command we put the files contained in the “net-install” image into the file system under the isofiles DIR if the isofiles DIR does not exist, xorriso creates it automatically.</p>
<pre><code>$ xorriso -osirrox on -indev debian-10.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso  -extract / isofiles/
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dowload-a-base-preseed">4. Dowload a base preseed</h2>
<p>A basic template is available from Debian site which serves as a starting point for our unattended installation system.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -#L https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/example-preseed.txt -o preseed.cfg
</code></pre>

<h2 id="modify-preseed-template-according-our-needs">5. Modify preseed template according our needs</h2>
<h3 id="setting-the-locale">5.1. Setting the locale</h3>
<p>Set operating system language to English, UTF-8 encoding and locale settings (date, currencies) to English U.S.</p>
<pre><code>d-i debian-installer/language string en
d-i debian-installer/country string US
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US.UTF-8
</code></pre>
<h3 id="setting-the-timezone">5.2. Setting the timezone</h3>
<p>Set the hardware clock to UTC and set the timezone to America/New_York (we can use any value found on <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo/</code>) and use <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> for time synchronization.</p>
<pre><code>d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true
d-i time/zone string America/New_York
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true

<h3 id="configure-the-keyboard">5.3.  Configure the keyboard</h3>
<p>Set the keyboard to US.</p>
<pre><code>d-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap select us
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-the-network">5.4. Configure the network</h3>
<p>With the following configuration the installation system will try to configure the network automatically, set the hostname to debian10, set localdomain as domain name and use the <code>http.us.debian.org</code> as  mirror it is also possible to specify a proxy which in this case is empty.</p>
<pre><code>d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string debian10
d-i netcfg/get_domain string localdomain
# Avoid to show WEP dialog
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string
d-i mirror/country string manual
d-i mirror/http/hostname string http.us.debian.org
d-i mirror/http/directory string /debian
d-i mirror/http/proxy string
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-users">5.5. Configure users</h3>
<p>We disable the the root user authentication user, instead we will use <code>sudo</code> with a standard user with encrypted password.</p>
<pre><code>d-i passwd/root-login boolean false
d-i passwd/user-fullname string Ponga Aqui el nombre completo del usuario a crear
d-i passwd/username string nombre_de_usuario
d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password Ponga aqui la contraseña encryptada
</code></pre>
<p>To encrypt the password you can execute the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 <span>-</span>c <span>'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("mipass", crypt.METHOD_SHA512))'</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="partitioning">5.6. Partitioning</h3>
<p>We’re going to use <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager">LVM</a> as partition method, <strong>any old partition will be removed</strong>, the selected partition scheme is <code>atomic</code> that means use the the entire hard disk for a single partition, another options are: home (living in its own partition) and multi (separate partitions for /home, /var, /tmp).</p>
<pre><code>d-i partman-auto/method string lvm
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max
</code></pre>
<p>Avoid that partman asks for  confirmation to continue with the partition process.</p>
<pre><code>d-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
d-i partman/confirm boolean true
d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

A few years ago we worked with Leif Segerstam, a composer/conductor
from Finland. He had a remarkably creative way of using the English
language, and as usual, I started writing my favourite quotes in our music.
After a few days, I learned that several other members of the
orchestra were doing the same thing.  This is a compilation of our
efforts. 
<p>
Unlike the collected quotations of another famous conductor, these
aren't just the fractured phrases of someone who speaks English as
a second language - we have before us a record of the creative mind
of a kaleidescopic flexator electrifically fluxating new meaning into
a tired old language.

<!-- make the list of quotations double spaced -->


</p><ul>
<li>Could we have a relativity normal beginning?
</li><li>Take ``La Forza Del Destino'' and half it.
</li><li>I want the music more traumatised.
</li><li>Like an old time Western locomotive we can get the organity of the puffing.
</li><li>The kaleidescopic flexator on the podium --- the conductor.
</li><li>Keep an irony rhythm.
</li><li>You are still mauving.
</li><li>The string section without the basses is a plasmatic living cluster.

</li><li>Flutterzungen in the mind. 

</li><li>Was this a conspiration to read my beat?
</li><li>Just play in your box until you come to the climax. . .   so that we hear the clappering.
</li><li>. . .  if you get music early in your brainal functions.
</li><li>The old quarter note becomes very freshly enough the new quarter note.
</li><li>You could take a speed of 33 metronome, or 22.
</li><li>A dividing 50 percent reaction tempo-wise.
</li><li>The quintuplet should be freshly and rudely the same as the triplet.
</li><li>I am in 76 of this here.
</li><li>Still together, conductified.
</li><li>Could I have something which is close to that which is underneath the pencil?
</li><li>The atmospheric things must have a millimetre to do with the speed.
</li><li>The winds can rehearse the length of the teedle-eedle-boom.
</li><li>Something is satelliting out of the control of the beated music.
</li><li>I have words for everything that can be expressed.

<p>Matrix is an open standard and communication protocol for real-time communication. It aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service, by allowing users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, voice over IP, and videotelephony. Such protocols have been around before such as XMPP but Matrix is not based on that or another communication protocol. From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)">Wikipedia</a></p>

February 9, 2021 | https://markjames.dev/2021-02-09-iracing-telemetry-fsharp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://markjames.dev/2021-02-09-iracing-telemetry-fsharp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>During the pandemic, I’ve been spending quite a bit of time playing <a href="https://iracing.com/">iRacing</a> in VR. I love the realism of iRacing (and how well it supports VR!), and managed to score a win in the Mazda MX-5 this season at the (sadly) now defunct Oran Park Raceway near Sydney.</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/race-result-mazda.png" width="600" height="150" alt="First place at Oran Park Raceway"></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-08-writing-an-iracing-sdk-implementation-fsharp/">previous post</a>, I discussed how I was looking to create an F# library for the iRacing SDK. This proved to be a bigger challenge than I thought as the iRacing API uses a memory mapped file and I’m not yet familiar enough with F# to be tackling the problem yet.</p>

<p>As an alternative (and thanks to F#’s interoperability with C# and the .NET platform), I decided to familiarize myself with this <a href="https://github.com/NickThissen/iRacingSdkWrapper">C# iRacing SDK</a> and build a small app that gathers some basic telemetry data and writes it to a CSV file which I could then plot in a .NET Interactive Notebook using Plotly.NET. The end result of my first few tests looked like this:</p>


    
        <!-- Plotly.js -->
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=11">
        
        
    
    
      
     
    


<p>The entire process was refreshingly simple, but there were a few things that had stumped me as I had still been thinking in C# (which I’m more familiar with). For example, here’s the code which listens to an event from the iRacing SDK and then calls a function which parses and then writes telemetry data to a CSV:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Get the current speed in m/s and convert to a rounded km/h.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getSpeed</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>Speed</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>

    <span>speedRounded</span>

<span>// Get the throttle input and round it.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>throttleValue</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>throttle</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>Throttle</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>

    <span>roundedThrottle</span>

<span>// Get the lapdistance and round it.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getLapDistance</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>distance</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>LapDistPct</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>roundedDistance</span> <span>=</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>Round</span> <span>(</span><span>distance</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>roundedDistance</span>

<span>// Append the output of the current tick to a CSV file.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>dataToWrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>"{getSpeed evArgs},{evArgs.TelemetryInfo.Gear.Value},{throttleValue evArgs},{evArgs.TelemetryInfo.Lap.Value},{getLapDistance evArgs}</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
    <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>AppendAllText</span> <span>(</span><span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span><span>,</span> <span>dataToWrite</span><span>)</span>
    <span>printfn</span> <span>"Wrote to CSV"</span>

<span>let</span> <span>start</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// Bind an instance of iRacing SdkWrapper to iRacing</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span>
    <span>// Listen to the iRacing telemetry updates</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Observable</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first thing to note is the structure of the code. F# code is structured from the bottom up (the same applies for files in a project), and I find that this helps with readability and reasoning about the code.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is how to set the update frequency (in updates per second). In C#, we would update a variable to set the telemetry update frequency like so:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2.0</span><span>;</span> <span>// Updates per second</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, In F#, we bind names to expressions as opposed to assigning variables. Then how can we set an update frequency for the C# library without using a mutable? The answer is simple, pass it in as a parameter to the SdkWrapper constructor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>// Receive events at a rate of two updates/sec.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, note the use of Observable.subscribe to listen to an event. In C#, we would likely do something like this to subscribe to the event using an event handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Program</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>Sdkwrapper</span> <span>iracing</span><span>;</span>

    <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>    
        <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>;</span>
        <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span> <span>+=</span> <span>OnTelemetryUpdated</span><span>;</span>
        <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>OnTelemetryUpdated</span><span>(</span><span>object</span> <span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Use live telemetry</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In F#, we subscribe to the event using Observable.subscribe and call our writeToCsv function each time the event is fired:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Observable</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interop between C# and F# events is nice, and I find this solution to be quite elegant. In addition, you also have Observable.scan which accumulates state each time an event has fired. I haven’t had to do that in this example, but you can see <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/concurrency-reactive/">more details here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plotting-the-telemetry-data">Plotting the Telemetry Data</h2>

<p>Now that we have a backend system logging some telemetry data from the sim, the next step is to plot the graph we saw above. In order to do so, I created a new .NET Interactive notebook in VS Code Insiders. I then imported the libraries I needed and wrote the following initial code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>FilePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span>

<span>type</span> <span>rawCsv</span> <span>=</span> <span>CsvProvider</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FilePath</span><span>,</span> <span>HasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>// CSV File</span>
<span>let</span> <span>lapPerformance</span> <span>=</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>.</span><span>GetSample</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The use of [&lt;Literal&gt;] here is because FilePath must be a constant so that the CsvProvider can read the data while we’re developing. As I mentioned in a previous article on <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-23-plotting-csv-files-fsharp/">CSV files in F#</a>, “Type providers are a blessing and curse in F#. On one hand, they’re amazing, because you get compile-time types for your data! But, that also means the data must be available at compile time. You can usually work around this by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including representative data inside your project’s git repo, so you can build the provider based on sample data and then parse any conforming input data</li>
  <li>Using a string literal in source code to define sample data and use that for the provider (which is what I’ve done here).”</li>
</ul>

<p>I also added some column headers into my CSV file (in the future, I plan to write these automatically in the backend code). We also create a new CsvProvider, and then get the data by calling GetSample() on the raw CSV file.</p>

<p>Next, let’s write the createChart function and then pass it out formatted CSV file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>createChart</span><span>(</span><span>lapPerformance</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> 

    <span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>lapPerformance</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Seq</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>row</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Lap</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>speed</span>
    <span>// Map Lap Distance and Speed to X and Y on the line chart.</span>

    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withMargin</span><span>(</span><span>Margin</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>120</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>150</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withSize</span> <span>(</span><span>900</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>600</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Show</span>
    
<span>createChart</span><span>(</span><span>lapPerformance</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first thing I do is make use of a higher order function, Seq.filter in order to only include lap two for plotting. Thanks to type providers, we can reference columns (e.g. row.Lap) directly while developing! I find this super handy as I no longer need to reference the file itself to figure out which columns are which.</p>

<p>Next, we construct a pipeline using the forward piping operator (|&gt;) to map the lap distance and speed variables as X and Y values on a line chart, and then define how the chart should be styled. I really like the forward piping operator, and I find that it produces some really clean and concise code.</p>

<h2 id="exploratory-data-with-deedle">Exploratory Data with Deedle</h2>

<p>For a project at work, I’ve been exploring the use of <a href="https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/">Deedle</a> as an alternative to Python’s Pandas, and it could be a good library to make use of here to explore telemetry data in greater detail.</p>

<p>The first thing I tried using Deedle, was seeing what my average lap speed was across laps 1-4 at the Laguna Seca Racetrack:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>lapCsv</span> <span>=</span> <span>Frame</span><span>.</span><span>ReadCsv</span><span>(</span><span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span><span>,</span> <span>hasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>lapCsv</span><span>.</span><span>GetColumn</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>"Speed"</span><span>)</span>
<span>speed</span> 
<span>|&gt;</span> <span>Stats</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span>
<span>|&gt;</span> <span>printf</span> <span>"Average speed: %A Km/h"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The results were:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Average speed:
121.036 Km/h
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this example, we’re loading our CSV file into a Deedle Dataframe, and then binding the Speed column to speed. Next, we make use of pipeline operator to get the mean of the column and print that to the console.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Although there are much better telemetry systems out there, working on my own simple version has allowed me to better see the differences between C# and F#, while at the same time seeing how I can use C# libraries in F# in order to accomplish different tasks. In addition, It would be a good idea to buffer the output as opposed to writing to the file each tick, but since its only two updates per second and doesn’t need to scale, I’m okay with leaving it as is for now.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the next step is to parse the CSV file and then plot several laps together to analyze breaking points and speed on the straights to see if I can improve on any specific areas of the track.</p>

<p>Lastly, thanks to F# great interop with C#, I’m not so sure that there’s a need to port the library to F#, and I might instead look towards some other areas of F# where there’s more of a need for a library.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>A lack of competition and transparency in the digital advertising technology supply chain is impacting publishers, advertisers and consumers and needs to be addressed, according to the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-advertising-services-inquiry/interim-report">interim report</a> for the ACCC’s Digital advertising services inquiry, released today.</p>

<p>The report examines the digital display advertising supply chain in Australia, which enables the near instantaneous delivery of $3.4 billion of digital display advertising opportunities on news, entertainment and other websites and apps each year. Digital advertising is, in essence, how consumers’ attention and data are monetised. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Advertising technology, or ad tech, has significantly transformed the way that advertising is delivered to consumers online. As consumers live more of their lives online, ad tech plays an increasingly critical role in the advertising market and the wider digital economy,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“But there is a real lack of competition, choice and transparency in this industry. These issues add to the cost of advertising for businesses, which will ultimately impact the prices paid by consumers.”</p>

<p>While there are many ad tech providers in Australia, Google is by far the largest provider of all of the key ad tech services examined by the report, and is the only provider across the full ad tech supply chain that also sells ad inventory. The ACCC estimates that Google’s share of the revenue or ads traded in each of the required services in Australia ranges from 50-60 per cent to between 90-100 per cent, depending on the service.</p>

<p>Over time, Google has made a series of acquisitions that have cemented its strong position in the ad tech supply chain, which is further reinforced by its unrivalled access to data from its wide range of consumer-facing services, including Google Search, Chrome and Android, and from its wide network of trackers on third-party websites and apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Google’s significant presence across the whole ad tech supply chain, combined with its significant data advantage, means Google is likely to have the ability and the incentive to preference its own ad tech businesses in ways that affect competition,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“During this inquiry we have heard concerns from parties about potential conflicts of interest from Google’s various roles in this industry. This includes Google very often acting on behalf of both publishers and advertisers for the same ad sale across the ad tech supply chain, while also selling its own ad inventory.”</p>

<p>Google-owned YouTube’s ad inventory is sold exclusively through Google’s own platforms. Advertisers who consider YouTube ads essential to their advertising strategy must use Google’s ad tech services to buy these ads.</p>

<p>Google also does not participate in header bidding auctions run by publishers, in which they offer ad inventory for sale to advertisers in a real-time bidding process. Instead, Google’s publisher ad server developed its own proprietary Open Bidding auctions, which means publishers who wish to receive real-time bids from advertisers using Google’s ad tech services must use Google’s publisher ad server.</p>

<p>The ACCC has also heard concerns about the competitive effect of Google’s restrictions on rivals’ access to different types of data, for example its move to block access to the DoubleClick ID and its proposal to block third-party cookies on Chrome.</p>

<p>The ACCC’s preliminary report sets out a series of possible options for addressing the issues in the ad tech industry, based on suggestions received during this inquiry and other industry developments.</p>

<p>Feedback is sought on these options, which include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rules to manage conflicts of interest and prevent self-preferencing in the supply of ad tech services. The ACCC notes that the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK and the European Commission have both recently released proposals that relate to these issues, and seeks feedback on which aspects of those proposals could be appropriate in Australia.</li>
	<li>Proposals to enhance the ability of ad tech providers to assess the price and quality of services, including requiring demand-side platforms to allow independent verification and that the industry implement common transaction and user IDs.</li>
	<li>Promoting competition in the industry through boosting data portability (allowing a consumer’s data to be moved or shared at their request) and interoperability (allowing data to be shared between firms without a request from a consumer). One option is to require firms with a significant data advantage to provide consumers with an easy way to port their data between rival.</li>
	<li>Mandating the breaking up of datasets held by large incumbents, to make it easier for rival ad tech providers to enter and compete in the supply of ad tech services.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ACCC recognises that any proposals must be carefully designed with an eye to regulatory burden, efficiency and protecting consumers’ privacy while enhancing competition and transparency.</p>

<p>The report also supports the ACCC’s previous recommendations from the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-finalised/digital-platforms-inquiry-0">Digital platforms inquiry</a> to introduce an unfair practices provision and the establishment of an ombudsman scheme to resolve complaints and disputes with digital platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report is available at <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-advertising-services-inquiry">Digital advertising services inquiry</a>. Submissions to the preliminary report are due by 26 February 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p>

<p>Digital display advertisements are the images or videos that appear before or alongside content viewed online. This inquiry considers the advertising technology or “ad tech” services that deliver personalised digital display advertising and associated advertising agency services.</p>

<p>Examples of situations where individuals may view targeted display advertising include</p>

<ul>
	<li>Image or video ads shown while viewing a website in a browser on a desktop or mobile device</li>
	<li>Image or video advertising integrated into the content of a mobile app</li>
	<li>Videos shown during the ‘ad breaks’ in the ‘catch-up’ video streaming services of major commercial television networks</li>
</ul>

<p>The inquiry has examined four key ad tech services: advertiser ad servers, demand side platforms, supply-side platforms and publisher ad servers.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>On 10 February 2020, the Treasurer signed a Ministerial Direction requiring the ACCC to hold a public inquiry into markets for the supply of ad tech services and ad agency services.</p>

<p>This inquiry is being conducted by the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Branch, and will build on the findings of the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry, which delivered its final report in July 2019.</p>

<p>The ACCC provided a preliminary report to the Treasurer on 31 December 2020 and will provide a final report by 31 August 2021.</p>

<p>The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Branch is also conducting a separate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platform-services-inquiry-2020-2025">Inquiry</a>&nbsp;into markets for the supply of digital platform services. The first interim report for that inquiry was publicly released in October 2020.</p>

<p>The ACCC is closely following recent overseas enforcement actions in relation to Google’s supply of ad tech services, including the complaint filed by the Texas Attorney-General on behalf of nine US states on 16 December 2020 alleging that Google has monopoly power and forecloses competition in the markets for publisher ad server for display inventory, display ad exchanges, display ad networks and separate markets for display ad buying tools for large and small advertisers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>Among the millions of images available on Wikimedia Commons is a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AsterNovi-belgii-flower-1mb.jpg">stunning photo</a> of a purple daisy with a yellow pistil. Taken in The Hague in 2004, it appears to be a variety of aster, a genus of flowering plants that mostly grow in Eurasia. It’s a nice picture, but its beauty doesn’t explain why the photo has received around 78 million hits each day — mostly from India — since roughly June 29 of last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Albon, the director of machine learning at the Wikimedia Foundation (the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons), <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon/status/1358890731981611009">said</a> in a tweet Monday that the flower was accounting for 20% of data requests for media to one of the organization’s servers. Albon called the spike in traffic “an ongoing mystery,” and linked to a <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T273741">ticket</a> on the Wikimedia forum where people were discussing what might be causing it. The flower photo soon began attracting attention on other parts of the internet, including <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26072025">Hacker News</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The original ticket on the Wikimedia forum indicated that the traffic was likely coming from a mobile app, a clue that helped guide early theories. One person identified a health conglomerate in India that has “Aster” in its name and speculated that its app or website might be using the photo and unintentionally sending traffic back to Wikimedia. Others remembered the generic image of the flower referenced as an example in their coding or design classes, leading them to wonder whether a particularly popular online course could be the culprit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Photos uploaded to Wikimedia Commons can be used by anyone for free and are often included as part of Wikipedia articles. Photographers from around the world have contributed to the project, including a Dutch man named Teun Spaans, who appears to be responsible for the picture of the purple flower. Spaans could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>



<p>Many online commenters noted that the purple flower had been used in sample code on sites like Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer forum for programmers. They theorized that an app developer may have accidentally copied and pasted one of the samples and forgot to remove a link to the photograph. Using code snippets from Stack Overflow is a common strategy among developers around the world.</p>



<p>“It appears to be a classic case of hot linking,” said Michael Donohoe, head of product at <em>Rest of World</em>. Hot linking is when a website displays an image by linking to the original site where it’s hosted, instead of uploading it separately. The practice allows the site borrowing the picture to avoid using their own server space — that’s why Wikimedia is forced to handle the requests to the flower photo. “As I’m sure you’ve gathered, people often do it by mistake [copy/paste code without knowing what it does]. When done by a developer, it’s usually sloppy coding and doesn’t look good,” Donohoe explained.</p>



<p>As speculators began trying to identify which app might be behind the traffic, another clue emerged: June 29, the day the flower photo first began attracting a significant amount of traffic, is the same day the Indian government blocked a group of apps made by Chinese developers, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/do-you-even-tiktok-tiktok/">including the social media platform TikTok</a>. Millions of Indians began flocking to the app’s <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-clock-is-tik-tok-tik-tok/">domestic competitors</a>, including MX TakaTak, Moj, and Josh. The evidence suggested that one of the TikTok replacements had inadvertently hot-linked to the flower image in their code. Then, after TikTok was banned and the copycat app suddenly became popular, traffic to the picture began spiking.</p>



<p>Public <a href="https://pageviews.toolforge.org/mediaviews/?project=commons.wikimedia.org&amp;platform=&amp;agent=spider&amp;referer=all-referers&amp;start=2020-06-29&amp;end=2021-02-08&amp;files=AsterNovi-belgii-flower-1mb.jpg">data</a> collected by the Wikimedia Foundation indicates that the image has been receiving roughly the same amount of traffic since June 29, about 78 million hits per day. That suggests an app with tens of millions of daily active users is likely responsible. Traffic for the purple flower first began spiking around June 15, when it received roughly 5 million hits. That number quickly jumped after TikTok was banned in India and peaked at almost 120 million hits on New Year’s Eve. (Before June, the picture was getting only a few hundred hits a day.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, the culprit remains a mystery — at least to the public. Sukhbir Singh, an engineer at the Wikimedia Foundation, said on the nonprofit’s forum that, after extensive testing, it had identified the app in question and confirmed it was from India. He said the organization planned to release the name of it soon. “We have initiated contact with the app developers and are waiting to hear back from them. In the meantime, given the volume of requests, we have decided to ban those specific requests until the issue is resolved,” Singh wrote. The Wikimedia Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>



<p>Singh added that Wikimedia couldn’t find the image anywhere in the app itself, “confirming our theory that it fetches the image but does not display it.” In other words, every day, millions of phones are sending traffic to a beautiful photograph of a flower, but no one is able to actually witness its beauty. It’s like a weird version of the butterfly effect — except for throwaway code.</p>

<p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> Want to reread The Lord of the Rings? Or are you more a fan of Harry Potter? Use MeiliSearch to find your favorite books quickly!</p><p>This tutorial uses a sample dataset from GoodReads uploaded by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks" rel="nofollow">Jealous Leopard on Kaggle</a>.</p><p>The goal of this tutorial is to learn more about advanced MeiliSearch concepts, such as:</p><ul><li>How MeiliSearch handles nested objects</li><li>How to use facets to calculate the distribution of documents</li><li>How to use distinct attributes</li><li>How to define searchable attributes using the settings object</li></ul><p>So, what are the requirements to follow this tutorial?</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>To follow this standalone tutorial, we expect you to have a basic understanding of MeiliSearch. If you’re unsure, feel free to check out the previous tutorial about <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/how-to-search-nobel-prize-winners-faster-with-meilisearch-api-for-javascript/" rel="nofollow">searching for Nobel prize winners</a>—however, it isn’t required.</p><p>Other requirements include.</p><ul><li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="nofollow">A Node.js installation</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch#getting-started">A MeiliSearch instance</a>: this can be running locally, via Docker, or on a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/meilisearch?action=deploy">DigitalOcean droplet</a>. Don’t want to set up your own MeiliSearch instance? Try out our <a href="https://sandbox.meilisearch.com/" rel="nofollow">MeiliSearch sandbox</a> to create a free, remote-hosted instance available for 72h.</li><li><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html" rel="nofollow">cURL</a> or Postman for sending requests from the terminal</li><li>The MeiliSearch-js wrapper and dependencies (see the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js#-installation">installation guide</a>).</li></ul><p>All set? Let's dive right into it!</p><h2 id="project-setup-and-meilisearch-js-installation">Project setup and MeiliSearch-js installation</h2><p>To follow along, we need to set up our JavaScript project and install MeiliSearch-js. Create a new folder and run the following command in your terminal.</p><p><code>npm init -y</code></p><p>This will prepare your project setup. Next, we can add the MeiliSearch-js dependency.</p><p><code>npm install meilisearch</code></p><p>Lastly, let’s create a file called <code>index.js</code> inside your project. We’ll use this file to add our JavaScript code.</p><p><code>touch index.js</code></p><p>Done? Let's move on!</p><h2 id="step-1-creating-an-index">Step 1: Creating an index</h2><p>This step will prepare the <code>index.js</code> file so we can experiment with the <code>meilisearch</code> package.</p><p>First, we need to connect with our MeiliSearch instance. If you've used the MeiliSearch sandbox, you've received a <strong>master key that protects all API endpoints for your MeiliSearch instance</strong>. If you've used another installation method, we highly recommend <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/guides/advanced_guides/authentication.html#authentication" rel="nofollow">setting a master key</a> for security reasons. For instance, an unsecured DigitalOcean droplet allows anyone to access your instance via the publicly available IP address.</p><p>Below, you’ll find a boilerplate code snippet that you can reuse in all of your MeiliSearch projects. We wrap our code in an asynchronous <code>main</code> function in order to access the <code>async/await</code> syntax. We also use the <code>client</code> object to connect with our MeiliSearch instance.</p><p>Add the code snippet below to your <code>index.js</code> file.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')

const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
    const indexes = await client.listIndexes()
    console.log(indexes)
}

main()</code></pre><p>Note that we call the <code>listIndexes()</code> method on the newly created <code>client</code> object. If you are using a new instance, your terminal should print an empty array. For users who've opted for the MeiliSearch sandbox, it comes with a <code>movies</code> index by default.</p><p>Now, execute the file from your terminal with the <code>node</code> command.</p><p><code>node index.js</code></p><p>If you've received a response from your client, the connection object works. If you haven’t, double check your host address and API key.</p><p>For the next step, let's create the <code>books</code> index to add our GoodReads data.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const indexes = await client.listIndexes()
    console.log(indexes)
 
    await client.createIndex('books')
 
    const updatedIndexes = await client.listIndexes()
    console.log(updatedIndexes)
}
 
main()</code></pre><p>Execute the file with the <code>node</code> command like before. You should see the following response containing your <code>books</code> index. Note that your values for <code>createdAt</code> and <code>updatedAt</code> will be different from ours.</p><pre><code>[ 
  { 
    name: 'books',
    uid: 'books',
    createdAt: '2020-12-15T11:34:23.052004747Z',
    updatedAt: '2020-12-15T11:34:23.052024846Z',
    primaryKey: null 
  }
]
</code></pre><p>Our index is created, but we haven’t given it a primary key yet. When we add data in the next step, MeiliSearch will <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/documents.html#primary-field">infer our primary key</a> because our data set contains an <code>id</code> field.</p><p>Index created? Good! Let’s explore the GoodReads books data set.</p><h2 id="step-2-adding-the-goodreads-books-dataset">Step 2: Adding the GoodReads books dataset</h2><p>This step explores the GoodReads books dataset. For clarity, we’ve used a modified, smaller version of this dataset, but you can find the original dataset on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>, if you’re interested. First, let's download our dataset using the cURL command.</p><pre><code>curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/michielmulders/671ba6e225fbb815bd3f610f5b006802/raw/33c410c003239d2fbda0ebd535e9f94176544f8c/books.json -o books.json</code></pre><p>So, what does a <code>book</code> object look like?</p><pre><code>{
    id: "1",
    title: "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince",
    author: "J.K. Rowling/Mary GrandPré",
    cover: "hard cover with dust jacket",
    language: "eng",
    publisher: "Scholastic Inc.",
    details: {
        isbn: "0439785960",
        rating: "4.57",
        pages: "652"
    }
}</code></pre><p>Each book contains a unique <code>id</code>. The <code>cover</code> property has three possible values: <code>hard cover</code>, <code>hard cover with dust jacket</code>, and <code>soft cover</code>. This property will be useful later on when we take a look at distinct attributes.</p><p>To display how MeiliSearch handles nested objects, we've created a <code>details</code> property that contains the book's <code>isbn</code> code, <code>rating</code>, and number of <code>pages</code>.</p><p>Note that the dataset contains a <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/under_the_hood/datatypes.html#object">nested JSON object</a>. JSON objects are broken into separate string tokens during indexing, which means separate words. This means that each value gets tokenized and indexed so the value is searchable.</p><p>Ok, let's add the data to our <code>books</code> index. For this, we'll be using the <code>curl</code> command again. Make sure you execute the command in the folder that contains the <code>books.json</code> file.</p><pre><code>curl -i -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/books/documents' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Meili-API-Key: your-master-key' \
  --data @books.json</code></pre><p>If the query returns a status 201, the documents have been created successfully!</p><p>Alternatively, you can use JavaScript code to upload documents to your index. Here's an example.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
const books = require('./books.json')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const index = client.index('books')
    index.addDocuments(books).then((res) =&gt; console.log(res))

    console.info('Documents added!')
}
 
main()</code></pre><p>Now, if you open a browser and navigate to the host address of your MeiliSearch instance (by default: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7700/">http://127.0.0.1:7700</a>), you can use our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/web_interface.html#web-interface">web interface</a> to start searching with the index you just created. </p><p>That's it for adding documents! </p><h2 id="step-3-using-facets-to-calculate-the-distribution-of-documents">Step 3: Using facets to calculate the distribution of documents</h2><p>To improve our search, we can use facet filters. They index data for a particular property so the MeiliSearch instance can retrieve data faster. Furthermore, faceting allows users to browse data by category and narrow their search selection, which leads to faster searching.</p><p>To retrieve the facet distribution, we have to define a <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/settings.html#attributes-for-faceting">facet filter</a>. For this example, we want to figure out the language distribution of all books written by <code>Douglas Adams</code>. Therefore, let's define a facet filter for the <code>language</code> property. Our dataset contains five different languages. That's perfect for faceting.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const index = client.index('books')
    
    await index.updateSettings({
        attributesForFaceting:
        [
            "language"
        ]
    })
}

main()</code></pre><p>Let's say we want to figure out the language distribution of all books written by author <code>Douglas Adams</code>. In other words, we want to know how many books are written in <code>eng</code> (English), <code>esp</code> (Spanish), or <code>fre</code> (French).</p><p>You can try for yourself how to solve this problem. Information and examples about the facets distribution can be found in the <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/faceted_search.html#using-facets">documentation</a> (scroll down to "The facets distribution"). You can also find <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js#-api-resources">a list of MeiliSearch-js functions</a> on the repository README.</p><p>We expect the following outcome for <code>Douglas Adams</code>.</p><pre><code>{ 
    hits:[ ... ],
    offset: 0,
    limit: 20,
    nbHits: 10,
    query: 'Douglas Adams',
    facetsDistribution: { 
        language: 
        { 
            mul: 0, 
            esp: 1, 
            eng: 9, 
            spa: 0, 
            fre: 0 
        }
    },
   exhaustiveFacetsCount: true 
}
</code></pre><p><br><strong>Code solution for facets distribution</strong></p><p>Solution: To obtain the facet distribution, we can pass the `facetsDistribution` property with our search query.</p><pre><code>const { MeiliSearch } = require('meilisearch')
 
const main = async () =&gt; {
    const client = new MeiliSearch({
        host: 'http://127.0.0.1:7700',
        headers: {
            'X-Meili-API-Key': 'your-master-key'
        }
    })
 
    const index = client.index('books')
    
    const distribution = await index
        .search('Douglas Adams', {
            facetsDistribution: ['language']
        })
    console.log(distribution)
}

main()</code></pre><p>Cool, right? Let's move on!</p><h2 id="step-4-using-distinct-attributes-to-avoid-duplicates">Step 4: Using distinct attributes to avoid duplicates</h2><p>Perform a search for <code>The Lord of the Rings 2</code>. Notice anything strange?</p><pre><code>{

February 9, 2021 | https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>A <b>brainwallet</b> refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one's own mind by memorizing a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase" title="Seed phrase">seed phrase</a>. If the seed is not recorded anywhere, the Bitcoins can be thought of as being held only in the mind of the owner. If a brainwallet is forgotten or the person dies or is permanently incapacitated, the Bitcoins are lost forever. Using memory techniques allow them to be memorized and recalled easily.
</p><p>To create a brainwallet, use Bitcoin wallet software to generate a seed phrase and then memorize it. Such seeds are generated by wallets like <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Electrum" title="Electrum">Electrum</a>, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Armory" title="Armory">Armory</a> and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mycelium" title="Mycelium">Mycelium</a>.
</p><p>Brainwallets are not recommended to be used in general because of fallible human memory. But in special situations they could be very useful, for example when fleeing a country as a refugee with only the clothes on your back.
</p>

<h2><span id="Worked_Example">Worked Example</span></h2>
<ol><li> Run <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Electrum" title="Electrum">Electrum</a> and use it to generate a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase" title="Seed phrase">seed phrase</a>.</li>
<li> Memorize the phrase using <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system</a></li>
<li> When spending or saving, restore the wallet from memory using the phrase.</li></ol>
<h3><span id="Example_Mnemonic_Peg">Example Mnemonic Peg</span></h3>
<p>To memorize a seed with this method you must invent a story which hits the words as "keynotes". Try to make it like a fairy tale story, use imagery. Make it somehow striking and emotionally resonant. When remembering you just remember the key words, not all the other words - the other can be remembered more as images and thoughts (which are hard to write down)
</p><p>Let's say we have this seed:
</p>
<pre>   witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least
</pre>
<p>You'd imagine walking through a building familiar to you, maybe your own home or workplace or school.
</p>
<ul><li> You imagine looking in the first room and seeing your mother dressed as a <b>witch</b>, playing the jenga boardgame until the tower <b>collapses</b>.</li>
<li> You walk to the next room and see your father <b>practising</b> with a longbow, he shoots a chicken to <b>feeds</b> himself.</li>
<li> In the next room you see your brother naked in <b>shame</b> attempting to cover himself, he's looking through a window that's <b>open</b> and flapping in the wind.</li>
<li> Now you reach the kitchen, girlfriend is looking at Picasso's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_%28Picasso%29">Guernica</a> on the wall. She is in <b>despair</b> from it. Next to it is a television playing the show Dawson's <b>Creek</b>.</li>
<li> Next you're in the garage, your childhood friend is working on his car. He plans to go on a <b>road</b> trip for the 5th time this month, he's going <b>again</b>.</li>
<li> Finally to go outside to the garden. It's early spring and the ground is covered in melting <b>ice</b>. Two of your other friends are there, one friend has a huge basket of apples, the other has a smaller basket but you're holding only some apples. You've got the <b>least</b> apples.</li></ul>
<p>Repeat this story in your head several times over a short period - the first few days. It will sink in, deep, after that. You'll only have to revisit it very occasionally. After a while you can ignore it for months and it'll still come back, not that I'd recommend relying on that.
</p>
<h3><span id="Video_Example_of_Mnemonic_Peg_Method">Video Example of Mnemonic Peg Method</span></h3>
<p>From the BBC documentary The Human Mind (2003) by Professor Robert Winston. Approximately 31 minutes in. Memorizing a list of 30 random words.
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhfQCW1f68&amp;t=1867">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhfQCW1f68&amp;t=1867</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Fallible_Memory_Warning">Fallible Memory Warning</span></h3>
<p>Despite the memory aids, human memory can be very fallible. So if your only storage is memory you may find that it just vanished one day.
</p><p>Data should always be backed up. Storing a seed phrase in one place is bad, even if that one place is your brain.
</p>
<h2><span id="Obsolete_Brainwallet_Style">Obsolete Brainwallet Style</span></h2>
<p>An early old-style brainwallet was created by by memorization of a passphrase and converting it a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key" title="Private key">private key</a> with a hashing or key derivation algorithm (example: SHA256). That private key is then used to compute a Bitcoin address. This method was found to be very insecure and <b>should not be used</b>. Humans are not a good source of entropy. Using a single address also has problems associated with <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse" title="Address reuse">address reuse</a>.
</p>
<h3><span id="Low_Entropy_from_Human-Generated_Passphrases">Low Entropy from Human-Generated Passphrases</span></h3>
<p>Practically everyone who knows about or cares loudly yells at people DO NOT USE BRAINWALLETS [GENERATED BY HUMANS]. We've seen pretty concrete evidence that users are resistant to good advice in this space, and they are shocked when their favorite quotation is cracked and they lose their coins (But it was 60 characters long! I even added a special character! how is this possible?!), the existing sites promoting this stuff won't use a KDF stronger than SHA256*1 because "users are stupid if they use weak passwords". <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span id="Ryan_Castellucci_DEFCON_Talk">Ryan Castellucci DEFCON Talk</span></h3>
<p>Ryan Castellucci gave a talk at DEFCON23 about cracking brainwallet passphrases. Although brainwallet passphrases were being exploited for years by this point, the talk helped bring the issues to more popular consciousness.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span id="Legacy_Code">Legacy Code</span></h3>
<p>If you have coins in an old-style brainwallet, the website <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bitaddress.org/">http://www.bitaddress.org/</a> contains a GUI for generating the private key using the sha256(passphrase) algorithm. It's highly recommended you move the coins out as soon as you can.

You can also check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/11/haskell-bad-parts-2">part 2</a>. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<p>Note that this is the last blog post in this series where I had specific ideas queued up. So it's likely that this will be the last post for a while until I get annoyed by something again. So if you really want to see a continuation, find some bit of Haskell code that will annoy me and share it with me!</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2>
<p>OK, this section title is a complete troll. I don't think pattern matching is a bad part of Haskell. I think pattern matching is one of the most powerful features in all of Haskell, especially when combined with sum types/ADTs. If someone asked me for a singular reason to consider using Haskell, this is what I'd point to.</p>
<p>Which is why the bad parts of pattern matching in Haskell are so bad. My "Haskell elevator pitch" is almost immediately undermined by terrible defaults.</p>
<p>My elevator pitch goes something like this: with sum types, you get to define your data types far more explicitly than in languages with only product types. And then you can rely on the compiler to tell you when you've made a change to a data constructor, or added a new data constructor. I usually try to understand first what someone's field of experience is and then build a real-ish example of sum types from that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's all a lie, at least by default. Some specific parts of pattern matching <em>do</em> in fact let the compiler tell you when you've screwed up. (And if it's not clear: my favorite part of GHC is when it tells me I've screwed up.) If I delete a data constructor, or if I add a new field to a data constructor and I was pattern matching on positionally, the compiler will error.</p>
<p>But this code compiles just fine, and I wish it didn't!</p>
<pre><code><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=
    case </span><span>Baz </span><span>of
        </span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"
        </span><span>Bar </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Bar</span><span>"

</span></code></pre>
<p>Not only does it compile just fine, but <em>there are no warnings</em>! "OK Michael," you say. "Who cares? <em>Everyone</em> knows that you should compile with <code>-Wall</code> turned on." To that, I say three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>No, not everyone knows it</li>
<li>Because of spurious warnings in <code>-Wall</code>, like unused import warnings, important warnings like this often get drowned out. (Yes, it's better to be warning-free for this reason...)</li>
<li>Yeah, but it gets worse</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's elaborate on (3). I'm a good programmer. So I turn on <code>-Wall</code>. Now I'm guaranteed a warning on incomplete pattern matches... right? Right?!? Right!!!!!!1111oneoneone</p>
<pre><code><span>{-# </span><span>OPTIONS_GHC</span><span> -Wall #-}
</span><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>\</span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"</span><span>) </span><span>Bar
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nope, denied! I get no warning here. Even though I have a <em>refutable pattern match</em> in my lambda, the compiler provides no warnings. "Didn't you know you needed to turn on <code>incomplete-uni-patterns</code> for that?" Actually, no, for a long time I didn't know that.</p>
<pre><code><span>{-# </span><span>OPTIONS_GHC</span><span> -Wall -Wincomplete-uni-patterns #-}
</span><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>\</span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"</span><span>) </span><span>Bar
</span></code></pre>
<p>Fortunately, there's some <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15656">hope on the horizon</a> for this one.</p>
<p>One more annoyance, only tangentially related. GHC: please stop generating partial functions on my behalf!</p>
<pre><code><span>data </span><span>Staff
    </span><span>= </span><span>Principal
    </span><span>| </span><span>Teacher</span><span> { subject </span><span>:: </span><span>String</span><span> }

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>$ </span><span>"</span><span>Your subject is </span><span>" </span><span>++</span><span> subject </span><span>Principal
</span></code></pre>
<p>I just discovered that this can be detected with <code>-Wpartial-fields</code>, which is nice, but not part of <code>-Wall</code>. I've been giving advice for a long time to not include any field labels in sum types, and I'll continue to give that advice.</p>
<p>Note that some Haskellers won't like: this topic came up for me recently while writing a blog post comparing pattern matching in Haskell and Rust (probably going live next week). And, yet again, Rust does this better than Haskell. Yes, Rust is strict and Haskell is lazy. But as far as I'm concerned, in this case, Rust is simply more type safe than Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="slow-compilation">Slow compilation</h2>
<p>Let's get an elephant in the room out in the open. Compiling is slow. Some of this is because of GHC. Some of this is because our libraries are trying to do overly complicated things (like stream fusion in <code>vector</code> and <code>text</code>). This is a bane for Haskell, constantly.</p>
<p>As a recent example, I needed to add a flag to <code>http-conduit</code> to disable the <code>aeson</code> dependency:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@snoyberg</a> kindly provided "-aeson" flag to http-conduit which saves my time very much. Thanks.<br>BTW, why does building aeson take so much time?</p>— 山本和彦 (@kazu_yamamoto) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazu_yamamoto/status/1334988010434150401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>I'm not going to beat up on this too much, since GHC is a complicated project and people are trying hard to both improve the existing support <em>and</em> add new features. And library authors (myself included) are caught between providing features and speeding up compilation.</p>
<p>There is a part of me that wonders if part of the problem is that our standard library (<code>base</code>) doesn't provide enough functionality out of the box, and leaves a lot of external libraries to implement and reimplement similar functionality. As more time goes on, I think Vincent Hanquez was <a href="https://github.com/haskell-foundation">completely correct about how to improve Haskell</a> and I wish I'd embraced it.</p>
<h2 id="text">Text</h2>
<p>There's so much wrong here. And I can't even blame it all on the <code>text</code> package. But I can blame a lot of it on the <code>text</code> package. Consider this section incoherent rambling instead of well reasoned arguments. (Typically a fair assumption with anything I say to be honest.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Why oh why is it UTF-16 instead of UTF-8? This is terrible! Except...</li>
<li>It's completely irrelevant what encoding <code>text</code> uses under the surface, because <em>you can't directly interact with its underlying representation</em>. And <em>that's</em> because...</li>
<li><code>text</code> uses unpinned memory to avoid heap fragmentation, which is a Good Thing, but then <code>text</code> can't be directly used in FFI calls. Which is probably a good thing, since it uses the wrong character encoding under the surface.</li>
<li><code>text</code> defines its own <code>Builder</code> type. It shouldn't. We should be using the <code>ByteString</code> <code>Builder</code> everywhere, and have a <code>newtype</code> wrapper around it to encode the invariant "must be UTF-8 encoded." <code>Builder</code> is a <em>wonderful</em> thing in Haskell, and it gets used far less than it should because it's such a PITA to deal with all of this. (I tried to address that in <code>rio</code>.) This is exactly the same as how we don't use <code>Vector</code> enough because of all the flaws with using it.</li>
<li>And, of course, <code>text</code> has stream fusion, which is shouldn't. I'll touch on this even more in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Vincent got this all right. We need a singular packed data type. It should underly a <code>ByteString</code> and a <code>Text</code>. A <code>Text</code> should be a simple newtype around a <code>ByteString</code>. Users should never have to make a decision around pinned vs unpinned memory, that should be an implementation detail. (And sure, why not, give users a knob somewhere to control this when they know better than the defaults.) Have a single <code>Builder</code> type that builds up <code>Vector</code>s, and have it work for <code>ByteString</code> and <code>Text</code> too.</p>
<p>Oh, and just a side note...</p>
<p><strong>MAKE TEXT UBIQUITOUS</strong></p>
<p>We are now more than 10 years since the first release of <code>text</code> to Hackage. And people are still regularly using <code>String</code>. <strong>I</strong> regularly use <code>String</code> in examples. We really should be able to move our ecosystem over to better types.</p>
<p>We've broken everyone's code for far less important things many times in the past. Just to rile you all up: Foldable/Traversable Proposal wasn't important or interesting, this should have taken precedence.</p>
<h2 id="lazy-data-structures">Lazy data structures</h2>
<p>There should be no lazy <code>ByteString</code>. There should be no lazy <code>Text</code>. There isn't a lazy <code>Vector</code>, and that's a Good Thing.</p>
<p>"But what if I want to read a 10GB file into memory lazily?" You're using the wrong abstraction.</p>
<p>"But what if I want to lazily generate a massive file?" You're using the wrong abstraction.</p>
<p>Here's the problem: we don't have the right abstraction in <code>base</code>. We ended up at a local minimum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lazy lists get used for "generators" and for data storage, when they're only half good for the former</li>
<li>We don't get a real generator type in <code>base</code>, because we have lazy lists</li>
<li>We don't get a real data storage type in <code>base</code>, because <code>vector</code> exists and sucks</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of lazy lists from the language entirely</li>
<li>Add a streaming data interface to <code>base</code> that properly handles side-effects without hacks like lazy I/O</li>
<li>Provide great tooling around that streaming data interface, like stream fusion</li>
<li>Add a <code>Vector</code>-like type to <code>base</code> that only handles storage, no fusion or generation, and have it work with the streaming data interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I'll say: Vincent got it right.</p>
<h2 id="qualified-imports">Qualified imports</h2>
<p>Since everyone loves to fixate on trivial syntactic issues, let me include one of those here at the end so everyone can ignore my other points. Qualified imports suck. Actually, modules suck. Actually, modules and packages suck. Actually, it all sucks.</p>
<p>The first problem? Our names are too verbose. <code>import qualified Control.Monad.Trans.Class as Trans</code>. I've actually typed that, many times. That's too much typing. Why is it <code>Control.Monad</code>? How does it help me?</p>
<p>What package does that module live in? You can't tell from the name. It's <code>transformers</code>. I think. Oh wait, no, now it's in <code>base</code>. My bad. Anyway, packages are able to just trample all over each others' namespaces like this. It's annoying.</p>
<p>And because Haskell doesn't have object syntax, importing identifiers directly, or qualified importing modules, is an absolute must for accessing most functionality on types. OOP kinda beat us here.</p>
<p>Yay, more incoherent rambling!</p>
<h2 id="should-we-fix-this">Should we fix this?</h2>
<p>OK, serious talk here. I think the warnings issue I mentioned above should absolutely be fixed. For the last section: I don't see a reality where a holistic change to Haskell syntax, module hierarchy, etc, could ever be possible. We're stuck with what we've got, possibly with minor ergonomic …</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>Wanna know how you can prioritise technical debt and reduce it? There are no <em>three easy steps</em> solutions to do so. It’s more complicated and messier than that. You need to translate technical debt into business impact. By framing technical debt as cost we have an easily understandable metric we can use to rally for support. After all, if technical debt does not hurt the business in any way, why should anyone care?</p>



<h2>Technical debt hurts the bottom line</h2>



<p>Don’t fall into the trap of measuring technical debt only in technical terms. Calculating your maintainability index certainly has its merit. But it won’t put your technical debt on anyone’s roadmap. If you tell a product manager how insanely high your cyclomatic complexity is the only reasonable answer is: <em>So what?</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-1024x684.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt-768x513.jpg 768w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prioritise-technical-debt.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>What you really want to show is how bad your technical debt is for your business. That means you want to frame your technical debt as a monetary value. Start measuring the impact on developer productivity, cost of interrupted service or estimating impact of black swan events like security breaches. Here is a more extensive article about <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/tech/how-to-measure-technical-debt/">how you can measure technical debt</a>.</p>



<h3>Technical debt is not technical</h3>



<p>Stop looking at technical debt in isolation. A fundamental problem of not erasing technical debt is that it has to compete against feature requests. Such feature requests often have a clear business case and are much more predictable. They pay into your shiny new company strategy directly and look good on your CV. Yes, the cards are stacked against you.</p>



<p>Add to this the uncertainty and high risk for any individual or team tackling the technical debt and to understand why it is so hard to prioritise technical debt. Especially global technical debt comes with another layer of difficulty. Such debt is not owned by a single team and it does not affect a single feature. How technical debt comes to be and grow is a good example of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tragedy-of-the-commons.asp">tragedy of the commons</a>. So let’s find a way to counteract all those problems.</p>



<h2>A continuous budget for technical debt</h2>



<p>Let’s just be adults about it. We’ve seen that technical debt slows your team down. Instead of fighting a constant prioritisation battle we can simply set aside a certain amount of time for working on our technical debt, we’ll call this the 80/20 approach. 20% of your team’s effort is consistently spent on technical debt.</p>



<p>This approach brings with it a few advantages:</p>



<ul><li>You can continuously work on technical debt</li><li>The prioritisation process stays simple. You can prioritise technical debt and product features separately.</li></ul>



<p>But unfortunately it falls short in some aspects as well:</p>



<ul><li>If you only have a day in a week to work on technical debt, you will focus on small tasks leaving the bigger, more severe issues aside.</li><li>You’re multi-tasking which means both the feature work and technical debt take longer to get done. Besides that you’re wasting time switching context.</li><li>We focus on how much time we spend on technical debt, not on the impact and outcomes of our efforts</li><li>When the pressure is on to meet deadlines the 20% of your technical debt time is hard to defend and justify. What starts as a one-off exception can quickly turn into a 90/10 and eventually a 100/0 split.</li></ul>



<h2>RICE is not just for cooking</h2>



<p>Let’s see if we can do better than assigning a continuous budget for technical debt. With the RICE prioritisation technique we can try to frame our technical debt as business opportunity.</p>



<p>You assess the <strong>Reach</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong> of your opportunities, add your level of <strong>confidence</strong> and the expected <strong>effort</strong>. With those four variables you can then calculate a number for each opportunity, your RICE score. The higher the more valuable the opportunity.</p>



<h3>Prioritising features and technical debt with RICE</h3>



<p>Let’s try to compare a feature against technical debt with RICE. The feature we want to build is a new API endpoint. The technical debt we want to repay is replacing our API gateway. </p>



<p>The new API endpoint can reach about 50.000 of our customers and the endpoint has a medium impact (you can use any scale, for example 1 – 5) on their business, it’s a “nice to have”, so we’ll score it with a 2. We’re relatively confident (80%) that our numbers are accurate because we did the customer research and analysed feature requests. It’d take one team roughly 3 weeks from concept to production. </p>



<p>Now we calculate <em>Reach * Impact * Confidence / Effort</em> which comes out at the random number of 32.000. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Over_9000!">It’s over 9.000</a> which is good I guess. Let’s do the same for our technical debt.</p>



<p>The API gateway on the other hand is a central piece of our architecture, affecting every single customer. Let’s say that number is 350.000. The impact on each one of them is arguably smaller, because there would only be the performance improvement here and there and one of the other fixed edge case. So we’ll score it with a 1. It’s technical debt so we can’t be sure that the new gateway will deliver on all its promises. So we’ll only give it a 60% confidence score. Unfortunately it’s also not the simplest so you need two teams for roughly 4 weeks, 8 weeks in total. Let’s do the math: 350.000 * 1 * 0.6 / 6 equals 26.250. That proves how our technical debt is not as valuable as our shiny new endpoint. But does it really?</p>



<h3>Leave the RICE for the kitchen, not the codebase</h3>



<p>RICE is great for giving you a framework to look at certain data points and making rational decisions. However, in this case it has a few shortcomings:</p>



<ul><li>It’s customer centric. We’ve assumed that technical debt will provide customer value and that this is the only important dimension. But maybe the biggest value in fixing technical debt lies in gained efficiency and reduced cost through developer productivity. Unfortunately there’s no easy way to measure those different forms of value against each other. Back to square one.</li><li>While you can define the reach and impact with reasonable effort your confidence and efforts are really just opinionated estimations. And <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/make-better-predictions-stop-estimating/">your estimates tend to be pretty bad</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Okay, so far we have discovered to ways of how we can <strong>not</strong> prioritise technical debt. Let’s give it one more try.</p>



<h2>Show me the money</h2>



<p>Let’s try expressing our technical debt in terms which really matter to the business: money. Let’s try to answer how much technical debt costs us.</p>



<p>Technical debt is often not directly tied to a single feature. The most painful technical debt is systemic, affecting development across the organisation. It makes every feature touching it slower and more expensive. This costs us in three different ways: Developer productivity, delayed feature releases and infrastructure cost.</p>



<h3>Measuring developer productivity</h3>



<p>The simplest way to measure the impact on developer productivity is marking every interaction with the technical debt. Over a longer timeframe you can then do a simple statistical analysis. How long does a feature or pull request take on average? How much slower from first commit to production is your feature when it has to interact with the technical debt? </p>



<p>While this is only showing correlation and not causation, it still gives us some comprehensible data. Let’s say that the average developer works 20 hours for an average pull request. Features touching the technical debt take 30% longer, so about 6 hours. In a month your whole organisation creates 15 of such pull requests. Your average engineer costs you $70 per hour. <em>6 hours * 15 pull requests * $70 * 12 months</em> makes over $75.000. That’s almost a full engineering year just spent on this. But consider that this is only one single piece of technical debt. Also, it’s only one piece of the puzzle.</p>



<h3>Fixing technical debt boosts efficiency</h3>



<p>The even bigger implication is that every feature takes 30% longer to build. That doesn’t just cost you in terms of engineering salary. It costs you time that your feature could already earn you money. In product management this is called <em>cost of delay</em>. A product doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It has a lifecycle. While you’re still building your competitors are snatching up your customers. Here you can <a href="https://www.playbookhq.co/blog/cost-of-delay-calculate">read more about the cost of delay</a> but for now we just focus on the numbers. Because of the technical debt and the product-lifecycle we can not generate as much revenue from the new features we ship.</p>



<p>Let’s say on average a feature helps our sales team to onboard 20 new customers, netting us $500 each per month, $10.000 in total per feature. If your feature is one month late you lose $10.000 in profits. Let’s say we ship 3 features each month, one of them a month delayed because of technical debt. That’s $10.000 revenue lost each month, or $120.000 a year.</p>



<p>If you add up the lost developer productivity and the cost of delay we can estimate our technical debt costs us almost $200.000 per year. Now that gives us a fighting chance against all those features. In fact it changes the narrative from working on feature <em>or</em> working on technical debt to: </p>



<blockquote><p>If you want to ship features faster, tackle technical debt.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Prioritising technical debt is cost reduction</h2>



<p>Developer productivity and cost of delay are just two examples how you can put technical debt into a financial context. In your organisation it might be infrastructure cost or developer churn or customer churn and dissatisfaction. </p>



<p>Translate technical debt into the language of business to put technical debt on your roadmap. Try to find an angle where you can reasonably estimate its impact and cost. If you can highlight how much revenue your organisation is leaving on the street it makes it much easier to prioritise technical debt.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>A Unified API aggregates many APIs in the same software category, making integration easier with a standard endpoint, authentication, and normalized data. This results in a consistent developer experience with less integration hassle.</p><p><img alt="What-is-a-Unified-API" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/d6o5ai4eeewt/4bmcK2owWmTkyz8dQrLgk3/bccc1d0493747688f26ea154745fa8ae/What-is-a-Unified-API.png"></p><h2>The Problem With API Integration</h2><p>There are many problems with your typical one-off API integration. To start, onboarding takes time and effort. You must research documentation, learn the HTTP methods, and handle custom objects and fields. You must figure out security schemes, ensure the API meets all requirements, test the API, and resolve errors (REST APIs are notorious for handling errors in different ways).</p><p>Once integrated, the work is just getting started â€” maintaining connections introduces several more hurdles. APIs are continually evolving, and developers must routinely adapt their integrations to new versions to avoid breaking changes. Documentation may be out of date, and the API may not offer SDKs in your preferred programming language.</p><p>All these headaches are amplified when aggregating multiple APIs from different providers. The APIs could utilize entirely different API styles (REST, RPC, SOAP, GraphQL, etc.). They may send payloads in various data formats (JSON, XML, etc.) and use different data models. Also, opaque rate limits could shut lights out for unsuspecting applications. As the number of integrations increases, ensuring regulatory compliance becomes exponentially more difficult.</p><p>The API economy is exploding with an increasing number of APIs across all sectors. While  standards like <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI</a> exist, the API industry is still largely fragmented, and each API has its own quirks. This makes it difficult for middleware, like finance, ERP, or CRM applications, to make reliable connections with multiple providers to meet their customers' integration requirements. Instead, they must repeat a cumbersome process for each unique  integration.</p><p><img alt="problem with API integration" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/d6o5ai4eeewt/6tqwHrTnYgYMiDgA49i7vk/d18b48416868abf5eb9d37820839f0eb/problem_with_API_integration.png"></p><h2>Introducing Unified APIs</h2><p>A Unified API is an abstraction layer that easily handles communication with many different APIs and backend data models. You can think of a Unified API as an airport hub that maintains relationships with airlines and helps route passengers to their destination of choice. The beauty  of a Unified API is its ability to offer a consistent API design and developer experience on par with Stripe and Twilio. </p><p>Unified APIs <strong>aggregate</strong> cloud providers in specific software categories, offering a single endpoint to areas like banking, accounting, CRM, leads, calendar, or email. By standardizing resources and data models across a single vertical, Unified APIs combine many services into a single integration â€” significantly decreasing redundancy. </p><p>A Unified API can also <strong>augment</strong> the data in transit and introduce PII (personal identifiable information) masking, field-level encryption, and an additional security gateway. This could provide a standard OAuth and scope management mechanism while allowing the flexibility to use unique Client IDs and secrets. Such an abstraction layer could also generate valuable support materials, such as libraries and SDKs, to streamline consumption. It could even convert a REST API to GraphQL without you doing any of the heavy lifting. Imagine, being able to query all your Salesforce and Stripe data through a GraphQL API!</p><p>Within the finance world, Unified APIs are typically called <em>API aggregators</em>. If you think about it, many of today's financial SaaS are essentially Unified APIs under the hood. Stripe, for example, connects with many payment providers to offer a single, seamless payment integration. Similarly, Plaid and Truelayer provide integrations with thousands of bank accounts. </p><h3>Examples of Unified APIs</h3><p>Unified APIs are becoming a popular way to integrate specific software categories. Some Unified API examples include: </p><ul><li><strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: Kloudless provides a unified Cloud Storage endpoint to access providers like Box, Google Drive, and OneDrive.</li><li><strong>Calendar</strong>: Nylas offers a unified Calendar API to synchronize gCal, iCloud, Outlook, and other popular calendars. </li><li><strong>CRM</strong>: Apideck Unify provides a <a href="https://www.apideck.com/crm-api">normalized CRM API</a> to instantly expose CRM connectors like Salesforce, Zoho, Airtable, Hubspot, and many others.</li><li><strong>Open Banking</strong>: <a href="https://www.openbankingtracker.com/">API Aggregators</a> like Plaid, Tink, Ibanity, Truelayer, and many more, provide API aggregation to access to consumer banking, transactions, and other financial data from banks and non-bank financial institutions.,</li><li><strong>Travel</strong>: Duffel provides an <a href="https://duffel.com/">airlines API</a> to search, book, and sell flights across a variety of airlines.</li><li><strong>Accounting</strong>: Codat's API integrates many accounting, banking, and commerce APIs from ClearBooks, QuickBooks, Zero, and others.</li><li><em>More Unified APIs</em>: Unified APIs are emerging for virtually all software categories, from team messaging, chat, email, shipping, and others. For a full list, check out our <a href="https://unifiedapis.io/">Unified APIs directory</a>.</li></ul><h2>Benefits of Unified APIs</h2><p>There are many benefits to utilizing a Unified API:</p><ul><li><strong>No integration pains</strong>: Unified APIs lower integration hurdles and makes the painful process of debugging APIs a thing of the past.</li><li><strong>Consolidated docs</strong>: No more reading a gazillion developer docs to make integrations. We all know the feeling. ðŸ•µðŸ�»â€�â™€ï¸�</li><li><strong>Solve compliance issues</strong>: A Unified API layer could help transform or mask potentially sensitive data (Personally Identifiable Information) to meet regulatory standards like HIPAA, PSD2, GDPR. </li><li><strong>Centralized logging</strong>: Unified APIs can centralize logging, increasing visibility and getting full observability out-of-the-box. </li><li><strong>Resource aliasing</strong>: Traditional integration development faces a fragmented taxonomy. A Unified API layer can create aliases to standardize terminologies across organizations, enabling you to use a common name per resource type.</li><li><strong>Normalized data</strong>: Unified APIs normalize data into a consumable format for easier ingestion.</li><li><strong>Domain model discovery</strong>: By mapping domain models across API vendors, it's much easier for developers to grasp specific APIs' scope and potential.</li><li><strong>Proxying requests</strong>: The ability to have a gateway that allows you to perform validation upfront and capture traffic going through all APIs.</li><li><strong>Simplifying webhooks</strong>: By standardizing events, a Unified API can make event-driven architecture more seamless.</li><li><strong>Standardized pagination and filtering</strong>: You know what you're going to get. Unified APIs make pagination, filtering, and sorting more consistent. They could also help avoid under-fetching and over-fetching.</li><li><strong>Lower maintenance cost</strong>: A unified API takes care of versioning downstream APIs to facilitate ongoing maintenance.</li><li><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: A Unified API could help future-proof connections, especially for AI use cases. Through machine-readable standards like <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, an aggregator could extract helpful metadata and even pinpoint real-life objects.</li><li><strong>API Augmentation</strong>: With common libraries and SDKs, Unified APIs can support more developer preferences and programming languages. </li></ul><h2>Potential Downsides of Unified APIs</h2><p>Unified APIs could significantly improve the overall integration experience. However, if implemented incorrectly, unified APIs present some potential negatives. Thankfully, most can be mitigated with the right setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Latency</strong>: Adding an extra hop into the mix will introduce extra milliseconds.</li><li><strong>Vendor lock-in</strong>: You're adding another dependency to your stack. <em>Conversely, a single API integration could decrease future migration concerns.</em></li><li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: Adding another data processor increases liability, especially if sharing confidential data with a third party. <em>Unified APIs must be GDPR-compliant and encrypt data in transit to meet PSD2, CCPA, and other regulations.</em></li><li><strong>Lowest common denominator effect</strong>: If you're choosing commonalities across many APIs, you lose intricacies of downstream payloads. <em>A robust unified API should enable access to the full payload for power users and support <a href="https://medium.com/@grace_62874/how-unified-apis-work-with-custom-fields-ac655dbc2463">custom fields</a>.</em></li><li><strong>Data standardization qualms</strong>: To support the Unified API concept, you need a smart abstraction layer. <em>Common data models for specific software categories must be impeccably designed.</em></li><li><strong>Reliability</strong>: According to <a href="https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/api-strategies/#api-strategies">Postman's 2020 report</a>, 71.6% of developers say reliability is the most important factor of API integration. <em>Abstraction layers upon APIs must not introduce outages.</em></li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: An abstraction layer could cost money. However, <em>you gain velocity and time to market, equatable to revenue.</em></li></ul><p>Unified APIs do admittedly present some drawbacks, namely increased latency, added costs, and data compliance concerns. Thus, to offset any potential disadvantages, Unified APIs must expose an open, robust, encrypted platform where the time saved on integration dramatically outweighs the cost.</p><h2>A Unified API Movement is Underway</h2><p>Let's face it; integration is a skill in its own right. That's why Unified APIs are so intriguing â€” by unifying many tailored integrations in one endpoint, developers can offset the integration pains and free up time to work on their core business.</p><p>By augmenting the consumption experience, Unified APIs can normalize data models, bake in compliance and security models, and increase developer experience with standard documentation and support libraries. Even though the concept is relatively new, <a href="https://unifiedapis.io/">many unified APIs already exist</a>, underscoring their market validity.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How Infinitus helped VaccinateCA improve their coverage of Covid-19 vaccination sites by automating calls to 2500 pharmacies every day.</p></div><div><div><p>It all started when our CEO Ankit was tagged on a tweet:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d57edde4b089996f4_I_MtQLyy7YWzCtfAiaxFhcmMkrcwEnW-98Us4QJYixOqGaFqeq3uTcxZo6pkaw78gO4bKrJR8Fffvwonapk3gpmSk-XzoQWgOP7hZUbqzZvZC2DsT2rrEqNVB17lLpnKQxCCLMz3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>At Infinitus, we automate repetitive, routine phone calls so our customers can focus on the more creative and empathetic parts of their businesses. Over the past two years, we have built a platform that collects data on behalf of tens of thousands of healthcare providers to help their patients access and afford therapies as efficiently as possible. When we learned that VaccinateCA volunteers were calling hundreds of local pharmacies daily to check for vaccine availability, we asked ourselves: how can our platform help this volunteer effort?</p><figure id="w-node-_5486cc49-4b64-1119-94c9-d7485b84ba76-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a4a9679f268411d14b00f_Screen%20Shot%202021-02-02%20at%2010.59.30%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Timeline from first contact to production and a transcript of one of our first successful test calls</figcaption></figure><p>The VaccinateCA phone calls can be broken into two parts - first, identifying whether the vaccine is available, and second, how to get the vaccine. The majority of phone calls never make it past the first question. In fact, volunteers were only getting a 10% hit rate over the 200 calls they were able to make in a day. What if we could help the volunteers focus on the more exploratory work of figuring out who can get vaccines and how, and let us figure out where the vaccine is available?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how we built it:</p><h2>Phase 1. Adapt Infrastructure for New Use Case</h2><p>The Infinitus VoiceRPA platform is designed to automate phone calls. While our system is currently tuned for a few use cases, one of our goals for 2021 is to make a platform where we can quickly configure and automate any new call type. We planned to leverage our existing system as much as possible so we could get this project out the door fast. We created a new Covid Vaccination call type and a workspace for storing the data.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428dfb556cc89a26ef76_MH7Dyc-9NLpmZIatKQLSvAZsfA_ADFdYaIG7GImrhv2dWWbM-FfMT5Dl0S0rNx3Ua-sinCe-MpmQsHOEmkalMMcoYhIkMkEvABXU8D2CVnOu-XC98Mkg6csDcGPw-4vb3S-mhbKt.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The Infinitus Technology Stack</figcaption></figure><p>The volunteers at VaccinateCA provided our team with a list of thousands of hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that they were calling. We limited our scope to big pharmacy chains which have a large number of locations with standardized IVR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response">Interactive Voice Response</a>) systems. They were also the most likely places to have vaccine availability across the state.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a day, the Covid Vaccination workspace was filled with pharmacies and phone numbers, all displayed in the same internal tools currently used by our data labeling team.</p><h2>Phase 2. Refine the Conversation Model</h2><p>The volunteers at VaccinateCA follow this script for their phone calls:</p><ul role="list"><li>Is the vaccine available for those 65 years and older?</li><li>Where can appointments be made?</li><li>Are walk-ins accepted?&nbsp;</li><li>What documentation is needed?</li></ul><p>We dedicated two members of our data labeling team to prepare the data to call pharmacies. They guided our digital assistant, Eva, through calls to (a) generate training data for our NLP team to automate future calls and (b) validate if pharmacists would be willing to talk to a digital assistant. Here’s what an early call sounded like:</p><p>The results were promising - pharmacists were providing the information we were looking for, but, as expected, we encountered a few challenges:</p><h4>1. Some pharmacists were not sure what to do when a digital assistant called them.</h4><figure id="w-node-b7e45f80-7c74-e54e-32f5-8797a3059363-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d108eb65d7911a316_XPM4l0fV9unhDxCqe-uyBPL5ZRVMBDY2a-_00VDUM1uquJjZNHCVFBhJf9Ra9SclJM7upP4EuUcJ2Rpcmid80O_s2wmZ9XbBMQrBq90ChQCzZ1d1HjTiuxhjVBv9B5CcgjvO96Iu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Between 25-30% of pharmacists who heard Eva’s automated voice, hung up without interacting with her.&nbsp;</p><p>To combat these outright hangups, we followed up with those pharmacies to explain who we are calling on behalf of and why, and asking if in the future they would be willing to talk to our digital assistant.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>2. Difficulty detecting when to start asking questions.<br></h4><p>A person can easily differentiate between a pharmacist, an IVR system, or when they’re on hold, because humans subconsciously use signals like how ‘real’ a voice sounds and background noise. Humans also use signals such as pauses and changing intonations as cues to know when someone is ready for us to ask a question.<br></p><p>Our current Natural Language Understanding model processes incoming voice through a speech-to-text engine first, thereby eliminating some of the audio-based nuances a human can use to guide a conversation. For some pharmacy calls it is hard to tell from just the text if the pharmacist is ready for questions, or if they still need us to wait on hold.<br></p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-e8df9944-846d-a16f-b8f6-397c33be13c7-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d57edde3aa69996f5_2R137_qS0jIN5Stj5eP8EdQXxvr6bHXOQmWrNXDXOHJyIi5PtJ0YuYVmvVjsEk8vvep9tcw3rE2nnWCad2lg90OKuDL7xKPKX_HEDvpcHG57GKLMtPeQw866Hx64zSLrRMzdG5FK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Consider the following examples of common phrases that can appear in the IVR, but are also commonly used by pharmacists:</p><p><strong>“How can I help you today?”</strong></p><p>In this case, the system expects a button press or a phrase like “speak to a pharmacist” to help direct the call. However, a pharmacist may use the exact same verbiage when picking up the phone, indicating that we should start asking our vaccine related questions.<br></p><p><strong>“Please hold for a moment.”</strong></p><p>If we interpret this as something to respond to, the IVR system can route our call in unexpected ways. However, if a pharmacist asks us to continue to hold and doesn’t hear a response right away, they often hang up.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>“Thank you for calling Rite Aid.”</strong></p><p>If we hear this in the IVR, we want to wait and listen to the menu options and press the appropriate number on a keypad. However, pharmacists also say this when picking up the phone. It is critical to ask questions as soon as we are connected to a pharmacist, otherwise they assume no one is on the line and will hang up.</p><p>‍</p><h4>3. Variation in responses from free-form questions</h4><figure id="w-node-_6c6157e9-3177-b5f2-8e36-9aad4be7a260-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d59087960f81bd2d2_q_yj6nvFeOONto65FyIf6brM9LzBd2clk_84qdS71j074E-78rU1ifwmroEQmzGS1IuHoDOPoFOOrMRPaJslDBhMrUzqcTvn1yycIHzXvp0pIC9Be3-Yy5NoKSGtokqrLARF-8HJ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Responses to yes or no questions can be understood at a much higher confidence with a smaller set of training data than open-ended questions. For example, the answer to “Where can appointments be made?” results in harder to understand responses like “Do the County of Alameda.”, which was a mistranscription of something like “Through the County of Alameda [website]”.</p><p>We also noticed that the chances of a pharmacist hanging up on us increased with the length of the call. Combined with the insight that the majority of volunteers’ phone calls never made it past the first question in the script, we realized we could streamline volunteer efforts by automating the question, “Is the vaccine available for those 65 and older?” Eva could pre-screen a much larger pool of sites, and have the volunteers follow-up only in cases where the answer was “yes”.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Phase 3. Full Automation</h2><p>To automatically navigate IVRs, we collected the scripts that the IVR systems follow. As long as a location belongs to a pharmacy chain (e.g. Rite Aid) whose IVR we have automated, we know what the IVR will say, except for some minor variations like the location’s address. Using fuzzy matching, we built a state machine which responds with the appropriate key press or voice response until we are put on hold to connect to a pharmacist.<br></p><figure id="w-node-_8d2d4741-0562-fd84-5c48-0d60d3f721cb-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428e4e028a520cbea1bf_-FeYyvb_mX7wjwX-Zk85DYOpRlGnj9JVe12V4GWeqbBfIjLQ3p2ygjhoyr3sirf5yM0RaFTxuCDSJEbIptL1PUw12Kr2WoMee9H02yKPi98ZQurlsjJUtflNq4phrPcLQ7R49Xj2.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once on hold, we get a continuous speech-to-text transcript and pass it to our trained model. If someone picks up and says something like “Hi, how can I help you today?”, the model classifies it as a greeting and Eva asks the covid vaccine availability question. We got around the confusion of phrases used in the IVR and by humans picking up by enabling the hold model only once the IVR portion of the call is complete.</p><p>Finally, for the conversation itself, we focused on one question: “Does your location have the covid-19 vaccine?” Because the volunteers use this data to determine which sites to call back, we want it to be as accurate as possible. If the system gets a response that it doesn’t understand yet (it’s still improving), it will ask a follow up question “Could you please answer yes or no. Do you have covid-19 vaccines?” If we still don’t get an understandable answer, we call back another time.<br></p><p>Each day, Eva calls pharmacies that haven’t been confirmed to have vaccines yet (since this information changes daily). These calls are now fully automated, from navigating each pharmacy’s automated IVR, detecting when a pharmacist is on the line, and finally extracting the response from the pharmacist and saying bye before hanging up.<br></p><p>We have been supplying the results of our calls to the volunteers at VaccinateCA, who then prioritize positive cases to confirm additional details (such as who’s eligible, how to make appointments, etc.).&nbsp;</p><h2>Beyond California</h2><p>Last week, we expanded our support to volunteer groups mirroring the efforts of VaccinateCA. We are now supporting groups in Colorado, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our Impact</h2><figure id="w-node-_9943b8a9-7511-961f-4f76-5d17724f8253-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428e10a41b21690f668e_PbhUak00017R-LVSLvuO1md5n7GtubjnigyLepLSVf5Gbi4pIAJ7IdAqOxu2aNEGb0I0i7Hdg61Ejam2BPyhT2F4Az_EFGKC-zLOzmbSCALoQ5M93swtpog5DAJV5n_zolRoZduO.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Comment about Eva in the VaccinateCA Discord channel</figcaption></figure><p>Over the past two weeks, we have made over 10,000 calls to pharmacies across 8 states. After the initial implementation phase, we’ve mostly been able to sit back and let the machine do its job. The data we’ve provided back to the group has proved immensely valuable, increasing the efficacy of their volunteer callers by an order of magnitude.</p><blockquote>Working with Infinitus has been game-changing for our effort at VaccinateCA! In under a week, their digital assistant automated daily phone calls to 2500 pharmacies across California.

                                                        <p><strong>Researchers develop robust approach for detecting market manipulation</strong></p>

<p>Social media is increasingly used to spread fake news. The same problem can be found on the capital market – criminals spread fake news about companies in order to manipulate share prices. Researchers at the Universities of Göttingen and Frankfurt and the Jožef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana have developed an approach that can recognise such fake news, even when the news contents are repeatedly adapted. The results of the study were published in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems.</p>

<p>In order to detect false information – often fictitious data that presents a company in a positive light – the scientists used machine learning methods and created classification models that can be applied to identify suspicious messages based on their content and certain linguistic characteristics. "Here we look at other aspects of the text that makes up the message, such as the comprehensibility of the language and the mood that the text conveys," says Professor Jan Muntermann from the University of Göttingen.</p>

<p>The approach is already known in principle from its use by spam filters, for example. However, the key problem with the current methods is that to avoid being recognised, fraudsters continuously adapt the content and avoid certain words that are used to identify the fake news. This is where the researchers' new approach comes in: to identify fake news despite such strategies to evade detection, they combine models recently developed by the researchers in such a way that high detection rates and robustness come together. So even if "suspicious" words disappear from the text, the fake news is still recognised by its linguistic features. "This puts scammers into a dilemma. They can only avoid detection if they change the mood of the text so that it is negative, for instance," explains Dr Michael Siering. "But then they would miss their target of inducing investors to buy certain stocks."</p>

<p>The new approach can be used, for example, in market surveillance to temporarily suspend the trading of affected stocks. In addition, it offers investors valuable information to avoid falling for such fraud schemes. It is also possible that it could be used for criminal prosecutions in the future.</p>

        <p><em>Hey! Today I have something different for you. Itâ€™s a piece about the weird world of LinkedIn â€” from celebrity </em>workfluencers<em> to the strange social features that feel out of place. This is a guest essay from <a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi">Fadeke Adegbuyi</a>, senior marketing manager at Doist and a fan of all things internet culture. I think youâ€™re going to like it! ðŸ˜†</em></p><p><em>- Nathan</em></p><p><em> </em>LinkedIn is the fucking worst.</p><p>Despite our collective confusion about the platform, its enthusiastic embrace by HR departments and recruiters has ensured its success. Even though it was <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/2020/july/a-message">forced to lay off 1,000 employees</a> because of the pandemic, they still increased their&nbsp;Q<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2020-Q4/press-release-webcast">4 revenue by 10%.</a> As of Q3 of 2020, the company has over 722 million users and is truly internationalâ€“â€“just 26% of their members are based in North America. With revenue largely powered by recruiting solutions, paid job listings, and advertising, LinkedIn knows how to appeal to businesses at scale. LinkedIn doesnâ€™t need <em>you</em> to like it.</p><p>But, the companyâ€™s consumer-side remains in the midst of a long-standing identity crisis. Feature bloat and odd idiosyncrasies make the site a superbly strange social network. Many of us have profiles but donâ€™t log in for months at a time. Our â€œAboutâ€� sections point to better ways to be reached. Others, seemingly alive and well, have claimed on their pages to have died.</p><p>LinkedIn bills itself as an online destination, like a conference held at a 5-star hotel where big thinkers give big speeches, deals get made in private corners, and you can â€œbuild and engage with your professional network.â€� But many of us see it as a not-so-funhouse, with wacky mirrors, jumpout surprises, and peculiar attractions. Can I interest you in a tour?</p><h2>Copy-Cat Cemetery&nbsp;</h2><p>LinkedIn recently released Stories, a vertical video feature copied from Instagram, who better stole it from Snapchat. LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Stories%20enable%20members%20and,of%20their%20everyday%20professional%20moments.&amp;text=LinkedIn%20shares%20Stories%20that%20you,recent%20version%20of%20the%20app.">suggests</a> users â€œshare images and short videos of their everyday professional moments.â€� Released in the midst of a global pandemic during a mass migration to remote work, itâ€™s unclear whether we should showcase cramped work setups on kitchen tables or restless kindergarteners interrupting the 143rd minute of a Zoom.&nbsp;</p><p>Available only on LinkedIn's iOS and Android apps, this begs the question...<em><strong>Who is using LinkedIn on their phone?</strong></em> The platform would like you to believe that celebrities are. A permanent Story from LinkedIn shows a reel of workfluencers â€“â€“Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, Deepak Chopra â€“â€“ posting professionally shot high-definition videos of their work days.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png"></a></p><p>A tagline ends the montage: â€œShare your story.â€� At last glance, only a single one of my 1000+ connections is using the feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Twitter is seeing early success with Fleets, their own copy-cat story feature that users have been receptive to, posting baby photos and dog pictures in between subtweets and shitposts. Feature imitation isnâ€™t a bad strategy. But LinkedIn Stories was dead on arrival. No one in the boardroom asked the critical question: <em>Who cares?</em></p><h2>The Audio Trolls</h2><p>Audio apps, like Clubhouse, Chalk, and Rodeo point to the power of sound-based social. Twitter released voice tweets earlier this spring and is currently working on an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">audio spaces feature</a>. LinkedIn has taken their own steps into voice with a handful of audio features. Like most things on the platform, they feel out of place.&nbsp;</p><p>The sentiment behind their name pronunciation feature on personal profiles is a positive one, but hasnâ€™t seen wide adoption for its intended purpose. Since the feature was launched, Iâ€™ve heard people with the most pronounceable of names use the feature for anything from inserting a 10-second clip from The Office to playing a song snippet at 2x speed. A now common but unintended use case is delightful trolling:</p><ul><li>At one point, Jeff Hui used the feature to ironically <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffistyping/status/1304947619651817477?s=21">shout an elevator pitch at recruiters</a></li><li>On Riva-Melissa Tezâ€™s profile, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riva-melissa-tez-661a0aab/">she declares herself â€œQueen Beeâ€�</a></li><li>Ben Taylor, who includes â€œclick 4 soundâ€� in his name, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata/">rickrolls his profile visitors</a></li></ul><p>On a site where people declare Ivy League associations, summa cum laude status, and internships at investment banks, cheeky irreverence for work culture warps the throughline of respectability that LinkedIn intends. Trolling LinkedIn, while on LinkedIn, is a break from the BusinessTM of polished headshots and corporately crafted â€œExperienceâ€� sections. Itâ€™s ironic participation on a platform where youâ€™re <em>meant</em> to be performing professionalism.&nbsp;</p><p>At times, it feels like LinkedIn is actively building features for the intended purpose of trolling. Within LinkedIn messages, users can hold down a microphone icon to record their voice. An audio snippet is an oddly intimate option for starting a professional conversation with a stranger. Perhaps thatâ€™s the point. But attempting to speed up relationships with overly familiar features is a â€œpersonal touchâ€� unwelcome in the world of networking, already so fraught with faux pas.</p><p>An innocent but outlandish 39-second audio message, sent by â€œ<a href="https://twitter.com/okcandice_/status/1285956830045380608?s=21">Jimmy from LinkedIn</a>â€� went viral as a case of networking-gone-not-quite-right:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>â€œHello Candice, how are you doing and good morning. How have you been? Hey Candice, this is me, Jimmy from LinkedIn. And the reason I was giving you this quick voice message call was to say thank you so kindly. I really appreciate that you have accepted me here on the LinkedIn platform. What we will do is learn from each-other. I appreciate your kindness. Jimmy from LinkedIn.â€�</blockquote><p>Though it doesnâ€™t feel malicious, itâ€™s just <em>off</em> to encounter this kind of weirdness in the same space you seek new job opportunities and professional updates from former colleagues and classmates. Itâ€™s the stuff that makes you pause and say, <em>Where am I?</em></p><h2>InMail Infinity</h2><p>The premise of the platform, bringing professionals together, is a challenging one from the start. People hate networking. Also, theyâ€™re bad at it.&nbsp;</p><p>For users, LinkedIn â€œnetworkingâ€� often means receiving a barrage of InMail and connection requests. You might recognize some or all of these:</p><ol><li><strong>The bad sales pitch</strong>: Sales people and business development people will slide into DMs to peddle their companyâ€™s products, whether youâ€™re the right person to buy or not. Usually not.</li><li><strong>The professional neg</strong>: Recruiters ask senior level employees if theyâ€™re interested in entry level roles or, better yet, internships.</li><li><strong>The just-in-case connection</strong>: Industry peers will suggest itâ€™s â€œmutually beneficialâ€� to connect, but donâ€™t specify these benefits up front.</li><li><strong>The endangered business school</strong>: Admissions teams are now online shilling once-coveted seats in their dwindling MBA programs. Based on your profile and experience, they think youâ€™re a â€œgreat fitâ€� and want you to apply.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The eager seeker</strong>: Some people see LinkedIn messages as an alternative resume and cover letter submission portal. This is why that endless string of people in your messages inquire about roles outside your departmentâ€¦ or outside your company.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The LinkedIn team</strong>: If their emails notifying you about connection requests wasnâ€™t enough, LinkedIn also maintains a direct line to your InMail. Expect prompts to try Premium, credits to advertise your company, and messages about whatever else theyâ€™re feeling.</li><li><strong>The proposition</strong>: Linkedin stands in the long-tradition of <em>every</em> site becoming a dating site. Or, er, a place to sexually harass people. If you havenâ€™t gotten one of these messages in your InMail, you know someone who has.</li></ol><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png"></a></p><p>Overfull InMail and random connection requests feels like a never-ending chore. You get enough work emails and donâ€™t need any more. LinkedInâ€™s constant drip of communication is just more work on top of the real work you have to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Linkedinâ€™s inbox infinity isnâ€™t just annoyingâ€”it detracts from the usability of the platform. Unless youâ€™re embracing a new position of processing and answering everything that comes through, if a real connection came along, how would you know?</p><h2>The Cursed Timeline</h2><p>At any given point on your LinkedIn timeline, youâ€™ll see a corporate blog post shared by someone you know, a marketing sales pitch from someone you donâ€™t, and a news story about COVID-19. Their timeline is similar in this way to other social networks, where you see posts made or liked by your connections, people and brands you follow, and promoted posts that people pay to get in front of you. This cacophony of content is bizarre, but not atypical â€“â€“ social feeds optimize for engagement, here as everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatâ€™s uniquely odd about LinkedIn is that it is not unique. â€œThe professional networkâ€� is still just a social network. Though the topics of the posts in your timeline may be on the world of work, diving into the comments, you can see polarization in action. Inspirational posts on giving parents grace while working from home during the pandemic have angry rants suggesting that kids are a personal choice and their burden shouldnâ€™t be foisted upon colleagues. Beneath articles on workplace harassment, sympathetic discussions ensue on why someone might naturally retaliate after being romantically rebuffed. A political article about the 2020 US presidential election draws comments on whether former President Barack Obama was really Black.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png"></a></p><p>In a time when the collective conversation is consumed by the topic of human cancellation, people readily post things on LinkedIn that make them fireable or unhireable.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png"></a></p><p>While these comments are nothing new in terms of online culture, they feel out of bounds on a professional website where people use their full names and disclose precisely where they work and the city they live in. In the alternate universe of LinkedIn, cancel culture either doesnâ€™t exist, its inhabitants are blissfully unaware, or they simply donâ€™t care.</p><p><a href="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1423/optimized_befe2496-abfd-4e7a-a29f-8dc8a3889521_1600x259.png"></a></p><h2>The Rockstar Recruiters</h2><p>The strangest of Linkedinâ€™s features isnâ€™t a feature at all; itâ€™s a specific set of power users.&nbsp;</p><p>Every platform has its royalty.

is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H.

Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

<p>curl is an internet transfer engine. A rather modular one too. Parts of curl’s functionality is provided by selectable alternative implementations that we call <em>backends</em>. You select what backends to enable at build-time and in many cases the backends are enabled and powered by different 3rd party libraries.</p>



<h2>Many backends</h2>



<p>curl has a range of such alternative backends for various features: </p>



<ol><li>International Domain Names</li><li>Name resolving</li><li>TLS</li><li>SSH</li><li>HTTP/3</li><li>HTTP content encoding</li><li>HTTP</li></ol>



<h2>Stable API and ABI</h2>



<p>Maintaining a stable API and ABI is key to libcurl. As long as those promises are kept, changing internals such as switching between backends is perfectly fine.</p>



<p>The API is the armored front door that we don’t change. The backends is the garden on the back of the house that we can dig up and replant every year if we want, without us having to change the front door.</p>



<h2>TLS backends</h2>



<p>Already back in 2005 we added support for using an alternative TLS library in curl when we added support for GnuTLS in addition to OpenSSL, and since then we’ve added many more.  We do this by having an internal API through which we do all the TLS related things and for each third party library we support we have code that does the necessary logic to connect the internal API with the corresponding TLS library.</p>



<h2>rustls</h2>



<p>Today, we merged support for yet another TLS library: <strong><a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">rustls</a></strong>. This is a TLS library written in rust and it has a C API provided in a separate project called <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/crustls/">crustls</a>. Strictly speaking, curl is built to use crustls.</p>



<p>This is still early days for the rustls backend and it is not yet feature complete. There’s more work to do and polish to apply before we can think of it as a proper competitor to the already established and well-used TLS backends, but with this merge it makes it much easier for more people to help out and test it out. Feel free and encouraged to join in!</p>



<p>We count this addition as the <strong>14th</strong> concurrently supported TLS library in curl. I’m not aware of any other project, anywhere, that supports more or even this many TLS libraries.</p>

<h2>rustls again!</h2>



<p>The TLS library named <a href="https://mesalink.io/">mesalink</a> is actually already using rustls, but under an OpenSSL API disguise and we support that since a few years back…</p>



<h2>Credits</h2>



<p>The TLS backend code for rustls was written and contributed by Jacob Hoffman-Andrews.</p>

<p>Until now, most cybersecurity efforts have focused on controlling network access by outsiders or end users. The greatest harm, however, is likely to come from insiders—system administrators, network architects, system analysts, developers, and site reliability engineers—who often have authorized access to data, networks, and applications. They may misuse or abuse their access to steal or damage sensitive data. Breaches may also occur unintentionally due to lax security protocols. It’s estimated that <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/insider-threats-reponsible-for-43/" rel=" noopener">43% of all breaches are committed by insiders</a>—both accidental and intentional.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Probably one of the most infamous examples of intentional insider breaches is the case of Edward Snowden, a Booz Allen contractor working with the NSA. In 2013, Snowden, stole nearly 2 million intelligence files in what is considered one of the biggest thefts of US secrets in history. As a system administrator and architect, Snowden had unlimited access to NSA systems, and he was also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-09/pentagon-finds-snowden-took-1-7-million-files-rogers-says" rel=" noopener">able to access files from other sites, including those of other countries</a>.<sup>2</sup> The incursions continue to occur. In 2019, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-twitter-employees-charged-with-spying-for-saudi-arabia-by-digging-into-the-accounts-of-kingdom-critics/2019/11/06/2e9593da-00a0-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html" rel=" noopener">two Twitter employees were charged with spying</a> for Saudi Arabia by accessing information on Saudi Arabian dissidents who used the Twitter platform.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Even when organizations secure their own systems internally, the threat of intrusion through third parties remains. The more third parties that may access your IT data and networks, the higher the risk of a breach. One of the more publicized early breaches involved the hack of Target’s point of sale systems using the login of an approved HVAC supplier, resulting in stolen data of 40 million debit and credit cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bad actors present credentials that make them appear to be insiders. Marriott revealed unauthorized hacking had exposed the personal information of 383 million guests—and that the hacking had occurred undetected for nearly five years. The company blamed Chinese hackers for the breach. In high-risk geographies, government agencies may cross the line as well. Hostile state actors may be using hardware attacks that can’t be detected until the stolen information is used months or years later.</p>
<p>The move to cloud-based computing only compounds the problem, since there is limited accountability and control over the personnel at IT cloud platform providers who are able to access your files. A data breach at Capital One in early 2019 exposed the personal data of over 100 million bank customers and applicants—including social security numbers, credit scores, dates of birth, and linked bank account numbers. The perpetrator was a former cloud employee, who boasted online about what she’d done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The costs of these threats are enormous. In addition to direct financial losses in the millions of dollars and a negative impact on the stock price, disclosure of trade secrets may have long-term implications. Business reputation take a hit as customers lose confidence in the company’s ability to safeguard personal information. There may be fines for noncompliance with privacy regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or significant regulatory implications in some industries. Marriott was hit with a $123 million GDPR fine. The fine against British Airways for exposing payment and personal information of 500,000 customers was even worse: $230 million.</p></span></p>

Starting her career as a programmer and switching to law, Heather has been focused on software licensing for the last 25 years. She's worked with some of the most famous open source software companies and projects in the world and has an amazingly balanced view of the space and the role that licensing can/should and does play within the ecosystem. We were able to cover the history of open source, interpretations of different licenses and examples of projects/companies that are getting it right.</p><p>As we got deeper into the discussion, I asked Heather if there was a point where the licensing changed to enable the successful open source projects we see today. She had this to say which was an amazing point of view coming from someone with so much experience in the space:</p><p><em>The reason it was successful is that it was a great product. I don’t mean to be flippant but without that, the license wouldn’t have worked. It’s the license that serves the business and not vice versa.</em></p><p>If you are thinking about which license to use for your open source project or what makes the most sense for your business, you should definitely listen to this talk. </p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>-Ben</p></div><h2>Episode Transcript</h2><div><p><strong>Heather, thank you for your time. It's great to have you on. For the readers, do you want to give us a brief overview of who you are and why I'm talking to you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Thank you for having me on. I'm a lawyer and a venture capitalist, and in both of those roles I focus heavily on open source software. A bit of color about that: I've been a lawyer in Silicon Valley for about 25 years. Before that, I was once a computer programmer, and it was long ago that we called ourselves “computer programmers.” Everything I did professionally in computing is outdated now, but I've had fun learning from my clients over the years. As a lawyer, I am essentially a technology transactions lawyer, meaning that I do licensing and commercial deals. My specialty has always been software licensing, because software is interesting to me. A few years, I got involved in a venture capital fund, Open Source Software Capital, which focuses entirely on early-stage commercial open source companies. One of the reasons I did that was that my law practice had become more and more about advising people on business strategy around open source. That is inextricably bound up with licensing strategy. It was a more natural move than you might expect for a lawyer-type like me. Now those things are dovetailing nicely. I spent a lot of time talking to small companies about how to set their business and licensing strategy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I remember the first time I heard the phrase or came into contact with open source software was a CD on the front of a magazine in 1995. It was a copy of Slack for Linux. I remember me and my friends were spending days and days trying to get it up and running. It meant that we could stop programming because we had Sonos terminal at the time at the university. It meant that we could start coding at home instead of having to go and see the university. When did you first hear the phrase?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It probably was around that time, 1995, 1996. At that time, I had been a lawyer for a brief amount of time and my clients were asking me about the software. They asked, “Can we use this software under this license?” They were referring to various licenses, a lot of them permissive, like MIT licenses and so forth, but also licenses like GPL and LGPL, which nobody in the legal community understood at the time. At that time, I was boots on the ground in terms of clients saying, “Can we do this? Can we use this?” It was free and they wanted to use it. The general attitude of lawyers at that time was like when your mother says, “Don't put that in your mouth, you don't know where it's been.”&nbsp;</p><p>They considered open source dangerous, but the reason they considered it dangerous was it didn't come from a commercial vendor. It could have infringement issues and so forth. Most of the lawyers at that time were saying, “No, you can't use that.” I realized quickly, because I was the one that they were asking every day, that was the wrong answer. It had to be, “Yes, but,” instead of “No.” I thought, I need to figure out what is that condition, “Yes, but if you do this, you can use it.” There was nobody in the law trying to figure that out from that perspective at that time. I looked around and there wasn't any information about it. There's a lot of philosophy about open source. There wasn't much that was for somebody who was making this decision on a practical level day to day on behalf of a private enterprise.&nbsp;</p><p>I started developing those things myself and trying to learn more and more about it. The rule of being in an organization is that if you know 10% more than the person in the next room, you're the expert. People kept asking me about this stuff and I kept trying to answer the best I could, with little to go on. More people asked me questions and I learned more, and gave more answers, and it kept snowballing. I thought, “This will go away. It will be the flavor of the month.” It never went away. After the internet bust in around 2000, 2001, it took off. That's when I decided that this was going to be my area. This is what I'm going to do with my legal career.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You didn't have that light bulb moment when you came into contact with it in ‘95 or ‘96 that like, “This is going to change the world.” I didn’t. I thought it was great that someone was giving this operating system away for free, but I remember I discovered the web around the same time. It's within a minute of using Mosaic that you knew the world was never going to be the same.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I don't think many people realized it. The reason was that at that time, open source was considered a hobbyist thing. People could not have foreseen how widely accepted it would become, much less becoming the entire backbone of the internet, which everybody perceived immediately was going to change the world. It was the internet bust that caused it to skyrocket, because people were casting around desperately to save money. All of these big companies that otherwise never would have considered Linux seriously, all of a sudden they started saying, “We're going to throw our hats in the ring here.” That in itself was the amazing thing to me. It got people to collaborate in a way that they had never collaborated before. That was the sea change. Businesses started saying, “We can collaborate with our worst competitors on this infrastructure stuff.” That was what changed things for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I was working around that time. I was an engineer. I remember hearing how much people or my clients were paying 6, 7 digits for software that you wouldn't dream of paying anything for nowadays. What were the risks for someone who's not legally minded? What was the thing that was frightening people at that time? What's the worst case?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>First, beyond any real risk, people just didn't understand the licenses. People don't like things they don't understand. Not understanding things is risk. Let's lay that aside, because that's irrational. The real risk that they were worried about from a legal point of view was that the software would be infringing, and that can happen one of two ways. One way is that somebody took something they didn't have the right to use and put it in the software. In legal terms, that would be either copyright infringement or trade secret misappropriation, depending on how they did it and how much they copied and so forth. The other risk is quite different, and that's patent infringement. That can happen even if you don't improperly take something else.&nbsp;</p><p>For years and years, people had been buying software from commercial vendors who gave them some comfort in the form of an indemnity. If the software was infringing, that vendor would take care of that problem for them. With open source, you usually don't have that. There are some vendors now who offer indemnities, but at the time there was no such thing at all. People were concerned that if they used software and it was infringing, then they would be flapping out in the wind and there would be no vendor to help them.&nbsp;</p></div><div><blockquote>“<!-- -->They asked, “Can we use this software under this license?” They were referring to various licenses, a lot of them permissive like MIT licenses and so forth, but also licenses GPL and LGPL which nobody in the legal community understood at the time. <!-- -->”</blockquote></div><div><p><strong>It's where the buck stops if there's a problem. Talk a bit about the history of that. Which side was driving that? Was it the commercial side of the internet driving the changing in feelings and the licensing around that, or was it the other way around?</strong></p><p>What changed it was that people decided they needed something inexpensive enough that they were willing to bear the risk. At the same time, commercial vendors, like famously Microsoft, although they had changed their tune by now, they were creating what people call FUD -- Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt -- about these issues because they were competing with Linux. If I can make an aside, it’s interesting that at the time, Windows was so dominant that the only thing that could have competed with it was not a commercial product. All of a sudden, they had this competition and they were trying to throw shade on it. They caused people to change the way they've thought about it. Interestingly, a lot of lawyers still have these ideas in their mind that come from that time and the FUD that Microsoft created. We even see provisions in documents that came from that time. They were effective in causing people to be concerned about it because they were competing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That was several years ago. I remember that time well.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lawyers are slow to change. What they do is they go, “I know about this risk. I have to identify it. That's my job.” It's difficult to get them to stop when the risk is no longer significant anymore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One of the things I've noticed when I've …</strong></p></div></div></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the previous parts of this series we studied the core of the CPython interpreter and saw how the most fundamental aspects of Python are implemented. We made an overview of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the CPython VM</a>, took a look at <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the CPython compiler</a>, stepped through <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">the CPython source code</a>, studied <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">how the VM executes the bytecode</a> and learned <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">how variables work</a>. In the two most recent posts we focused on <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">the Python object system</a>. We learned what Python objects and Python types are, how they are defined and what determines their behavior. This discussion gave us a good understanding of how Python objects work in general. What we haven't discussed is how particular objects, such as strings, integers and lists, are implemented. In this and several upcoming posts we'll cover the implementations of the most important and most interesting built-in types. The subject of today's post is <code>int</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Why Python integers are interesting</h2>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">arbitrary-precision integers</a>, also known as bignums. This means that they can be as large as we want, and their sizes are only limited by the amount of available memory.</p>
<p>Bignums are handy to work with because we don't need to worry about such things as integer overflows and underflows. They are extensively used in fields like cryptography and computer algebra where large numbers arise all the time and must be represented precisely. So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arbitrary-precision_arithmetic_software">many</a> programming languages have bignums built-in. These include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Haskell, Erlang, Julia, Racket. Others provide bignums as a part of the standard library. These include Go, Java, C#, D, PHP. Numerous third-party libraries implement bignums. The most popular one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> (GMP). It provides a C API but has bindings for all major languages.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bignum implementations. They're different in detail, but the general approach to implement bignums is the same. Today we'll see what this approach looks like and use CPython's implementation as a reference example. The two main questions we'll have to answer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to represent bignums; and</li>
<li>how to performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, on bignums.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also discuss how CPython's implementation compares to others and what CPython does to make integers more efficient. </p>
<h2>Bignum representation</h2>
<p>Think for a moment how you would represent large integers in your program if you were to implement them yourself. Probably the most obvious way to do that is to store an integer as a sequence of digits, just like we usually write down numbers. For example, the integer <code>51090942171709440000</code> could be represented as <code>[5, 1, 0, 9, 0, 9, 4, 2, 1, 7, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. This is essentially how bignums are represented in practice. The only important difference is that instead of base 10, much larger bases are used. For example, CPython uses base 2^15 or base 2^30 depending on the platform. What's wrong with base 10? If we represent each digit in a sequence with a single byte but use only 10 out of 256 possible values, it would be very memory-inefficient. We could solve this memory-efficiency problem if we use base 256, so that each digit takes a value between 0 and 255. But still much larger bases are used in practice. The reason for that is because larger base means that numbers have less digits, and the less digits numbers have, the faster arithmetic operations are performed. The base cannot be arbitrary large. It's typically limited by the size of the integers that the CPU can work with. We'll see why this is the case when we discuss bignum arithmetic in the next section. Now let's take a look at how CPython represents bignums.</p>
<p>Everything related to the representation of Python integers can be found in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longintrepr.h"><code>Include/longintrepr.h</code></a>. Technically, Python integers are instances of <code>PyLongObject</code>, which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longobject.h"><code>Include/longobject.h</code></a>, but <code>PyLongObject</code> is actually a typedef for <code>struct _longobject</code> that is defined in <code>Include/longintrepr.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>_longobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>digit</span> <span>ob_digit</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This struct extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyVarObject"><code>PyVarObject</code></a>, which in turn extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject"><code>PyObject</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, besides a reference count and a type that all Python objects have, an integer object has two other members: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>ob_size</code> that comes from <code>PyVarObject</code>; and </li>
<li><code>ob_digit</code> that is defined in <code>struct _longobject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ob_digit</code> member is a pointer to an array of digits. On 64-bit platforms, each digit is a 30-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^30-1 and is stored as an unsigned 32-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>uint32_t</code>). On 32-bit platforms, each digit is a 15-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^15-1 and is stored as an unsigned 16-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>unsigned short</code>). To make things concrete, in this post we'll assume that digits are 30 bits long.</p>
<p>The <code>ob_size</code> member is a signed int, whose absolute value tells us the number of digits in the <code>ob_digit</code> array. The sign of <code>ob_size</code> indicates the sign of the integer. Negative <code>ob_size</code> means that the integer is negative. If <code>ob_size</code> is 0, then the integer is 0.</p>
<p>Digits are stored in a little-endian order. The first digit (<code>ob_digit[0]</code>) is the least significant, and the last digit (<code>ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1]</code>) is the most significant.</p>
<p>Finally, the absolute value of an integer is calculated as follows: </p>
<p>$$val = ob\_digit[0] \times (2 ^{30})^0 + ob\_digit[1] \times (2 ^{30})^1 + \cdots + ob\_digit[|ob\_size| - 1] \times (2 ^{30})^{|ob\_size| - 1}$$</p>
<p>Let's see what all of this means with an example. Suppose we have an integer object that has <code>ob_digit = [3, 5, 1]</code> and <code>ob_size = -3</code>. To compute its value, we can do the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ python -q</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>base</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>30</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>-1152921509975556099</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let's do the reverse. Suppose we want to get the bignum representation of the number <code>51090942171709440000</code>. Here's how we can do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>51090942171709440000</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>952369152</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>337507546</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>44</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, <code>ob_digit = [952369152, 337507546, 44]</code> and <code>ob_size = 3</code>. Actually, we don't even have to compute the digits, we can get them by inspecting the integer object using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes"><code>ctypes</code></a> standard library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>ctypes</span>

<p>As you might guess, the representation of bignums is an easy part. The main challenge is to implement arithmetic operations and to implement them efficiently.</p>
<h2>Bignum arithmetic</h2>
<p>We learned in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">part 6</a> that the behavior of a Python object is determined by the object's type. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. So, to understand how CPython performs arithmetic operations on integers, we need to study the slots of the <code>int</code> type that implement those operations.</p>
<p>In the C code, the <code>int</code> type is called <code>PyLong_Type</code>. It's defined in <code>Objects/longobject.c</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>PyLong_Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>PyType_Type</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="introduction"><a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction</h3>
<p>The question of whether or not the worldview and practice—for <i>practice</i> it intentionally is—going variously by the names “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-social-justice/">Social Justice</a>,” “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/02/naming-enemy-critical-social-justice/">Critical Social Justice</a>,” or, more colloquially, “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-woke-wokeness/">Woke</a>” constitutes a religion is one of some general interest that seems to be growing. Until quite recently, we maintained the luxury of not having to treat the matter more deeply than as something of a curio of sociocultural philosophy, however important the issue may be. I have contended, for example, that Critical Social Justice constitutes a religion of sorts (a <i>postmodern one</i>, as I <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/06/postmodern-religion-faith-social-justice/">laid it out</a> at considerable length; a nominally “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-antiracism/"><i>anti-racist</i></a>” one, as Columbia University professor John McWhorter is <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/antiracism-our-flawed-new-religion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackling</a> it currently, at book length) and must be thought of as such, at least by everyday citizens—though not by the law. Those were simpler times.</p>
<p>Now things are quite different and much more serious, so a much more serious inquiry is demanded of us. This escalation arrives not so much due to the externally obvious reasons like how profoundly parallel to religion Critical Social Justice and its practice have become—literally washing black people’s feet in the streets through tearful apologies against whiteness—but more because of its rapid and seemingly unstoppable penetration into our public institutions, including government at every level and, more importantly, our public schools.</p>
<p>It is nearly always a question of considerable importance and some urgency when an ideology, especially when it comprises a totalizing worldview, decides that it is to be the fundamental basis for how we organize society and educate our children, to say nothing of other legal concerns. This, to be certain, is happening now with astonishing rapidity. The overwhelming majority of our schools systems’ teacher training over the summer of 2020, to prepare teachers for the new mostly-online educational demands for the coming fall term, have been heavily, if not exclusively, about issues pertinent to Critical Social Justice. Our government agencies at all levels are taking on the basic principles and tenets of this belief system as matters of both policy and recommendation.</p>
<p>With astonishing speed, a shocking number of our nation’s school systems have taken up explicitly <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/">critical</a>—as in <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-theory/">Critical Theory</a>—<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-pedagogy/">educational approaches</a> that focus on teaching <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-identity-politics/">identity politics</a>, “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-antiracism/">anti-racism</a>,” and about the <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-power-systemic/">systems of power</a> that the Critical Social Justice worldview <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/01/influence-anti-racist-scholarship-activism-evergreen-college/">assumes</a> exists in everything. States like <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/free-feminine-hygiene-products-in-schools-early-ethnic-studies-on-washington-state-legislative-wish-list-for-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington</a>, <a href="https://edsource.org/2020/new-draft-ethnic-studies-curriculum-for-california-students-issued-after-a-year-of-study/637506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a>, and <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/culturally-responsive-sustaining-education-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York</a> are openly adopting “Ethnic Studies” programs that revamp their entire educational systems in line with Critical Social Justice so extreme that they seek to replace math with “<a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2019/10/11/seattle-schools-lead-controversial-push-to-rehumanize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethnomathematics</a>” and history with critical “hxstory.” These changes come alongside other equally questionable practices with even more jargon-heavy descriptions, all dedicated to awakening a “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-consciousness/">critical consciousness</a>” of “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-antiracism/">anti-racism</a>” through “cultural awareness” in our nation’s children. Our curricula, we’re told, have to be “<a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s12129-020-09899-2?sharing_token=QkTk_96aBmLzTIpYfqE8ofe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5ccP1G-tw-JzDXMsIXpR0f0Y4rNLFgSAa0KYeeP1aaFVQ8HMjWnRTD0mHYY1gOKUcbE09-xzMpT4tlJ5mtTAbjIkhtAiPpw166JZGnapIh1paO0lxQItuZwe2Pq9L2OSk%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decolonized</a>.” New curricula are explicitly based not only in <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-theory/">Critical Theories</a> of <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-identity-politics/">identity</a>, but upon the critical historiography of the infamously <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/07/history-killers-academic-fraudulence-1619-project/">revisionist</a> (and Pulitzer Prize-winning) <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-1619-project/">1619 Project</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1LGslwJwhXvpVnDgw0uC-n794l6EGzpuH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explicit dictates</a> of the radical Black-power activism organization <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Lives Matter</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a veritable war is going on regarding whether or not assessment (like standardized testing) is “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-racism-systemic/">racist</a>,” and excellence programs are being scrapped for being “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-equity/">inequitable</a>.” As parents react to this (often very negatively) by seeking to pull their kids out of our public schools in favor of homeschooling them, calls to abolish homeschooling are coming to the fore of the discussion from the priestly of this new faith, insisting that it is “racist” to teach one’s own children at home because the state has a duty to teach them subjects like “Social Justice.” These changes should facilitate the elimination of objective standards that will enable an increase in the ability to execute and hide rampant problems of applying discriminatory admissions policies at elite schools and universities, all in the name of “equity,” which people are led to believe is a hallmark of<i> group </i>fairness.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, many of our government agencies and departments are taking on the tenets of Critical Social Justice, especially Critical Race Theory and its derivative, “anti-racism,” as a matter of mandate. These entities include state and federal “departments of” as well as myriad government contractors and state funded entities, like National Public Radio (NPR). Even NASA, which is widely regarded as synonymous with scientific rigor, hosted “anti-racist” historian Ibram X. Kendi to <a href="https://disrn.com/news/nasa-asks-far-left-antiracism-professor-ibram-x-kendi-to-speak-to-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lecture</a> its employees on tenets of this Theoretical view of the world. This invitation is remarkable given that Kendi’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/how-to-fix-politics-in-america/inequality/pass-an-anti-racist-constitutional-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explicit ambition</a> is to pass an “anti-racist” Constitutional amendment that would permanently create and empower a <i>de facto</i> fourth branch of the American government dedicated to <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/">critically</a> examining and unmaking any “racist” policy, defined as anything that ends up having certain (but not other) disparate outcomes by race. This invitation is even less alarming than the fact that Kendi’s argument is being used in support of a California initiative to remove the anti-discrimination language from its state constitution in accordance with achieving equity and “anti-racism.” Equally, if not more alarming, are that the Center for Disease Control has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">institutionalized</a> tremendous <span>quantities</span> of this Theory (during a pandemic, no less), even while states officially declare “systemic racism” a kind of “public health crisis” that obviates any reasonable measures for pandemic mitigation if done in the name of “racial justice.” Even large government contractors, like Sandia Laboratories, which handles extremely high-tech weaponry (including nuclear weaponry), have taken on this ideology deeply enough to have fallen into an internal “<a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1299008750729097216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">civil war</a>” after a brave employee blew the whistle.</p>
<p>The matter of understanding Critical Social Justice, as the ideology is formally called, is, in some sense, no longer a mere philosophical issue (if it ever truly was). It’s now an emergency, and as more and more people are noticing (or, it seems, hoping, as it would provide them with recourse that currently seems not to exist), it’s likely to be a <i>legal</i> emergency. Unfortunately, very little legal architecture currently exists to do anything about the problem of this imposition of one particular belief system upon society via its most susceptible demographic—children. Further, perhaps due to failures of people like myself in the past few years, there has been very little push to generate this legal architecture in what is likely to be one of its strongest and most fruitful directions: identifying the Critical Social Justice worldview as a <i>functionally religious</i> worldview. This is required to open it up to the full machinery of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and its famous Establishment Clause, and would, at least, get it out of our school systems very quickly.</p>
<p>The argument, I think, needs to be opened up in earnest because we now face two incredible perils against the American ideal where it collides with the Critical Social Justice worldview, and these merit taking the issue and the risk that comes with it (legally<i> protecting</i> Critical Social Justice as a system of faith)<i> </i>very seriously. The first of these is the one I’ve already spent some time on pointing out: Critical Social Justice has already encroached deeply into our public education system and halls of government in the United States. In fact, this trend is accelerating to a pitch so extreme that complaints that schools are operating in the service of political indoctrination rather than as houses of a basic and liberal education, as they were initially conceived, are rapidly becoming plausible. The second is that a time may come in the not-distant future in which this totalizing and totalitarian worldview could be installed as the de facto state religion, even while it elides categorization as such. The state endorsement—or worse, enforcement—of any faith falls directly afoul of the protections the U.S. Constitution was written to ensure to individual citizens, and, in fact, to other systems of faith that would disagree with it. The question is, which totalizing worldviews that are not traditionally recognizable as faiths should be treated in the same way for the same reasons? While the answer to this question is not immediately clear, it must have to do with how they function in society and in the lives of those who believe them.</p>
<p>Therefore, to put it directly: It is my belief that the contents of the Critical Social Justice worldview should be protected as matters of private conscience only, and they …</p></section></div></div></div>

<p>"Permanent Record," Edward Snowden's 2019 memoir, was just what I'd hoped for: a record of a personal journey, recounted in service to a thoughtful, nuanced argument for civil disobedience and acts of conscience.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/09/24/permanent-record-edward-snowden-and-the-making-of-a-whistleblower/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/09/24/permanent-record-edward-snowden-and-the-making-of-a-whistleblower/</a></p>
<p>Whistleblowers are often complicated figures. Often, a whistleblower acts out of mixed motivations – personal grievance, trauma, anger. Sometimes they're incoherent and struggle to frame their deeds.</p>
<p>Not Snowden.</p>
<p>As Permanent Record makes clear, he acted out of principle, after lengthy soul-searching, because he believed in his country and was both elated at the liberatory power of tech and terrified by its power to oppress.</p>
<p>On top of that, Permanent Record is a beautifully written, gripping technothriller, a procedural that explains the nuts and bolts of encryption, operational security, both fascinating and revelatory, a guide to what you should be worried about, and what you can do about it.</p>
<p>But Permanent Record keeps getting better! Today, Henry Holt released "Permanent Record: Young Readers Edition," which is exactly what it sounds like, a young adult version of Snowden's memoir, laying out his life's story and his principles for teens.</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250767929/">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250767929/</a></p>
<p>Speaking as someone who grew up on the kind of Heinlein "juvie" that read like a super cool older brother who put his arm around your shoulder and said, "Look, kid, I'm going to tell you how the world works" —</p>
<p>Speaking as a writer who tried to capture that same spirit with my own book Little Brother – a book whose working title was "Wikipedia Brown," and which I pitched as "Howard Zinn meets Have Spacesuit Will Travel" —</p>
<p>Speaking as the father of an adolescent —</p>
<p>This is an amazing book.</p>
<p>Snowden's sprightly prose, his deep technical knowledge, his superb knack for explaining complex matters, his ability to articulate principled action all come together in a book that is, if anything, <em>better</em> than the adult version.</p>
<p>Books for teens cast a long shadow. They can alter the course of a person's life. I was permanently affected by the books I read as an adolescent. Snowden isn't just simplifying his message for kids here.</p>
<p>He's engaging with a generation of people who will never know a life without the internet, but who might someday know a life free from ubiquitous surveillance.</p>
<p>Tonight at 7PM Pacific I'm helping Snowden launch the book in a livestreamed event in collaboration with Copperfield Books:</p>

<p>When you think of online tracking, chances are you think about third-party cookies that follow you from site to site. Third-party cookie handling has been a hot-button issue among the major browser vendors of late, with Google announcing that Chrome would deprecate them.</p>
<p>But third-party cookies are just the most obvious way that your online activity gets tracked. Far more insidious is "browser fingerprinting," in which the unique characteristics of your browser and computer are linked to your identity and tracked.</p>
<p>Browser fingerprinting and other de-anonymizing attacks are a reminder that the technical problems of anonymity are subtle and complex, which is generally true of all privacy questions.</p>
<p>It's also a reminder that privacy problems can't be solved with code alone: to be private, you also need legal recourse against companies that cheat and spy on you.</p>
<p>Finally, it's a reminder that we need independent security researchers, who can warn us about novel ways of attacking our digital privacy.</p>
<p>Researchers like Jonas Strehle, who just published a fascinating proof-of-concept demonstrating how favicons (the tiny icons in your browser tabs) represent a serious privacy vulnerability.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jonasstrehle/supercookie">https://github.com/jonasstrehle/supercookie</a></p>
<p>Strehle calls this tracking-by-favicon "supercookies," and his demo shows that these trackers defeat incognito mode, VPNs, and ad-blockers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v5y7/browser-favicons-can-be-used-as-undeletable-supercookies-to-track-you-online">https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v5y7/browser-favicons-can-be-used-as-undeletable-supercookies-to-track-you-online</a></p>
<p>His work builds on an academic U Illinois Chicago paper from Network and Distributed Systems Security, published in 2020: "Tales of FAVICONS and Caches:Persistent Tracking in Modern Browsers"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~polakis/papers/solomos-ndss21.pdf">https://www.cs.uic.edu/~polakis/papers/solomos-ndss21.pdf</a></p>
<p>Favicons are stored locally in a database called the F-cache; if a user requests a favicon from a site, the site can infer that the user has never visited the site before (or that the gap since their last visit was so long that the cache expired).</p>
<p>"By combining the state of delivered and not delivered favicons for specific URL paths for a browser, a unique pattern (identification number) can be assigned to the client. When the website is reloaded, the web server can reconstruct the identification number with the network requests sent by the client for the missing favicons and thus identify the browser."</p>
<p>This confirms the original paper's theoretical prediction that favicon attacks "allow a website  to reconstruct a 32-bit tracking identifier in 2 seconds."</p>

<p>For people and businesses, money is scarce; for currency-issuing governments, it's not. The story that governments "spend our taxes" is obviously wrong: since governments are the <em>source</em> of money, it can't be right that governments have to get money from us before they spend.</p>
<p>Governments spend first, spending money into existence. Then they tax, which annihilates some of that money. If governments run "balanced budgets" (where they tax as much as they spend), they leave no money left over for us to use.</p>
<p>And if they run a surplus (taxing more than they spend), then they reduce the supply of money that's available for the private sector to spend. The government's deficit is the public's credit, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Government spending is constrained…but not by money. It's constrained by <em>resources</em>. If the government creates money to buy more things than are for sale – or things that the private sector's also trying to buy – prices go up (AKA inflation).</p>
<p>There's a lot of important stuff for sale in any given government's currency that no one else is trying to buy, though: for example, the labor of unemployed people. Governments can safely create money to buy that labor at a socially inclusive wage with good benefits.</p>
<p>Sometimes, governments need to buy things the private sector also wants. During WWII, states needed raw material, processing facilities, and labor for the war.</p>
<p>To prevent inflation, they did two things: first, they rationed, limiting what the private sector could buy.</p>
<p>Second, they created "war bonds," which were basically sinkholes for money. By urging workers to sequester the money they earned in war production, governments were able to take the money out of circulation during the period when there was nothing to buy with it.</p>
<p>Governments that recognize this undeniable truth – money is spent into existence, taxed out of existence – are able to weather crises, for example, by spending whatever it takes to get through a pandemic, or to recover from a crash.</p>
<p>Governments that allow themselves to be constrained by the fiction of "spending tax money" are hobbled during crises – locked into austerity at the moment when the economy contracts, drawing down the pool of spendable money when spending is desperately needed.</p>
<p>And even if a government is free from the ideological straitjacket of scarce money, it can still be hampered by external factors. For example, if a government owes debts in a currency it doesn't issue, then it can't spend its way out of debt.</p>
<p>Venezuela and Zimbabwe could create VEBs and ZWDs all day and it wouldn't give them the dollars they needed to service their debts – and since they'd oriented their economies towards import rather than self-reliance, there wasn't much they could buy in VEBs and ZWDs either.</p>
<p>It's not just debt: governments can cede their monetary sovereignty by pegging their currency to some other currency (like the USD), or by allowing a third party to issue their currency (like the eurozone nations).</p>
<p>The eurozone is a remarkable phenomenon: a union of 19 affluent countries that have abandoned control of their money and thus their ability to fund things like a job guarantee, putting themselves at the mercy of the European Central Bank during economic crises.</p>
<p>During the 2008 crisis, the ECB put the screws to the eurozone, punishing austerity and a wildly uneven recovery with riches for the financial sector (who were able to charge interest on loans that replaced state spending) and destruction for the real economy and the 99%.</p>
<p>It's grimly ironic. The ECB – which is largely controlled by German politicians – is repeating the mistakes of the German central bank in the runup to WWII. You've probably heard the stories of Weimar hyperinflation, but that's not what triggered the German depression.</p>
<p>Rather, it was Brüning's 1930 policy of <em>deflation</em> – removing money from the economy through austerity – that triggered and then worsened the economic crisis in Germany, creating the conditions for societal collapse, fascism, and imperialist aggression.</p>
<p>Well, there's another economic crisis in the offing – the pandemic – and yet another, far worse one on the horizon – the climate emergency. And even with the constraints the ECB and eurozone nations have imposed on themselves, there is still room to get it …</p></div></article></div>

																										<p><span>Recently published </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2020.1871169"><span>research</span></a><span> found that when actor Tom Hanks announced his COVID-19 diagnosis on March 11, 2020, it likely had a significant effect on the public’s attitude toward the deadly pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A day after Hanks </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tomhanks/status/1237909897020207104?s=20"><span>announced</span></a><span> on social media that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the Coronavirus, Dr. Jessica Myrick of Penn State University and Dr. Jessica Willoughby of Washington State University surveyed 682 people about their attitudes and behaviors toward COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The pair of researchers say 83% of persons surveyed had heard of Hanks’ diagnosis, and approximately half of that group said the news had changed their attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19. Results of the study were published in the </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2020.1871169"><span>journal of Health Communication</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“There is a growing body of research about how celebrity behavior and social media posts can affect public health,” said Dr. Myrick in a </span><a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/646649/2021/02/04/research/tom-hanks-covid-19-diagnosis-likely-shaped-behaviors-thoughts"><span>statement </span></a><span>issued by Penn State. “This suggests that public health officials and advocates may want to use these types of celebrity announcements to help reach people who may be harder to reach.”</span></p>

Live, Los Angeles. (Image Source: Stock image)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Staring in a slew of blockbuster movies, such as <em>Forrest Gump</em>, <em>Toy Story</em>,<em> Saving Private Ryan</em>, and <em>Captain Phillips</em>, Hanks is one of the world’s most popular and well-known film stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>News of Hanks coming down with COVID last spring was further spread when a photo showing Hanks, apparently in a hospital room, holding a volleyball identical to the ball his character befriends and names Wilson in the 2000 film <em>Cast Away</em> went viral online. A caption accompanying the image claimed hospital staff had given Hanks the volleyball to keep him company during his quarantine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed a heartwarming story, Hanks’ photo holding the volleyball was a </span><a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doctored-image-contains-2015-photo-tom-hanks-and-ball-movie-cast-away"><span>doctored image</span></a><span>, and the story was false. The account had initially appeared on the satire news site, </span><a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doctored-image-contains-2015-photo-tom-hanks-and-ball-movie-cast-away"><span>The Betoota Advocate</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Nevertheless, the fake viral story further spread the news of Hanks’ diagnosis, which researchers say “highlighted the reality of COVID-19” during the early days when much of the public was still learning about the virus and its severity. Because of Hanks’ announcement, many began to consider their own susceptibility to COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This [Hanks disclosure] just makes me a little worried now. Anyone, no matter who you are, can catch the virus and not even know it. Makes me take all the precautions that I possibly can to prevent myself and family from getting the virus,” said one of the respondents to the study.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Researchers say many survey participants reported being inspired to learn more about COVID-19 and/or take stricter precautions thanks to Hanks’ disclosure. “I am more alert and interested in the issue of coronavirus than I was before Tom Hanks disclosed that he had it,” reported a participant. Another said, “My thoughts have changed. Hearing this news about Tom Hanks makes me think that the virus is more serious.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many expressed a range of emotions to the news of Hanks’ illness, including surprise, fear, anger, sadness, and hope. “I just feel an increase in fear and worry. I think humans are stupid and might give me the disease, this makes me angry,” reported a participant. “I am worried about the coronavirus hitting close to home. Knowing a celebrity has gotten sick with this virus makes me more worried that myself or my family might catch it,” said another.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the half of respondents not influenced by Hanks’ diagnosis, the majority reported thinking the illness did not pose any severe health concerns to the actor. Researchers also noted that many in the “not influenced” category said they were already aware of COVID-19 and its effects before Hanks’ announcement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With persons reporting they had not heard about Hanks’ diagnosis, researchers showed half of these participants the Facebook post where Hanks announced he’d tested positive for COVID-19 and the other half a non-COVID post made by Hanks. Researchers say the group who read the COVID-19 post reported feeling less capable of avoiding the virus than those who had read the non-COVID post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It could be that learning of Hanks’ diagnosis, despite his wealth and resources, resulted in people thinking that if Hanks could not avoid COVID-19, then they may not be able to, either,” theorized researchers.</span></p>
<p><span>A wealth of </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2666148"><span>empirical research</span></a><span> has demonstrated the significant impact celebrity endorsement can have on consumer buying behavior. A 2017 </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=40853"><span>study </span></a><span>by Harvard Business School professor Dr. Anita Elberse and Barclays Capital analyst Jeroen Verleun found that, on average, a celebrity endorsement increased a company’s sales by 4% relative to its competition and increased stock value by 0.25%. While this may not seem like a lot, 4% can translate into billions of dollars for major corporations.&nbsp;</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-50201" data-id="50201"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span>Researchers say their study showing the impact of Hanks’ COVID-19 diagnosis on public perception demonstrates that celebrities can be equally powerful voices during public health crises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Statistical analysis performed by researchers showed that celebrity influence could be especially pervasive during a health crisis whenever it involves a famous personality people feel they can identify with. “Tom Hanks is the guy we feel we like and know, so hearing about him is closer to finding out that a friend or a family member has it,” said one participant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“People who said they typically trust celebrities, friends, family, or Donald Trump for health information were more likely to say that Hanks’ announcement led to positive behavior change,” said Dr. Myrick. “This suggests that public health officials and advocates may want to use these types of celebrity announcements to help reach people who may be harder to reach. They don’t rely as much on news or on scientists for health information.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Researchers note their findings suggest not everyone will respond uniformly to illness announcements made by celebrities, and some may feel disempowered by the news that a beloved public figure cannot protect themselves from illness.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Public health organizations may need to focus on creating messages that boost public efficacy if a beloved celebrity is struggling with an illness. Conversely, once a celebrity like Hanks recovers, additional campaign messages may want to point to that recovery to generate hope and stronger efficacy perceptions,” note researchers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following his recovery, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/tom-hanks-on-surviving-coronavirus-i-had-crippling-body-aches-fatigue-and-couldnt-concentrate"><span>Hanks has said</span></a><span> he experienced “crippling body aches,” fatigue, and the inability to “concentrate on anything for more than 12 minutes” during his bout with COVID-19. Hanks says his wife, Rita Wilson, lost her sense of taste and smell, had severe nausea, and a high-fever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not wanting to see anyone else go through the unpleasant, in some cases fatal, experience, Hanks encourages people to follow prevention guidelines issued by health professionals. “There’s really only three things everyone needs to do: wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands. I know societally it’s been politicized, but I don’t get it, man. I don’t understand how anyone can put their foot down and say: ‘I don’t have to do my part.'”</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><em>Hey, Nathan here! Remember a few months ago when we published a wonderful essay on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://every.to/divinations/linkedins-alternate-universe-21780381" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedInâ€™s ridiculousness</em></a><em>? It was one of Divinations most popular posts ever, and it was written by </em><a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fadeke Adegbuyi</em></a><em>, a brilliant observer of internet culture who also is a senior marketing manager at Doist. Today Iâ€™m thrilled to share with you Fadekeâ€™s latest workâ€”this time examining our obsession with identity through the lens of a Twitter bio tracking app called Spoonbill. Enjoy!</em></p><hr><p>Elon Musk updated his Twitter bio 23 times in 2020. He last changed it on February 4, 2021 at 6:31 AM PST. A few versions include â€œBorn 69 days after 4/20,â€� â€œSoundCloud Rockstar,â€� â€œBudgie Smuggler,â€� and â€œ#bitcoin.â€� I didnâ€™t spend months stalking Muskâ€™s page, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of his time spent in the Twitterverse. I looked it up on <a href="http://spoonbill.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spoonbill</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png"></a></p><p>I could use the app to give you similar information on any celebrity or public figure with a Twitter account. Or I could use it on you. If I wanted to, I could see all the changes youâ€™ve made to your profile since you first signed up: your name, your location, your website, your pinned tweets. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinmduke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin M. Duke</a>, describes the app, which has nearly 93 thousand users, as a â€œtracking tool for online metadata.â€� Over 45K of those users have signed up to receive daily emails that aggregate updates across all the Twitter profiles they follow. The open rate for these daily emails hovers around 55%, <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well above average</a> for email campaigns.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png"></a></p><p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hunter Walk</a>, a Partner at the seed-stage venture capital firm Homebrew and an avid Spoonbiller, why he uses the app :</p><blockquote><em>"It's fun to see people wordsmithing their bios, changing the order of the portfolio companies they list based on startup performance, subtly announcing personal life changes...Instead of letting Twitter decide what's worthy of notification, I get to see </em>every<em> change and decide for myself what's interesting, often with context that the algorithm is unaware of."</em></blockquote><p>The tracked changes that Twitterâ€™s algorithm might register as neutral additions and subtractions can indeed be revealing to onlookers. Spoonbill captures what the people we follow are changing their bios to express; an investment exit, a tongue-in-cheek joke, or the end of an internet cult affiliation.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png"></a></p><p>Social apps have made creepers out of all of us. Whether itâ€™s scrolling to the start of someoneâ€™s Instagram feed or <a href="https://sarajbenincasa.medium.com/confessions-of-a-venmo-voyeur-cb0e4c23d04a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">looking through Venmo transactions</a>, weâ€™re constantly peering into othersâ€™ online lives. Spoonbill not only satisfies our tendency for online lurking, but pushes it into voyeur territory; surfacing whatâ€™s meant to be hidden is intimate in a way that scrolling a timeline isnâ€™t. The tool provides a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, the unseen effort with which we express our identities, and how the uncanny feeling of being watched informs our sense of self.</p><p>Twitter is an interesting observation ground for online identity. Snapshots at Big Sur are meant for Instagramâ€™s photogenic feed, while professional milestones belong on <a href="https://divinations.every.to/p/linkedins-alternate-universe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedInâ€™s alternate universe</a>. But in the Twitterverse, life and work converge. People are just as likely to share career news as they are to live-tweet a Netflix binge; professional gripes commingle with criticism of political leaders; snark and sincerity live side-by-side. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png"></a></p><p>Twitterâ€™s bio section, then, is a tall order: <em>compress your entire identity into a single line item</em>. Many use the space to convey their own complexityâ€“â€“smart yet funny, accomplished but approachable. Society has progressed past the need for the phrase â€œworks hard, plays hard,â€� but thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to convey in our own personalized way: we contain multitudes. We are real.</p><p>Spoonbill reveals the way that people play with their latest positioning of self, carving out character space for their newly important aspects of identity.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png"></a></p><p>Hustle culture looms large and professional accomplishments convey worth. In turn, notable work, career highlights, and impressive affiliations take center stage in our Twitter bios, the structure and grammar of which are heavily coded. Freelance journalists add and shuffle their bylines, arranged in order of prestige â€“â€“ @nytimes is meant to come first. In my corner of Tech Twitter, where optionality is king, itâ€™s now effectively a meme to be <em>â€œstarting something new,â€�</em> marked increasingly by the addition of â€œSubstack:â€�, â€œScout:â€�, or â€œSide project:â€� to oneâ€™s bio. Users adding â€œ<em>permanent student</em>â€� or â€œ<em>forever learning</em>â€� to their bios arenâ€™t pupils at cruel and unusual institutions, theyâ€™re signalling intellectual curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png"></a></p><p>The ability to see Twitter bio updates across hundreds or thousands of profiles over time make Spoonbill updates insightful in aggregate. Certain patterns and conventions emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator has observed interesting trends in his app:</p><blockquote><em>"On an individual/corporate basis, a particularly fun one is seeing angels and investors tinker with the parts of the portfolio they </em><a href="http://spoonbill.io/twitter/data/Jason/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>choose to highlight</em></a><em>. A very classic example of this was the sheer number of firms and investors who removed things mentioning WeWork during, well, the period of time that you didnâ€™t want your name associated with WeWork."</em></blockquote><p>WeWork reached a $47 billion valuation in 2019, but cancelled their plans to go public <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-ipo-timeline-delayed-ceo-adam-neumann-scandals-explained-2019-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after their IPO filing drew questions and concerns</a>. In a bio block thatâ€™s meant for selling ourselves to a potential follower, a failed investment takes up valuable real estate. But while WeWork investors might wish we would all forget their involvement as quickly as they hit â€œsaveâ€� on their new bio, Spoonbill always knows.</p><p>In that same 160-character space, weâ€™re also meant to declare our commitment to cause: political, social, or economic. Often, emojis will do:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png"></a></p><p>If you watch Spoonbill updates closely enough, they suggest that the labels and descriptors we choose to signal our allegiances can be fleeting, our attention spans short. As COVID-19 spread throughout the world in early 2020, many updated their bios with their own messages about the virus, encouraging their followers to take some form of action:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png"></a></p><p>But almost as quickly as these bio changes were made, they were unmade, individuals returning to their regular profiles. Less charitably, people just got bored; short-term vigilance surrounding the virus eventually led to a return to normal life for many. More charitably, the longer the pandemic wore on, identities once swaddled in concern for the virus eventually needed some wiggle room.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, as racial tensions bubbled to a boil throughout the United States and set off an international cascade, Spoonbill revealed how Twitter bios were used to show support for what was top of mindâ€“â€“or a stance on what was top of the fold:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png"></a></p><p>As time went on, it was jarring but predictable to see lines through phrases like â€œBlack lives matterâ€� across swaths of profile updates in my inbox. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png"></a></p><p>Politics similarly finds its way into our descriptions of self. With the 2020 U.S. presidential election, many translated their desired vote on the ballot to their bio: </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png"></a></p><p>The story has already been written, and you know what comes next: dashed presidential dreams translated to crossed-out candidates. Adding presidential hopefuls or even political parties to how we identify can be an exercise in disappointment. Disappointment is inevitable (after all, there can only be one). But seeing how long people hold on to their hopefuls was interesting; some still signalling long after their candidate had dropped out.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png"></a></p><p>These tracked changes of our online selves provide a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, how society manages to infect our identities, and, what we valueâ€”or what we want to be seen as valuing.</p><p>Spoonbill uncovers the tacit labor involved in our quest for the perfect personal positioning. In describing the way online influencers take effortless-looking selfies that are actually quite effortful, <a href="https://twitter.com/wishcrys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Crystal Abidin (aka wishcrys)</a>, a researcher and â€œanthropologist of influencer culturesâ€� (according to her own Twitter bio), <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305116641342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coined the term â€œtacit laborâ€�</a> as:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>â€œA collective practice of work that is understated and under-visibilized from being so thoroughly rehearsed that it appears as effortless and subconscious.â€�</em></blockquote><p>You donâ€™t need to be an influencer to know the labor involved in taking and selecting a selfie. Getting the right light, angle, and expression are just some of the considerations made while snapping and choosing from the photos that fill our camera rolls. After selecting the winning shot, we leave behind a stream of rejected selfies, never to see the light of day; the tacit labor stays hidden. After a photo has been cropped, filtered, and face-tuned, a refined â€œselfâ€�-ie joins the feed, adding to our curated online imageâ€“â€“polished, carefree, or somewhere in between.</p><p>Just like we strain for the perfect selfie, we tinker to find the perfect bio, treating it as a personal sales pitch and making micro edits to what we represent and â€œwho we are.â€� Spoonbill catalogues every time-stamped keystroke and tracked changeâ€“â€“from the removal of a single stuffy period to self-consciously swapping â€œMarketerâ€� for â€œStorytellerâ€� and reverting back again.&nbsp; Like the photos in your camera roll, your current Twitter bio has leftâ€“â€“for Spoonbill users to seeâ€“â€“a wake of rejected selves. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbill reveals the surprising scale and frenzying frequency with which all kinds of people make these online edits. We add in emojis, expand and shrink our past affiliations, and flirt briefly with humor, adding clever one-liners before eventually reverting to something more serious. Itâ€™s effortfulness on display. Seeing people iterate on their identities in Spoonbill, switching too-formal uppercase for carefree lowercase characters, makes our desire to control how …</p></div></div>

					<p>Having good internet is really important to me, but I also want it as cheap as possible. I know that, especially where I live in New York, I can negotiate my bill. There are always promotions that can vastly bring the cost down, but as with many Americans, I often neglect trying to get a better deal once the initial set up is over. There’s some fear that I will have to switch providers, which will be a pain (I certainly don’t want to be out of internet for any amount of time). But one of the biggest reasons I never negotiate my internet bill is that I hate talking on the phone. I don’t like having to listen to the gravelly voice while holding something up to my ear and having to pay full attention the whole time. With <a href="https://www.voyxt.com/">Voyxt</a>, I was able to call my internet provider <a href="https://www.rcn.com/">RCN </a>from my computer (no literally picking up the phone) and using my keyboard to speak, and also saved ~$40/month on my bill with a simple 7 minute call (see the full call below or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBDIREk3GJ8&amp;feature=youtu.be">Youtube</a>)</p>

					<p>The big broadband corporations (ex.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://official.spectrum.com/">Spectrum</a>) that provide you internet and television (and, if you’re a bit old fashioned, maybe a landline) make it pretty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/business/so-easy-to-sign-up-and-so-hard-to-cancel.html">hard to cancel your subscription</a>. Even though many have some form of online webchat or email support, cancellation or price changes to your subscription are often only allowed through the phone or in person. Because there are only a few providers, they don’t feel the need to provide such services through online channels. They know that calling is harder and many people avoid customer service calls, so they can continue raising your prices even though their costs are much lower. I suspect they might even make the calls more difficult to navigate on purpose – making you waste your time talking to their machine while they are using automated code to put you on hold. However, calls to negotiate price are not uncommon, and it’s likely that many of the customer service representatives that answer your call are just following a script and can easily look up promotions to reduce your price. You simply have to ask.,</p>

					<p>I knew that I should be able to get a better price, but I still wanted to be respectful and prepare some conversation points for my chat with RCN. I spent some time researching my options – I knew that Spectrum and Verizon both had deals in the new year for cheaper internet. It was easy to access their prices from their sites and spam letters they have been sending me (another problem!). I wrote out a few sentences that I might use so that I could communicate faster using Voyxt. I expected I could probably get about $20/month discount with my call so I was ready to cancel if I could not get the price down below $90/month total on my bill. I also prepared some research on purchasing my own modem and router (although this was a huge annoyance because it is almost impossible to determine which modems work for RCN). With these resources, I felt ready to make the call.</p>

					<div><p>First, I had to navigate RCN’s own customer service machine. Luckily, I was using Voyxt, so I could navigate it easily using Voyxt’s transcriptions and text to speech, using machine against machine. There was a long section discussion the COVID 19 pandemic which I could easily put out of my mind while I waited for useful information. Funnily, they suggested that I might have to wait 40 minutes before an agent talked to me (perhaps an unintentional way to get me to hang up?) but immediately connected me to a real agent, Jasmine. After all the transfers, the phone call had gotten jittery and some of the audio was garbled. However, Voyxt’s transcriptions kept working so I was able to easily navigate the conversation. After simply asking for a reduction in price (and being a bit patient), Jasmine was able to offer me internet at a greatly reduced price, saving me just under $40 per month. I didn’t have to use anything I prepared – I just had to ask. I believe that the customer service representatives are working hard to help out respectful customers, and with Voyxt it’s impossible to come off as upset or in the wrong way. After a brief chat, the call was over. There was a slight confusion in the call on the exact change in cost, but I checked my account online afterwards and it showed my next bill was as discussed and $40 per month cheaper than my previous month’s payment.</p><p>There are a lot of people trying to make customer service better, but in the end, the corporations are not incentivized to make it easy. The employees working there even want to help you out (they likely care little for their corporate overseers), but the way the companies have designed their customer service still means you have to call them and get to an agent. That’s why Voyxt was created – to give users the power and make phone calls easier. <a href="https://www.app.voyxt.com/register">Register for Voyxt now</a>.</p><p>See the full call I had with RCN below.&nbsp;<span>Start of chat with the agent at ~3 minutes</span></p></div>

          </p></div></section><section data-v-19ec50a8=""><article data-v-19ec50a8=""><p>The beta for the upcoming 5.21 release of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KWinFT projects</a> is now available.
It contains a monumental rewrite of KWinFT's windowing logic.
Read on for an overview of the changes and why this rewrite was necessary.</p>
<h2 id="a-confused-heart">A Confused Heart</h2>
<p>Let's define first what <em>windowing logic</em> is.
In my definition this means all structures and algorithms in code
to decide where a window should be stacked, placed, moved
or in which other ways its geometry can be manipulated
to allow the user to interact with and organize the totality of all windows.</p>
<p>And if you agree to such windowing logic
being of central importance for a windowing manager
and what distinguishes it in the end from others,
we may call it the <em>heart</em> of KWinFT.</p>
<p>The KWinFT compositor is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KWin</a>,
KDE's official compositor for the Plasma Workspace.
KWin was founded over two decades ago.
Necessarily some of its code is very old,
does not adhere to any modern development principles
and sometimes,
due to changes in other levels of the graphics stack,
it is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>It is kind of unexpected though,
that this has been in particular the case for the windowing logic,
the heart of KWinFT.
For example at the HEAD of KWin's current master branch
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blame/master/layers.cpp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">do a git-blame</a>
over the ludicrous code in <code>layers.cpp</code>
responsible for all window stacking
and count how many lines are older than a decade.</p>
<p>But old code is not necessarily bad.
The reason why this old code is bad, is two-fold:
for one under the leadership of the former maintainer
the Wayland support was shoehorned into an already complex code base
and secondly he followed a strategy
to keep the old code untouched as much as possible.
Instead of doing necessary incremental refactors to the old code,
he tried to firewall it with an abundance of tests.</p>
<p>For sure one can find reasons and excuses to pick such a strategy,
but ultimately one has to say it failed.
This can not be judged of course from the outside,
but I feel comfortable in making this assessment
as someone who knows the code in detail
and because I am not the only one who abandoned his strategy.</p>
<h2 id="who-does-the-work-is-not-always-right">Who Does the Work Is Not Always Right</h2>
<p>In fact I am not the first one to refactor the old windowing logic.
The current de facto maintainer of KWin, <a href="https://blog.vladzahorodnii.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vlad Zahorodnii</a>,
has done so in the past.</p>
<p>The result of his work were often massive merge requests
and back then,
when I was still contributing directly to KWin,
I had a feeling this was going into the wrong direction.
But I was also working on other upstream projects
and was in no position to tell someone,
who worked exclusively on KWin,
that his work should not go in as is.</p>
<p>This is actually enforced through an unwritten rule in KDE,
which prescribes that "the one who does the work, decides".
This sounds good when heard first,
but the one who does the work is not always right
and in the case of KWin,
Vlad's refactors made the old code even more complicated,
more fragile and less coherent.</p>
<h2 id="simple-is-difficult">Simple is Difficult</h2>
<p>The problem with Vlad's work on KWin is
that he likes to create solutions through the addition of new things.
He <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/656" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">still does</a>.</p>
<p>I call that the "easy way" to solve a problem in an existing code base:
You add new code, which you write against the problem you want to solve.
You ensure the new code does not break any of the old unit tests.
For compliance add another unit test for your new code.</p>
<p>The big downside of this approach is
that the complexity of the code increases every time you do it.
And KWin's windowing code has become absurdly complex over the years.
As an example
take a look at the different <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/toplevel.h#L299-349" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">types of geometries</a>,
which describe the position and size of a window.</p>
<p>In contrast I chose the hard way: I made the code simpler.</p>
<p>This would of course be also kind of easy if I just removed features,
but I was able to keep in all features of KWinFT's windowing logic
while simplifying major internal concepts and algorithms.</p>
<p>There is one exception though: the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html#idm45623492381424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shading of windows</a> got removed.
Sorry to the few people who used it,
but it is one of these features not meant for a Wayland world
and whoever had implemented it at some point in the ancient history of KWin,
had done that by littering special cases and boolean traps all over the code base
in order to get it done.</p>
<h2 id="battle-plans-and-front-lines">Battle Plans and Front Lines</h2>
<p>After this prelude let me give you an overview of what this revolution actually contains.</p>
<h3 id="flattening-the-hierarchy">Flattening the Hierarchy</h3>
<p>To get the revolution started I drafted in the beginning,
like I always do with bigger projects like this,
a general plan that I published in an <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/issues/75" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">issue ticket</a>.</p>
<p>You can see that my primary focus was to simplify the sprawling hierarchy of different window types,
which have grown in numbers over the years mostly because of the Wayland changes.</p>

<p>My first idea was to flatten the hierarchy through the use of C++ templates
and replacing <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/prefer-composition-over-inheritance-1602d5149ea1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">inheritance with composition</a>.
And while not yet fully finished,
the current state absolutely reaffirms my decision to follow through with this idea.</p>

<p>The classes <code>AbstractClient</code> and <code>XwaylandClient</code>,
which represented different kinds of windows,
have been removed completely.
This simplifies the hierarchy to only two levels.</p>
<p>In the future I want to also get rid of the <code>Toplevel</code> class.
My plan for that is to template the <code>Workspace</code> class over its supported window types.
This would mean no more dynamic inheritance at all.</p>
<p>Other dependent properties that were previously stuffed into <code>AbstractClient</code>
I carefully dissected out of it.
For example everything related to Scripting
is now contained in a single independent <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/blob/5409a4b98a79fdef463076b1c1b847d917cf3eb7/scripting/window_wrapper.h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">interface</a>.</p>
<h3 id="clean-code-is-comprehensible-code">Clean Code is Comprehensible Code</h3>
<p>While moving forward with my initial goals
I realized that huge parts of the code were so outdated, so ugly, so rotten,
that I could not just refactor the logic,
but also had to improve the code styling.
Often the internal logic was incomprehensible
because of the style.</p>
<p>So this project became also about replacing archaic macros with modern lambdas,
reducing code duplication, adding white space where it made sense and so on.</p>
<p>Overall I improved the readability and reduced clutter.
I ensured there is a single coherent style in all refactored files.
One of the largest single commits in that endeavor
was the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/commit/71926f30eb014ed2dfd0de715f16c01b93915d28?expanded=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">overhaul</a> of the <code>X11Client</code> class.</p>
<p>When deciding on how to clean up code,
I follow modern C++ principals in general.
I orientate myself at the Standard Library and the <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">C++ Core Guidelines</a>
instead of the outdated Qt library style.
This falls in line with my long-term plan to <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/issues/21" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">factor out libraries</a>
that will be pure C++ and not depend on Qt anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-ones-subsurfaces-and-window-geometries">The Big Ones: Subsurfaces and Window Geometries</h3>
<p>While my focus in the beginning of the windowing refactoring
was to simplify the hierarchy of windows,
that was not the initial motivation for this project.
My motivation was to fix a certain issue with Wayland subsurfaces:
they were not correctly transformed by effects.</p>
<p>There had landed <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D29131" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a patch</a> for that in KWin in the middle of last year,
but I had a feeling it was once again a half-baked attempt at a solution,
leading to more complexity instead of less and not solving the problem in a holistic way.
My further analysis of the patch confirmed my initial thoughts
and I decided to look at the problem from a completely different angle.</p>
<p>The solution I came up with I would in fact call <em>revolutionary</em>.
In the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/merge_requests/64" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Merge Request</a>
I described it as a "huge mental shift in what we understand under subsurfaces".
I reused existing concepts from X11 and Wayland,
but interpreted them in a new way,
what simplified the code
and unified the logic over all windows.</p>
<p>As there is much to say about this specific solution,
I split out the discussion of it into a follow-up article.
Stay tuned.</p>
<p>I will also write a separate article about the other big change:
a total redesign of how we store and change the geometries of windows.</p>
<p>These geometries were a pain point for me already for a long time.
Any aspiring new contributor for KWin must feel absolutely shell-shocked,
when trying to understand what all the different geometry types of windows are supposed to mean
and how they relate to each other.</p>
<p>As a reminder <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/toplevel.h#L299-349" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these</a> are just the getters
for the different kinds of geometries in the abstract top level interface class.
And <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/abstract_client.h#L624" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> is one of many ways to change a single one of them.
Yes, that's a pure virtual function in a subclass,
and yes, the second argument of that setter is a masked boolean trap.</p>
<p>To finally squash any hope that new contributor might have,
show him all the different forms on how to save a geometry
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/x11client.h#L483" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/xdgshellclient.h#L97" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>,
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/toplevel.h#L723-724" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/4890db3f16d1b9bd244f1a83c8d198ff93f6543b/abstract_client.h#L1276-1294" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
And until now we have looked only at header files.</p>
<p>To simplify all that,
eradicate this glaringly unnecessary complexity,
make the code actually comprehensible again,
I redesigned everything about it from the ground up.
This was for sure the most comprehensive and most difficult task.
And I had to go through several iterations before a final overarching model emerged
on how to handle <em>all</em> geometries of <em>all</em> windows,
on how to save and manipulate them via clearly defined structures and processes.</p>
<p>Some explanation for that model
can be found in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/merge_requests/68" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">primary Merge Request</a> of the geometries rework.
But as said, like with subsurfaces,
I plan to write about the reworked geometries soon
in a more detailed follow-up article.</p>
<h2 id="a-blossoming-heart">A Blossoming Heart</h2>
<p>Why did I call this project the <em>Windowing Revolution</em>?
Does it deserve this pathos?
The project was massive, that's for sure.
In sheer numbers <a href="https://gitlab.com/kwinft/kwinft/-/merge_requests/71" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the result</a>
is over 50 000 changed lines in over 300 commits.
I sacrificed over months all my time for this project, and my health.</p>
<p>But size or sacrifices alone do not make this a revolution.
Instead it comes through changes in our way of thinking
and how this project will reshape our future:
we radically redesigned the heart of our windowing manager,
we broke with overcome beliefs and traditions,
we simplified and reworked what was left rotten for decades.</p>

            <p>Back in 1994 a not yet know business owner posted a job listing on Usenet. It was for a company called Cadabra which would eventually turn into Amazon.com. As we all know Amazon has become a trillion dollar company and continues to grow. It’s fun to see that Jeff was utilizing Usenet to help grow his business. We can only assume that the C/C++ developer that got the position is happy they did. The exact message that Jeff posted to Usenet is pictured below.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Well-capitalized start-up seeks extremely talented C/C++/Unix developers to help pioneer commerce on the Internet. You must have experience designing and building large and complex (yet maintainable) systems, and you should be able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible. You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or the equivalent. Top-notch communication skills are essential. Familiarity with web servers and HTML would be helpful but is not necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>Expect talented, motivated, intense, and interesting co-workers. Must be willing to relocate to the Seattle area (we will help cover moving costs).</em></p>
<p><em>Your compensation will include meaningful equity ownership.</em></p>
<p><em>Send resume and cover letter to Jeff Bezos:</em></p>
<p><em>mail: be…@netcom.com</em><br>
<em>fax: 206/828-0951</em><br>
<em>US mail: Cadabra, Inc.</em><br>
<em>10704 N.E. 28th St.</em><br>
<em>Bellevue, WA 98004</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>When people talk about incentive alignment, what they really mean is correlated returns.</p>
<p>Consider equity as a solution principal-agent problems. Since founders and employees are both paid as a percent of company valuation, their returns are correlated, and incentives are mostly aligned. [1]</p>
<p>But even where returns are perfectly correlated, there’s no guarantee that actors actually have each other’s best interests in mind. A more concrete way to think about this is: would you be willing to delegate your decisions to the other party? This is what I mean by “true alignment”.</p>
<p>This can go wrong in at least three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Returns are correlated, but with different opportunity cost</li>
<li>Returns are correlated, but with different levels of risk</li>
<li>Returns are correlated, but with different second degree utility</li>
</ol>
<p>Real estate agents are typically paid on commission of a home’s sale price. As a result, their returns are really well correlated with the homeowner’s:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_XV2FycYR05hx0I4oVt7w38kIim-ElkWApsXwaHin-qO4kqy-CarjGsIvQjDzC2Z6UZVDURWUogHubZRisFwnrtKbn0fYAE_L6fKZOG4OOCGa1tDvA3dOfTjn79YzdbbDrMHKOVC" title="Chart"></p>
<p>In theory, this ought to mean that real estate agents and homeowners are truly aligned.</p>
<p>In practice, the real estate agent is the one doing work, which means that they’re the one paying opportunity cost.</p>
<p>Let’s say an agent can expect to earn $200/day, and gets paid 6% of home sale price. It’s not worth it for them to spend another 5 days of work pushing up your home price from $500k to $510k when this only nets them $600 against an opportunity cost of $1000.</p>
<p>In contrast, a homeowner would happily wait a week to get another $10k, or $9.4k after commission. Even factoring into account the time value of money, an additional 2% week-over-week is great.</p>
<p>If both sides were explicit about incentives and willing to broker a side deal, the homeowner would happily pay the full $1000 opportunity cost to get an extra $9000. But in the absence of transparency, the real estate agent will do their best to convince the owner to sell, even at net loss to their collective interests.</p>
<p>The result is correlated returns without true alignment. Neither side ought to trust the other.</p>
<p>Another classic example is Venture Capitalists versus Founders. For any given startup, a founder might own 30%, and the VC 10%, so their returns are really well correlated:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3JuiQ-W08HBI4QNLW73fwywCMFe7ekiGAsWnsHg1bhzB2xyh4hdJW5DDwE-RJx4SF9HwTOxiKo_5IZNuy89kh_qefoMz7JAOrR_VfOXjhGza5JL_KRpNcfIJEBH_LOO5Z5UW0eKE" title="Chart"></p>
<p>In theory, this ought to mean that VCs and Founders are truly aligned.</p>
<p>In practice, VCs are massively diversified across startups, providing insulation against any one failure. As a result, they’re eager to push for riskier bets, even when it’s against the interests of an individual founder.</p>
<p>Say you’re going out to dinner with a wealthier friend, and you’ve agreed to split the bill. No matter where you go, you’ll be paying the same amount, and getting the same consumption, so returns are really well correlated:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1xKYiiW4zC4nalzLSNMW3GDOOTAFfYZPkE_exWKYChAdbiyUdzUmhUjWa7UvHZ1JqpFO6DkNIwqdhNNOd6lkt6AvkGsd2heXblpqyU_9PULjvjp5Y8_AbyQSk3VyetHqIAcq4_Ne" title="Chart"></p>
<p>In theory, this ought to mean that wealthy and less wealthy diners are well aligned. You should be willing to let your friend pick the restaurant, and visa-versa.</p>
<p>In practice, each party may pay the same financial cost, but has a different marginal utility for their money. Assuming utility is something like log(wealth), the utility cost to a $100 dinner are far greater for you than for your wealthier friend.</p>
<p>Even assuming you have the same gastronomic tastes, your incentives are not actually aligned. You should not trust your friend to pick a restaurant. [2]</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Taking “true alignment” to mean “would be willing to delegate decisions”, and “correlated returns” to mean “correlated first order financial returns”, everything I’ve said is true.</p>
<p>But in all these cases, the trick is just to think about the actual experienced utility rather than first order financial returns.</p>
<p>It’s presumably pretty straightforward to sell a home for a fair price, but much more work to sell for substantially more than what it’s worth. So the opportunity cost increases faster than the price of the home. Taking that into consideration, we can chart the agent’s returns with a consideration of non-linearly growing opportunity cost:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IuLwQmsMceCLRT63Q6myNoGTUrTdPha-3mHx2RxMWN5IMjBTzczzOTxFy3D_29J6EESiyLN0mKSBOGIv6R85Cv17GPvdcT3Kcf0OTBuqGJPHNvALdIH5iGtuLAgwMaESNkrXkhWL" title="Chart"></p>
<p>Which makes it clear that returns were never really correlated to begin with.</p>
<p>Similarly, risk-avoidance is a function of diminishing returns from wealth. As a result, founders would prefer a more certain return, while diversified VCs can afford to pay in risk for higher expected returns.</p>
<p>So the conclusion is not that something wacky is going on and alignment is impossible. It’s just that we have to take into account returns to actual utility rather than just naively looking at immediate finances.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>
<p>I framed these as three different examples, but in a sense, they’re all the same.</p>
<p>The Venture Capitalist is risk-indifferent because they’re diversified. The founder is risk-averse because they experience diminishing returns from wealth to utility. Otherwise, a 1% chance of a billion dollar exit would be just as good as a guaranteed $10 million exit. So this is outwardly about risk, but really about second degree utility.</p>
<p>Arguably, diminishing returns to wealth are also just a function of opportunity cost. The more money you have, the less consumption in one place becomes a substitute for consumption elsewhere. This is also the case of a concave production-possibility frontier: the more you produce one good, the more the opportunity cost increases. This gives us a sense of diminishing returns, even without appeal to the hedonic treadmill or other psychological effects.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] Note that this only works for early employees at startups. The more your compensation is defined by salary rather than equity, the more your returns are fixed, and the less aligned you’ll be with your founders.</p>
<p>[2] Unless of course, they offer to treat you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>Lambda School is the most incentive-aligned education in the world.</p>
<p>It is so incentive-aligned, that their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/lambda-school-raises-74-million-incentive-aligned-education">fundraising announcement</a> was titled “Lambda School Raises $74 million for <strong>Incentive-Aligned</strong> Education”. Another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">blog post</a>, tilted “Taking Baby Steps Toward <strong>Incentive-Aligned</strong> Higher Education and Job Training” includes the phrases</p>
<ul>
<li>With <strong>incentive alignment</strong>, schools don’t succeed unless their students do.</li>
<li>We’ll continue to share updates on <strong>incentive-aligned</strong> education</li>
<li><strong>Incentive alignment</strong> between schools and students is the objective.</li>
<li>As long as the underlying principles of student protection and <strong>incentive alignment</strong> hold true, that’s what matters.</li>
<li>…create an education model where the <strong>incentives of the school and student are aligned</strong></li>
<li>…keep financial risk low for students and maintain <strong>incentive alignment</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lambda’s big innovation is the Income Share Agreement, a mechanism that allows students to pay the bootcamp as a percentage of their salary, rather than paying tuition upfront. This ensures that the bootcamp is free to attend until you get a job, and endures that Lambda is <strong>extremely incentive aligned</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>But is it actually?</p>
<p>Here’s the details of the Lambda deal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students pay 17% of their salary for 2 years,</li>
<li>Payments are capped at $30,000, no matter how much you’re making</li>
<li>Students only pay if they’re making over $50,000</li>
</ol>
<p>With this information, we can graph Lambda School’s 2-year returns against raw student income:</p>


<p>Those flat lines represent the cap and floor. The section in the middle is where Lambda Returns grow as a function of Student Income.</p>
<p>But remember that these returns come out of student income. So account for Lambda payments and taxation, here’s the same chart, but now with another line for Actual Student Income.</p>


<p>(<em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PjV77gc-96D4PPWZelJSWvT_U0-XLqXPWjEgRFf06ps/edit?usp=sharing">Source</a></em>)</p>
<p>That huge drop at $50,000 is the point where tuition payments kick in, and Actual Student Income drops off.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of a perverse incentive: students would actually earn more with a lower salary [1]. As payments and taxes scale with earnings, students aren’t back to the actual income they had at a raw salary of $49,000 until they hit a raw salary of $67,000, nearly $20,000 later.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we can divide the graph into 4 segments, and for each, ask if incentives are actually aligned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Not Aligned</strong>: Actual Student Income increases, but Lambda Returns do not.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>2) Misaligned</strong>: Actual Student Income drops, but Lambda Returns grow sharply.</li>
<li><strong>3) Aligned</strong>: Actual Student Income and Lambda Returns grow together.</li>
<li><strong>4) Not Aligned</strong>: Actual Student Income increases rapidly, but Lambda Returns are flat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-sections.png"></p><p>To summarize, the actual incentive-alignment portion of this graph only happens&nbsp;in section 3 (when raw income is between $67,000 and $88,000). Despite their repeated claims, Lambda School is not actually incentive-aligned.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, fine, but does this actually matter? Maybe all salaries fall in that incentive-aligned range, and so in practice, Lambda is effectively incentive-aligned.</p>
<p>We can test this hypothesis against Lambda’s table of reported student outcomes:</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-table.png"></p><p>We want to know how many students make between $67,000 and $88,000. Using a naive assumption of uniform distribution within buckets, we get 47 students, or 26% of the total population. [2]</p>
<p>To make a closer approximation, we can estimate an underlying normal distribution.</p>
<p>The range we’re curious about ($67k - $88k) doesn’t align with the bucketing, but we can make an educated guess by estimating the underlying normal distribution:</p>


<p>That’s with mean $72,000, SD $26,000. This is still naive, but seems to be a decent approximation, and probably better than the uniform assumption. Using this model, we estimate that 31% of graduates are earning $67,000 - $88,000.</p>
<p>To sum up, Lambda School appears to be incentive-aligned with around one third of their students.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Lambda School is not properly incentivized to improve income for the majority of its students, you might still argue that it is at least incentivized to get them a job.</p>
<p>This is fair, but also true of every other educational institution. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://flatironschool.com/jobs-reports/">Flatiron School</a> releases data on job placement outcomes, as does <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://generalassemb.ly/blog/outcomes-report-2018-2019/">General Assembly</a>, and does <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://poetsandquants.com/2017/06/26/draft-job-placement-rates-at-the-top-schools/">every university</a>. It doesn’t matter if you literally get paid as a portion of student income, every institution has a reputation to uphold, and a case to make for its value.</p>
<p>It is true that Lambda School only charges tuition if you get a job earning more than $50,000, and that’s great. For many students however, I expect this calculation to be dominated by the question of whether or not they’ll actually have a job at the end, a matter on which <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/lambda-lies/">Lambda School has been notoriously deceptive</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] This concept of being punished for earning money is at the heart of the libertarian critique of taxes. It’s absolutely bizarre that Lambda has appropriated libertarian rhetoric without any of the accomplaying economics.</p>
<p>[2] (75 - 67) / 25 * 71 + (88 - 75) / 25 * 46</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>Lambda School is a coding bootcamp that only charges tuition if you get a job. Founder/CEO Austen Allred frequently takes to Twitter, defending his bootcamp against <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">allegations of fraud</a>, and rebutting critics with case after case of student success.</p>
<p>I was initially excited about Lambda School, but have slowly grown disillusioned over time. So when they released their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">2019 H1 Outcomes Report</a>, I was excited to finally access a ground truth and put an end to all the speculation.</p>
<p>Instead, I found a consistent pattern of deception.</p>
<p>In the rest of this piece, I’ll walkthrough a number of examples, in which Allred:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims a job placement rate of 86%, when the actual number is as low as 55%, and at least as bad at 70%</li>
<li>Misrepresents graduate salaries on Twitter, despite claiming a random sample</li>
<li>Calls regulatory approval a “significant endorsement”, despite a troubled history of bans</li>
<li>Lies about having been homeless</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are blatant and explicit, some are more subtle. I’ve done my best to present the facts fairly, and leave the rest up to your judgement.</p>
<h3 id="1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes"><a href="#1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes" title="1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes"></a>1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes</h3><p>In early 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/austen/status/1082815326960533504?lang=en">Allred took to Twitter</a> to share student outcomes, listing the following salaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>J: $80,000+</li>
<li>S: $80k</li>
<li>D: $110k base, ($130k total)</li>
<li>C: $130k</li>
<li>T: $90k</li>
<li>L: $140k</li>
<li>J: $85k</li>
<li>L: $89k</li>
<li>A: $85k</li>
<li>R: $75k</li>
<li>S: $70k</li>
</ol>
<p>A year later, when the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, it cited a median salary of just $70,000. In stark contrast, Allred’s 11 Tweets report exactly 0 students making less than $70,000. Statistically, that’s like flipping a coin and getting 11 heads in a row (probability .00049).</p>
<p>This seems bad, but whatever, Allred is just highlighting a few heartwarming anecdotes right? Surely he doesn’t actually claim that this is a randomly selected sample?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1082818077132091393">Except he absolutely does:</a><br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/allred-tweet.png"></p>
<p>To see just how poorly Allred’s claims line up against the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a>, we can plot the histograms side by side:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-outcomes.png"></p>
<p>Allred claims that his examples were randomly selected, but his own statements are contradicted by the official outcomes report.</p>
<h3 id="2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates"><a href="#2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates" title="2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates"></a>2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates</h3><p>Earlier this year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">New York Magazine reported</a> that Lambda school had marketed itself as having an 86% job placement rate, but then released an investor memo reporting a much lower rate of just 50%.</p>
<p>Allred took to podcasts, explaining in an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview with Jason Calacanis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we talk to investors, we talk in terms of enrolled students… of those students who were enrolled, X% were hired. Whereas when schools speak publicly, they speak in terms of graduated students. So obviously those two numbers are always going to be different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That 86% was somewhat out of date… so we quickly put together what the real numbers would have been, which was 78%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so that seems reasonable enough. Case closed?</p>
<p>But then the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, and contradicted Allred’s own statements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 448 students in the cohort, only 318 graduated</li>
<li>Of those 318, only 284 graduated on time</li>
<li>Of 284 graduates, Lambda could only reach 255</li>
<li>Of those 255, only 201 had jobs</li>
<li>Of those 201, Lambda “did not have salary data… due to our data collection methods”, giving us data for 178 students</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The job placement rate for enrolled students is 201 out of 448, or 45%. The job placement rate for graduated students is 201/318, or 63%.</strong></p>
<p>It actually gets worse. The original Lambda School claim was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>86% of Lambda School graduates are hired within 6 months and make over $50k a year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But according to the outcomes report, 26 of the placed graduates are making under $50,000. <strong>The actual placement rate for graduates making over $50,000 is just 55%</strong>. That’s a far cry from the 86% they claim, and much closer to the 50% reported by New York Magazine.</p>
<p>To be clear about timing, the New York Magazine article was published February 19th 2020, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview</a> was on March 3rd, and the Outcomes Report was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/lambdaschool/status/1244054419471302664">published March 28th 2020</a>. So these should all be about the same cohort, or at least a similar set of students.</p>
<p>So where does the 78% come from? Following article, Allred published a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred?articleId=6637802701117882368">note on LinkedIn</a> with the following chart:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-flow.png"></p>
<p>So 78% is what you get if you ignore students who graduated late, ignore students who have yet to graduate,  ignore the “graduated and disengaged” students, and pretend everyone is making over $50,000.</p>
<p>To his credit, Allred does provide another table which includes disengaged sudents and reports a 70% placement rate. Not only is this a far cry from the 86% originally reported, it also includes the 15% of placed students making under $50,000.</p>
<p>Although it may seem fair to count late graduates in the H2 report, note that this is a misrepresentive sample. Students who graduate late will likely have worse results later on, and underperform students who graduated on time. If Lambda wanted to account for this, they could have included 2018 H2 late graduates in the 2019 H1 report, but they neglected to do so.</p>
<h3 id="3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School"><a href="#3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School" title="3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School"></a>3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School</h3><p>In March 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19374417">Allred wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Regulators love us</strong> - they’re sick of for profit schools promising a lot and delivering little except debt. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>December the same year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211717254712135680?lang=en">it was revealed</a> that Lambda was actually operating illegally, with no approval from regulators.</p>
<p>Okay, so this looks bad, but it doesn’t mean Allred is lying. It’s entirely possible that he thought regulators loved Lambda in March, and wasn’t corrected until a $75,000 fine hit the following month.</p>
<p>When Lambda finally did get approval to operate in California, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past year, Lambda School worked to advance an ambitious goal: become the first online school approved by California regulators to offer ISAs. <strong>We achieved a major victory when state regulators licensed us as a school in August, representing a significant endorsement</strong> for our all-online, career-focused education model. However, in order to secure this approval, we made the difficult decision to stop offering our ISA option to students in California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, none of this is an outright lie, but it is a dishonest representation of the regulatory environment. To recap:</p>

</ul>
<p>Then Lambda applies for approval, leading to this saga in which:</p>

</ul>
<p>As best I can surmise, those are the facts of this case. You can decide for yourself if you think Allred is acting with integrity.</p>
<h3 id="Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness"><a href="#Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness" title="Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness"></a>Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness</h3><p>This has nothing to do with Lambda School, and is admitadely somewhat gratuitous. But it does point to continued dishonesty on the part of Allred, and is too blatant to ignore.</p>
<p>In 2017, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/940658401209491456">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was homeless, had no skills, no degree, just $300 and a laptop, but that’s all you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17938403">2018 Hacker News comment</a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also formerly homeless…. I know how hard it is to focus on getting a job when you’re just trying to survive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bagholderreport.substack.com/p/lambda-school-is-the-culmination">article</a> includes a screenshot of an Allred’s reply to a tweet which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been homeless, slept on those same streets [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arc from homeless to multi-millionaire founder would be inspiring, except that it isn’t actually true.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6758165">2013 Hacker News comment</a>. Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I lived in a Honda Civic this summer as I was getting a startup off the ground… and <strong>I had a half dozen people offer to let me stay at their place or crash on their couch rent-free.</strong></p>
<p>….As a result, <strong>I wasn’t living in a car for lack of other options</strong>, but rather out of belief that I could create something by sheer will-power, and that I was going to do that come hell or high water. My homelessness was a matter of seeking something greater than myself, not being lost to poverty. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, in a now-deleted blog post titled <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://archive.is/OqxKP">Voluntary Homeless in Silicon Valley</a> Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Candidly, living in a car in Silicon Valley had much more appeal to me than a single bed and a shared bathroom… Much more than money, what fuels me is obsession with minimalism, reading way too much Thoreau, and trying to continually see life from a different angles…&nbsp; It’s about questioning society at its fundamentals, and seeing what a life not tied down by a foundation really feels like. And so far I love it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, Allred’s claims are… not technically a lie? I mean he did sleep out of a car, but he did it voluntarily. You’re free to make your own judgements, but when I hear “I have been homeless, slept on those same streets”, I do not think of someone with half a dozen offers of free housing. That isn’t poverty, it’s cosplay.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter"><a href="#Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter" title="Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?"></a>Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?</h3><p>Am I just piling onto an already heavily criticized company? Am I guilty of being a critic rather than a creator?</p>
<p>I initially wrote about this purely using Lambda School as an example to illustrate a broader point about incentive alignment. But the more I read, the clearer it became that they were just consistently dishonest. Not outright fraudulent, but just really misleading about everything from student outcomes, to regulatory pressure, to the founder’s own history.</p>
<p>Still, why does any of this matter if Lambda is genuinely educating and helping students?</p>
<div><p>First of all, despite the outcomes report, we still have no idea what the median outcome actually is! They’re reporting data for 178 out of 448 enrolled students, which is just 40%. According to the report, the other 60% of enrolled students either:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Remain unemployed (54 students, 12% of cohort)</li>
<li>Graduated late or not at all (164 students, 37%, of cohort)</li>
<li>Became mysteriously …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>A data scientist is a thriving career in this technology-oriented world. In fact, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-jobs-in-america-2019-1"><u>Glassdoor</u></a> named data scientists the number one job in the United States. Not to mention that the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-7/big-data-adds-up.htm"><u>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a> shared that the demand for data science skills will drive a 27.9% increase in employment in the field through 2026.</p>



<p>Considering the years-long consistent demand for data scientists, more and more people are taking their career in that direction. What this means for job-seeking data scientists is that the competition is fierce.</p>



<p>To stand out and catch the attention of hiring managers, you’ll need an optimized CV. Optimization will ensure that your CV is more attractive, but it will also ensure that it passes the ATS resume test.</p>



<p>Use the following tips to optimize your data scientist CV and get the job you want.</p>



<h2>Use the Keywords from the Job Description</h2>



<p>Hiring managers, as well as ATS, use keywords as one of the crucial filters for CVs. The job description is packed with specific keywords. Those keywords are what hiring managers should find in your CV.</p>



<p>Mine the keywords from the job description and put the same phrases on your CV. Using the exact words will further improve your chances. Why? Because hiring managers will be more attracted to the same words, they enlisted in the job description. It will simply signal that you are the perfect fit.</p>



<p>For example, the job description can list “machine learning,” “experienced in a fast-paced environment,” “<a href="https://selftaught.blog/how-to-optimize-your-cv-for-a-freelance-programmer-career/"><u>R programming</u></a>,” and “great written communication skills” as essentials. List those same skills in your CV. Within appropriate sections, of course.</p>



<p>To make the process of generating keywords easier, you can use a mining tool – <a href="https://resumeworded.com/job-description-keyword-finder"><u>Resume Worded</u></a>. Paste the job description within this online tool, and it will provide you with a list of main keywords.</p>



<p>Bear in mind that you should use keywords carefully. Stuffing your CV with keywords or listing qualities and experiences is frowned upon. Moreover, it can hurt your chances of getting the job.</p>



<h2>Personalize the CV for Different Job Postings</h2>



<p>Unless you plan to apply for a single job, your CV will need some personalization. Adapt the CV to match specific job descriptions.</p>



<p>First, optimize your CV for a certain job position. That initial document will serve somewhat as a <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-resume-for-freshers-a-complete-guide-with-templates/"><u>resume template</u></a>.</p>



<p>Whenever you plan to send out your CV to a different company, revise it, and personalize it if necessary. What falls under personalization, you ask?</p>



<p>Check which keywords a different job position asks for. You might need to make slight changes to soft skills or rearrange hard skills for maximum attractiveness.</p>



<p>Tailor the CV for each job posting. Thus, you’ll ensure that your CV is the right match for each job position.</p>



<p>You can use <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/"><u>Jobscan’s ATS testing tool</u></a> to check the consistency between your CV and the job description. The tool can give you feedback on resume aspects that need some more work.</p>



<h2>List the Hard Skills at the Top</h2>



<p>Hard skills are of the highest relevance for the hiring managers. Save them some time and list the hard skills first.</p>



<p>Create a section that will be dedicated solely to hard skills. The hiring managers can take a quick scan and assess whether you have what it takes.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-skills-for-a-data-scientist-in-2020-2b8e6122a742"><u>Towards Data Science</u></a>, the top 10 must-have skills for a data scientist job are:</p>



<ol><li>Probability and statistics</li><li>Multivariate calculus and linear algebra</li><li>Programming languages (Python, R programming, SQL, to name the top three)</li><li>Data wrangling</li><li>Database management</li><li>Data visualization</li><li><a href="https://insights.ai-jobs.net/can-you-teach-yourself-machine-learning/"><u>Machine learning</u></a>/Deep learning</li><li>Cloud computing</li><li>Microsoft Excel</li><li>DevOps</li></ol>



<p>The preferable way of listing hard skills is based on their demand. The job description will reveal which hard skills your employers prioritize. List the skills in the same order. If you possess skills that aren’t enlisted in the job description, name those last.</p>



<p>Depending on your resume length, consider how you’ll list the skills. For example, <a href="https://blog.flexiple.com/how-to-craft-a-freelance-resume-as-a-developer/"><u>a freelancer’s resume</u></a> often includes lengthier work experience (due to a number of smaller data scientist projects). Thus, you need to be mindful about rearranging the information. Who has the time for a 5-page resume?</p>



<p>To save some resume space, you can list your skills in a row. Another space-saving tip is to use bullet points but split the list into two columns.</p>



<h2>Impress with Numbers</h2>



<p>Your relevant achievements will be more notable if you back them up with data. Get employers excited about your capabilities with quantifiable accomplishments.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li><em>Used data mining techniques and machine learning to forecast the company’s sales of new services with a 97% accuracy rate.</em></li><li><em>Modernized data streamlining processes, resulting in 30% redundancy deduction.</em></li><li><em>Improved data mining processes, resulting in a 25% decrease in time needed to infer insights from customer data used for developing sales strategies.</em></li></ul>



<p>Whenever possible, state how your skills have contributed to the company or project. Quantifying the results will make a better impression on the hiring managers. It will make your accomplishments tangible.</p>



<p>It is recommendable that you use one sentence for the description per achievement.</p>



<h2>Provide a Description for Soft Skills</h2>



<p>To boost your chances of <a href="https://insights.ai-jobs.net/3-unintuitive-tips-on-getting-hired-for-data-science/"><u>getting hired for data science</u></a>, you need more than just suitable hard skills. Hiring managers will also pay close attention to your soft skills.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2019"><u>State of Data Science report</u></a>, around 60% of data science professionals work in teams (5 or more people). Consequently, you need to prove that you can be a valuable member of a company’s team.</p>



<p>Besides listing the soft skills that make you the perfect employee, you should also include a one-sentence description for each skill.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>Teamwork</strong></em><em> – Worked in a team of 5+ people for 4 years.</em></li><li><em><strong>Verbal communication</strong></em><em> – Led weekly round-up meetings with </em><a href="https://notbusinessasususal.com/benefits-of-remote-work/"><em><u>remote workers</u></em></a><em> to provide guidelines and give feedback.</em></li></ul>



<p>The description will clarify what that skill refers to. If listed just in bullet points, soft skills can be vague. They don’t tell much about your specific abilities in that way.</p>



<p>A concise description of every skill will paint the picture of what you can bring to the table.</p>



<h2>Apply a User-Friendly Design</h2>



<p>Lastly, you want the CV design to be optimized for the best UX. This means that it needs to be scannable, well-organized, and comprehensible.</p>



<p>Increase your CV’s UX by applying the following characteristics:</p>



<ul><li>Reverse-chronological layout for work experience</li><li>Relevant information only</li><li>Bullet points</li><li>White space</li><li>Minimalistic design</li><li>Single font type</li><li>Segmented sections</li></ul>



<p>The hiring managers should be able to glance at your CV and spot the information they are looking for. Browse the web for user-friendly resume templates. You’ll be able to get a better sense of how to organize your CV.</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>Whether your CV gets revised with a 10-second skim or it needs to pass the ATS test, optimization can get you that second round in the hiring process. Use these tips to craft a CV that is engaging, skimmable, and packed with attention-grabbing keywords.</p>



<p>All that is left for you to do after you write the perfect CV is to persistently send it out. With an impeccable and optimized CV in your hands, you can confidently apply for the jobs of your dreams.</p>

                    Introduction
                </h3>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Data is the new gold!</strong><br>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                
                Browsers are the most widespread access medium that makes it incredibly easy for us humans to connect to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">Word Wide Web</a>.<br>
                Due to the constant development of the Internet, such as the continuous elaboration of new standards and features, the introduction of powerful APIs and further interfaces on the browser side, the possibilities for collecting and analyzing data have also significantly expanded over the last few decades!
                <p>
                
                First and foremost, there is nothing wrong with collecting data at all. All of us collect data, whether unconsciously in private everyday life or completely consciously in school or at work - collecting data, interpreting it and drawing conclusions is actually incredibly important!
                </p><p>
                
                With the launch of the WWW for the public and the development of the first online services, data collection also started to become interesting for the various website providers, according to the motto <i>if I own a website, I also want to know who is surfing it</i>.
                <br>
                However, in most cases we as consumers only want to disclose as little as possible and only the data necessary for the intended service - in fact, <i>my private data is no one else's business</i>.
                </p><p>
                
                The above-mentioned further development of the WWW's capabilities has allowed data to be assigned to individual profiles, enabling the recognition of unique users and the ability to trace their browsing activities even across different pages - the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint" target="_blank">device fingerprinting</a>.
                <br>
                Some known methods for assigning a unique fingerprint to browsers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Hardware_benchmarking" target="_blank">hardware benchmarking</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Canvas_and_WebGL" target="_blank">fingerprinting via Canvas and WebGL</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Browser_extensions" target="_blank">analysis of active browser extensions</a>. 
                <br><b>This article is about a less known way to achieve something similar!</b></p><h3>
                    
                    Background
                </h3>


                Modern browsers offer a wide range of features to improve and simplify the user experience.<br>
                One of these features are the so-called favicons: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" target="_blank">favicon</a> is a small (usually 16×16 or 32×32 pixels) logo used by web browsers to brand a website in a recognizable way. 
                Favicons are usually shown by most browsers in the address bar and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks.

                <p>
                To serve a favicon on their website, a developer has to include an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" target="_blank">&lt;link rel&gt;</a> attribute in the webpage’s header.
                If this tag does exist, the browser requests the icon from the predefined source and if the server response contains an valid icon file that can be properly rendered this icon is displayed by the browser. In any other case, a blank favicon is shown.
                </p><div>
                    <pre><span>&lt;link </span><span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"icon" </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"/favicon.ico"</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/x-icon"</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
                </div>

                The favicons must be made very easily accessible by the browser. Therefore, they are cached in a separate local database on the system, called the favicon cache (F-Cache).
                A F-Cache data entries includes the visited URL (subdomain, domain, route, URL paramter), the favicon ID and the time to live (TTL). 
                <br>While this provides web developers the ability to delineate parts of their website using a wide variety of icons for individual routes and subdomains, it also leads to a possible <b>tracking scenario</b>.
                <p>
                
                    When a user visits a website, the browser checks if a favicon is needed by looking up the source of the shortcut icon link reference of the requested webpage.<br>
                    The browser initialy checks the local F-cache for an entry containing the URL of the active website. If a favicon entry exists, the icon will be loaded from the cache and then displayed. 
                    However, if there is no entry, for example because no favicon has ever been loaded under this particular domain, or the data in the cache is out of date, the browser makes a GET request to the server to load the site's favicon.
                </p><h3>
                    
                    Threat Model
                </h3>
                In the article a possible threat model is explained that allows to assign a <b>unique identifier to each browser</b> in order to draw conclusions about the user and to be able to identify this user even in case of applied anti-fingerprint measures, such as the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank">VPN</a>, deletion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">cookies</a>, deletion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache" target="_blank">browser cache</a> or manipulation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header" target="_blank">client header information</a>.
                <p>
                A web server can draw conclusions about whether a browser has already loaded a favicon or not:<br>
                So when the browser requests a web page, if the favicon is not in the local F-cache, another request for the favicon is made. If the icon already exists in the F-Cache, no further request is sent.<br>
                By combining the state of delivered and not delivered favicons for specific URL paths for a browser, a unique pattern (identification number) can be assigned to the client.
                <br>When the website is reloaded, the web server can reconstruct the identification number with the network requests sent by the client for the missing favicons and thus identify the browser.
                </p><ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Write</b> identification
                        <div><p>
                            The goal of the <b>write</b> operation is to generate a unique identifier and store it on the client side.<br>
                            First step is to create a new N-bit ID on the server and translate it to a path vector as shown below.</p><p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong></p></div><div>
                                <pre><span>const</span> N<span> = </span><span>4</span>;<br><span>const</span> ROUTES<span> = </span>[<span><span>"</span>/a<span>"</span></span>, <span><span>"</span>/b<span>"</span></span>, <span><span>"</span>/c<span>"</span></span>, <span><span>"</span>/d<span>"</span></span>];<br><span>const</span> ID<span> = </span><span>generateNewID()</span>;<span> // -&gt; 1010 • (select unassigned decimal number, here ten: 10 -&gt; 1010b in binary)</span></pre>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <pre><span>const</span> vector<span> = </span><span>generateVectorFromID(<span>ID</span>)</span>;<span> // -&gt; ["/a", "/c"] • (because [a, b, c, d] where [1, 0, 1, 0] is 1 -&gt; a, c)</span></pre>
                            </div>
                        
                        Second step is to store the actual data inside the browser:<br>
                        The user will be redirected along all of the website paths, starting at <i>/a</i>, navigating to <i>/b</i>, to <i>/c</i> and finally to <i>/d</i>.
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>/a</li>
                            <li>/b</li>
                            <li>/c</li>
                            <li>/d</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                       
                        While the user is redirected on every load the browser requests a favicon for the respective route, going the same way like<i>/a/favicon.ico</i>, to <i>/b/favicon.ico</i>, to <i>/c/favicon.ico</i> and finally to <i>/d/favicon.ico</i>.
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>/a/favicon.ico</li>
                            <li>/b/favicon.ico</li>
                            <li>/c/favicon.ico</li>
                            <li>/d/favicon.ico</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>

                        The webserver will now only process those favicon requests whose path is present in the previously created path vector. If the route is present the webserver answers with the favicon file and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200" target="_blank">Status 200 OK</a>.<br>
                        If the requested route is not in the path vector, the webserver aborts the request with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404" target="_blank">Error 404 Not Found</a>, or sends no response.<br>
                        Since the browser - as described earlier - only stores the delivered favicons in the F-Cache, we have now stored our unique identification number and the writing process is complete. <p>
                        In the above example, the webserver only responds to requests for the favicons under paths <i>/a/favicon.ico</i> and <i>/c/favicon.ico</i>. The F-Cache only has favicons-entries for these two paths.<br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Read</b> identification
                        <div><p>
                            Here the goal is to re-identify a returning user based on his existing F-Cache entries.</p><p>
                            In read mode the server always responds to favicon requests with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404" target="_blank">Error 404 Not Found</a> status, but responds normally to all other requests. 
                            This preserves the <b>integrity of the cached favicons</b> during the read operation, since no new F-cache entry is created by the browser.<br>
                            To reconstruct a visitor's identifier, the browser must be routed through all available routes. The server records which favions are requested by the browser (those that are not present in the browsers F-cache) and which are not.
                            </p><p>
                            
                            <strong>Example:</strong></p></div><div>
                                <pre><span>const</span> visitedRoutes<span> = </span><span>[]</span>;<br><span>Webserver.onvisit</span><span> = <span>(route)</span> =&gt; </span><span><span>visitedRoutes.<span>push(</span></span></span>route<span>)</span>; <span> // -&gt; ["/b", "/d"]</span><br><span>Webserver.ondone</span><span> = <span>()</span> =&gt; </span><span><span>{ <span>const</span> ID = <span>getIDFromVector(</span></span></span>visitedRoutes<span>)</span> };<span> // -&gt; 10 • (because "/a" and "/b" are missing -&gt; 1010b)</span></pre>
                            </div>
                            The server can thus reconstruct the identification from the missing favicon requests and the reading process is complete.
                            <br>

  <p>This weekend, I attended <a href="https://pioneer.app/hackathon">Pioneer’s first Hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>Their call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help upload the real world to the Internet. Work on something to make the experience of working on the web more fun for the billions staying at home. Overlay heart-rate on Zoom calls. Improve video conferencing quality. Build a Tandem competitor, one for friends rather than coworkers. The stage is yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My team of 1 had 48 hours to produce a working demo.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I played with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview">TensorFlow Lite’s PoseNet</a> model. I thought it had a lot of potential and I figured that this hackathon would be a good opportunity to find a use for it.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">quantified self</a> enthusiast, I track pretty much everything I do. While I’ve been able to <a href="https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/calendar/">automate a lot of what I track</a>, I’ve never been satisfied with the way I track my workouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I tried manual tracking using the <a href="https://www.strong.app/">Strong</a> app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried <a href="https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/nfc-water/">NFC tracking</a> using NFC tags and the <a href="https://nomie.app/">Nomie</a> app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried voice tracking using <a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> on my Google Home speaker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Could I use machine learning and a camera to automatically track my workouts? This hackathon would be my chance to find out.</p>
<p><em>You might wonder what workout tracking has to do with the hackathon’s theme of “mak[ing] the experience of working on the web more fun”. I think I might have stopped reading the prompt at “Help upload the real world to the Internet”, and decided that “the real world” would be my workout and that “the Internet” would be some cloud database. When I realized my mistake, I changed my pitch to “a way to encourage employees to be more active”.</em></p>

<h2 id="improving-performance">Improving performance</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was to grab the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android">TensorFlow Lite PoseNet Android Demo</a> from GitHub. The app uses the phone’s camera to track the location of 17 distinct keypoints (feet, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, neck, eyes, ears, elbows, and wrists), which it overlays on top of the video preview. After building it and deploying it to my phone, I noticed that the performance was terrible. On my Nokia 6.1—not exactly flagship material—the app struggled to maintain 10 FPS. That wouldn’t be fun to use or demo, so I investigated a bit.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/tensorflow-lite-posenet.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android">TensorFlow Lite PoseNet Android Demo</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After a couple hours of investigation, I had found and addressed <a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera/commit/83398fba33d09a4e306ff519ce0f65f851921ccc">3 important performance bottlenecks</a>. The app could now reach 25 FPS, improving performance by over 250%. While far from perfect, the app finally felt usable.</p>
<h2 id="assessing-accuracy">Assessing accuracy</h2>
<p>Over the next hour, I let my phone watch me perform all kinds of exercises, at different angles, distances, and lighting conditions. I paid close attention to the accuracy of the pose estimation overlay, to understand what kinds of exercises it would and wouldn’t be compatible with. For example, it’s extremely accurate at tracking all 17 keypoints when facing the camera and doing squats. Yet, it struggles to recognize anything other than my face (nose, eyes, ears) when facing the camera and doing push-ups. Likewise, it’s very good at tracking hand movements…until you hold a dumbbell and your hand suddenly disappear.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned to use pose estimation and a trained classifier to detect distinct phases of an exercise. For example, a burpee could be decomposed into these 3 phases: crouching, planking, and jumping.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/burpee.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Phases of a burpee (Photo: <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/the-best-burpee-variations-to-burn-fat-and-build-explosive-power/">Men's Journal</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, due to PoseNet’s inconsistent accuracy and the hackathon’s time constraints, I pivoted to something much simpler. Instead of classifying exercises, it would only count repetitions. To further simplify the scope, I would only support 4 bodyweight exercises: squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups.</p>
<h2 id="counting-repetitions">Counting repetitions</h2>
<p>As usual, I performed exercises in front of the camera, but this time I logged all frames (snapshot of 17 keypoints) to a CSV file. I then analyzed the data using Python and Google Colab, to look for patterns and find an appropriate repetition counting algorithm. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OHTsNyr3Ry_bSw8dT9s77BZsXHe7i8HR#scrollTo=uIbljMew7Wje">You can view the notebook here</a>.</p>
<p>The data looked like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/fitness-camera-logs.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Vertical position of 17 keypoints over time when performing 7 squats</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You don’t need to be a genius to look at this chart and figure out how many squats a person performed. I’m sure that many algorithms and machine learning models would equally qualified. But this was a hackathon and I couldn’t afford this level of sophistication.</p>
<p>Instead, I implemented the most basic algorithm imaginable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore all keypoints other than the nose.</li>
<li>Record the lowest and the highest position of the nose.</li>
<li>Count a repetition whenever the nose crosses the halfway point.</li>
</ol>
<p>It worked with squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups. I was satisfied.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="polishing-the-app">Polishing the app</h2>
<p>With the core functionality working and a few hours left before the demo, I decided to polish the app. I tweaked the colors, adjusted the layout, added audio feedback (“One!”, “Two!”, “Three!"), implemented some settings, designed an app icon, and published the APK. You can find the final product below:</p>
<!-- <img src="/img/fitness-camera-logo.png" /> -->
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera">GitHub repository</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdan-ZHiL6I">YouTube demo</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera/releases/tag/v0.1.0">Android APK</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the hackathon was a great experience. I was lucky enough to be selected as a finalist and I had the opportunity to demo my app to the judges. Next time, I’ll make sure to join a team.</p>

<![CDATA[Key Ways We Fail as Engineering Managers]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>Management tends to get bad rap and unfortunately many times rightfully so. Having a bad manager can make one’s life miserable and hinder their growth. Managers can seem like politicians who don’t know anything about our trade yet they give us directions.</p>
<p>On the other hand having a good manager can make you feel supported, can boost your career (and sometimes personal) growth and help make your team and company a happy place.</p>
<p>For better or worse, managers have a huge impact on their teams’ and direct report’s lives. It’s extremely important to understand some usual failure scenarios so we can course correct and provide better service and support to them.</p>
<p>Let’s see four usual ways we fail as managers.</p>
<h2 id="0-1-low-self-confidence">1. Low self-confidence</h2>
<blockquote><p>It’s not the lack of ability or opportunity that holds you back; it is only a lack of confidence in yourself.</p><p>—&nbsp;Richard Monckton Milnes</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve known much more engineering managers with low self-confidence than otherwise. Honestly, I can relate! It’s usually really hard to see our work’s positive effect, feedback loops are just too long, and cause-and-effect relations aren’t always trivial to see.</p>
<p>This is especially true for new managers, who just stepped into a completely new skill area and often try to cling to what they already know. It’s really taxing on one’s confidence to suddenly be a beginner again after previously being highly performing (engineer, many times). The end result is that we are trying to prove to ourselves (and sometimes to others, too) that we do deserve the manager role.</p>
<p>Feeling like this is entirely natural, and it can motivate us to learn and do better. Troubles start, though when this inspires the wrong kinds of behaviors in managers.</p>
<p>For one, continually demonstrating insecurity, in general, can undermine people’s confidence in us as leaders who can enforce our negative thoughts and create a vicious circle – we start noticing others don’t have much faith in us.</p>
<p>People with low self-confidence usually have a hard time saying “I don’t know”, which is essential as an engineering manager. We cling to the thought that we have to know answers to everything that comes up; otherwise, we’re just not performing well.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some insecure managers trying to do team members’ jobs. They do this not because they don’t trust their team, but they need something they’re proficient with to feel more secure and confident. This was partially the motivation for me to write one of my old posts titled&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/engineering-managers-stop-coding/">Engineering Managers, Stop Coding!</a></p>
<p>Another way for such managers to feel that they are still worth something is to be too nitpicky, for example, in code reviews or simply when giving feedback. Among many things, all this can lead to the team’s engineers feeling that their engineering manager is competing against them in a way.</p>
<p>I’ve seen another behavior of low self-confidence managers: they sometimes complain about their direct reports to other direct reports (please&nbsp;<strong>never ever</strong>&nbsp;do this!) or their manager.</p>
<p>Usually, this is only a transition period, but sometimes managers get stuck in this for years. A good support circle (the other managers in the company) and a good manager of the manager can help tremendously. Being able to discuss insecurities and fears with others can make you understand that this is normal, you’re not alone, and you can learn good coping and growth strategies from more seasoned peers.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-the-silver-bullet-aka-the-one-trick-pony">2. The silver bullet a.k.a. the one-trick pony</h2>

<blockquote><p>Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.</p><p>—&nbsp;Jelaluddin Rumi</p></blockquote>
<p>We might not be conscious about it, but we all have a natural, default style when it comes to management. This is shaped by our general personality, our experiences and things we’ve learnt along the way.<br>As managers, we unconsciously rely on this style, and without guidance, we tend to use that style with every direct report. Even when it becomes conscious, we justify this with ‘this is who I am’ and sometimes even with core values and our self-image (see my earlier post&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/stories-we-tell-ourselves/">Stories We Tell Ourselves</a>). Also, in many cases this style is actually the way&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;prefer to be managed.</p>
<p>While having strong core values is vital to being a successful leader, using a single management style just simply won’t work with all your direct reports over the years. Acting this way will harm some of your direct reports (and of course hinder your performance as an engineering manager, too).</p>
<p>One-trick managers often talk about the one true way to do things. They get overprotective about their style as they face more and more challenge. They often see the failure to be with the direct reports who don’t respond well to their style instead of adapting to theirs.</p>
<p>This usually shows in hiring, too – engineering managers who are stuck with one single style of leadership often prefer to hire people who are like them instead of diversifying the team.</p>
<blockquote><p>INTERVIEWER 1: I think you’ll be a really good culture fit, Dave.<br>INTERVIEWER 2: I have to say Dave, your answers really impressed us.<br>CANDIDATE: Thank you, Dave. You too, Dave.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks/status/1355757158458138624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tef_ebooks on Twitter</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These managers will have a fantastic relationship with some of the team members who’ll get most of their attention, leaving the others in the limbo a bit. These engineers who are left out will get frustrated and might end up doubting their performance if they don’t realize what’s happening.</p>
<p>As managers, it’s our core job to form a good working relationship with our direct reports. When this requires us to adapt our style or adopt new styles, it’s&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;job to do so. It’s not fair to expect our direct reports to adapt to our way of management.&nbsp;<a href="https://situational.com/situational-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Situational Leadership</a>&nbsp;is a part of this.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-too-much-business-focus-vs-too-much-people-focus">3. Too much business focus vs. too much people focus</h2>
<blockquote><p>I still believe in synergy, but I call it natural law.</p><p>—&nbsp;Barry Diller</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve all met managers who are only into business and view their direct reports as “resources”. They seemingly don’t care too much about their folks’ wellbeing and are only driven by deadlines, impact and KPIs. If the team is successful, it’ll make them happy, right?</p>
<p>We sometimes (much more rarely) see leaders who are only into the people part of their job. They create safe havens for their direct reports, try to protect them from the ‘evils’ of the world and the company and don’t seem to care about performance and business results too much. With a happy team, everything will just work out eventually, right?</p>
<p>These are obviously polar extremes – in reality, this works much more like a balance. Some business-focused managers actually do care a lot about their direct reports but firmly believe that the only way to happiness is a successful business. People-only leaders do sometimes nurture amazingly performing teams.</p>
<p>I just said ‘balance’, but I don’t view these to focuses as opposites. It’s much more about the balance of the short term and the long term. This balance manifests in many areas – solution quality vs. time to market, investing in the people vs. investing in the business, etc. etc..</p>
<p>Too much focus on the business in a leader will sometimes result in that leader prioritizing short term wins over long term ones. Such managers will talk a lot about holding people accountable. They are quick to ‘abandon’ direct reports who don’t fall in line in terms of team commitments and performance instead of coaching them and working on alignment. The sacrifice here can be tremendous: company culture suffers, and this setup won’t work in the long term. People will get burnt out and will leave. Sure, they will hire new engineers, but there’s the cost of onboarding and slowing down, lack of tenure and an overarching understanding of the product and systems and the job market will know what kind of place their company is.</p>
<p>Only focusing on the people without considering that you as a team are responsible for making the business successful can be equally detrimental. As an extreme case, a failed business won’t be able to eventually employ (as many) engineers. Individual and team success needs to align with the business’ success. Such leaders will often position themselves as gatekeepers of core values versus the rest of the company, or senior management. They will view their team as the last stand against the tides of evil.</p>
<p>This, in the end, is not about balance, I think, but rather about synergy (look, look, a buzzword!) – not building a silo of a safe haven for your team but finding a way for the individuals to grow and be successful in tandem with the business’ goals. Naturally, you need the right kind of company for this – if the company’s core values aren’t aligned with nurturing happy teams, it’ll naturally fail as a business, too. If you feel as a leader or as an individual contributor that you cannot stand by your company’s core values, by all means, do yourself the favor of finding a better place for yourself (unless you believe you can steer the company, of course).</p>
<p><strong>I’ve personally only seen high performing AND happy teams when business results and team happiness/health were aligned.</strong>https://newsletter.ochronus.online/embed</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When working on LOGaritmical, I initially had my primary keys defined as UUIDs. I took this approach for two reasons: security and to avoid collisions even when there are many rows. My initial reasoning was that I will probably need to store each log line in a separate entry and considering that one log can have a few thousands of lines, there was a small risk of overflowing the Integer. Was my reasoning correct? Probably not.</p><p>Furthermore, I stumbled upon an interesting article about <a href="https://tomharrisonjr.com/uuid-or-guid-as-primary-keys-be-careful-7b2aa3dcb439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using UUIDs as primary keys</a>. There were some really great points about performance and query optimization. To keep it short, It is best to use numerical values as the primary key. So, I started to change my implementation. But then, another problem came into my head: security.</p><h4>Why is exposing the PK bad?</h4><p>By their nature, Auto Incremented primary keys grow by one for each new entry. This is great for avoiding collision, but it means that they are easily guessable. If you somehow find out that a user with the ID 27 exists, it most probably means that there are at least 26 other users with IDs 1 to 26. An attacker can try to exploit this by sending requests with different IDs. Furthermore, since the Administrator is usually the first user registered, it can easily guess the ID and try to get access.</p><p>There were also many reports, even on high-profile sites, where a full or partial dump of the contents could be done by simply incrementing the ID. This is how Parler data was exposed, for example. Other such attacks are rather easy to find, so exposing the internal ID is bad practice. You can still use an auto-incremented primary key internal and use it for all foreign keys as well, but whenever it is sent externally, an alternative must be found.</p><h4>The Play Session Cookie</h4><p>You may think that as long as your URLs does not contain the primary key, everything is ok. However, here is another scenario: cookies. Whenever a user is logged in, a session must be saved so that the user can remain logged in and can properly navigate the restricted pages. Play Framework does this by storing a Play Session Cookie that looks something like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="874" height="96" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png 874w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-300x33.png 300w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-768x84.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px"></figure><p>This can easily be found using the browser’s inspector. At first sight it may seem a random string of characters, however it is much more than that. It is actually a BASE64 encoded JSON string with some additional, non-human-readable data, at the end. Decoding the string is easy and, even though changing it in the cookie may not be possible, it can still provide valuable information to an attacker if the PK is stored.</p><h4>Solution: How to avoid exposing the PK</h4><p>You use an UUID! But wait, didn’t I just say that using UUIDs is bad? You still use a numerical, auto-incremented, value for the PK and FK, but attach to it, in a separate column, a UUID. Whenever you are dealing internally, in the same application/system with the data, the numerical primary key is used.</p><pre title="Example UserDO that has both the Integer PK and the UUID column"><code lang="java">@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class UserDO {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "id", nullable = false)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.<em>IDENTITY</em>)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = "uuid", columnDefinition = "VARCHAR(36)")
    @Type(type = "uuid-char")
    private UUID uuid;

    @Column
    private String username;

    @Column
    private String email;

    @Column
    private String passwordHash;

    @Column
    private String passwordSalt;
}</code></pre><p>However, when the data needs to be sent externally, you provide the UUID. Now the attacker can’t guess the UUID (or at least he will have a really hard time in doing so) and the internal workings are hidden. You store the user UUID in the session and use that one when performing security checks. You provide the UUID to the article/user/what-ever in the URL and use that one when searching for the right item. Once you find it, internally, you can start referencing it by the PK, just be careful not to expose it outside.</p><p>Any additional data that is referenced using FK can still be easily retrieved by the DB and Hibernate since the numerical value is being used. In short, you get the best of both worlds by using a numerical PK internally and an UUID externally. Initial search for an item my be a bit slower, but I believe it is negligible.</p></div></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Hi! I'm Marcel, web developer at <a href="https://www.q42.com/">Q42</a> and creator of the <a href="https://micr.io/">Micrio storytelling platform</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started developing a JavaScript viewer for ultra high resolution 2D and 360° images with added markers, tours, audio, and more. Since then, I've been pushing to find the best balance between hardware performance, minimal CPU and bandwidth use, and compatibility for older browsers to deliver a sharp and high quality viewing experience.</p>
<p>For Micrio, it is vital that the performance on the client's browser is as good as possible. The reason for this is very simple: when you are being told a story, or watching a movie, even <em>a single frameskip</em> immediately takes you out of your experience.</p>
<p>Since Micrio is being used for an <a href="https://micr.io/showcases">ever growing list</a> of awesome projects, the most important thing is that for whoever visits a Micrio project, it must work, and <em>work well</em>: delivering fast load times, and a butter smooth interactive experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) is the ability for your browser to run <em>compiled</em> code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en">4th official web programming language</a>, after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With it, you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Rust, Go, AssemblyScript, <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">and many more</a>) in your browser, without any need for plugins.</p>
<p>Finding out about Wasm in late 2019 really made me want to try it out. Could I use this tech to make the Micrio client run smoother than the current version does? Would I need to rewrite everything in C++, and if so, how would that work? Would the effort be worth the gains it would give me? And not in the least.. <em>how does it work!?</em></p>
<p>This article describes my journey from upgrading the Micrio <strong>JavaScript-only client to use WebAssembly</strong>, with the hopes of improving performance, and taking my code to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="thecurrentversion">The current version</h3>
<p>To give a rough idea about the tech stack of the current latest JS-only revision of Micrio (<a href="https://b.micr.io/micrio-2.9.min.js">version 2.9</a>): This library as a single JS file works on all semi-modern browsers, including even Internet Explorer 10 for 2D, and IE 11 for 360° images.</p>
<p>It uses Canvas2D for the rendering of 2D images, and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>/WebGL rendering for 360° images. Written in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=es6">ES6 JavaScript</a> (or ECMAScript 6, the latest version of JavaScript), it still <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">compiles</a> to ES5 to support Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, displaying a <a href="https://micr.io/i/xCSYV/">231.250 x 193.750 pixel image</a> in your browser in a matter of milliseconds, allowing the user to freely zoom in and navigate, requires a little bit of processing power.</p>
<p>Now, Micrio 2.9 <em>isn't bad</em>. It runs pretty smoothly on all devices. But with WebAssembly around the corner, allowing all calculations to be done at native CPU speeds, this could potentially make a big difference in making Micrio's performance even better, and could improve the code architecture a lot.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, this could also mark the setup for a new major version, where I will draw a clear line and drop all compatibility and polyfills for older browsers: <strong>Micrio 3.0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="firstrewritecandemscripten">First Rewrite: C++ and emscripten</h2>
<p>As a first step into the world of WebAssembly, getting to know the ecosystem, I started to play around with <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a>. With it, you can take almost any project made in C or C++, and compile it to a binary <code>.wasm</code> file that your browser can natively run.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and ends, and how autonomously it could run inside your browser. So I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a C++-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual <em>zoomable</em> and <em>pannable</em> image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.</p>
<p>It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl</a>: a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> image library.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/cpp.png" alt="Setting up SDL and OpenGL" title="C++ in the 21st century"></p>
<p>The largest struggle of this was picking up C++ again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;</li>
<li>Image tiles downloading;</li>
<li>Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;</li>
<li>Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;</li>
<li>Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this version running here: <a href="https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html">https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html</a> :</p>

<h3 id="firstresults">First Results</h3>
<p>As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in C++ running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.</p>
<h4 id="1codingcfeltoldfashioned">1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned</h4>
<p>Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially for me as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized <code>Makefile</code> than I care to admit.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/makefile.png" alt="The emscripten C++ Makefile" title="( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"></p>
<h4 id="2thecompiledwasmbinarywasverylarge">2. The compiled <code>.wasm</code> binary was very large</h4>
<p>As great as the help of <code>libsdl</code> and <code>stb_image.h</code> were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all <code>emcc</code> compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome <code>closure</code> JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB. Compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.</p>
<h4 id="3tilagluefile">3. TIL: A <em>glue</em> file</h4>
<p>This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. <strong>WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box</strong>. It actually needs to be <em>bound</em> to the browser using JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/glued.png" alt="glue clipart"><br>
<small><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-13445.html">Image source</a></small></p>
<p>Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: <em>wrong</em>. What <code>emscripten</code> does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and <em>convert them</em> to WebGL operations your browser can understand.</p>
<p>Same with the <code>libsdl</code> mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were <strong>glued</strong> to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<p>Everything added together, the new total of the <em>base engine</em> of Micrio was a whopping <strong>791KB</strong>; a bit too much for my liking.</p>
<h2 id="secondrewriteassemblyscript">Second Rewrite: AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few months, to just after having attended the awesome <a href="https://webassembly-summit.org/">WebAssembly Summit</a> in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.</p>
<p>During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE">synth demo</a> written in <strong><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a></strong>, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a <code>.wasm</code>-binary. So anyone familiar with either TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 will not have a lot of difficulties using it.</p>
<p>And the great thing-- it's all installed using <code>npm</code>, so <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html">getting it up and running</a> and compiling your program is super easy!</p>
<p>There are a few basic <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html"><code>types</code> added in AssemblyScript</a>, which are required for compile-time optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f64</code> / <code>f32</code> : For 64 or 32-bit floats;</li>
<li><code>i8</code> / <code>i16</code> / <code>i32</code> / <code>i64</code> : For signed <code>int</code>s, ranging in precision</li>
<li><code>u8</code> .. <code>u64</code> : For unsigned <code>int</code>s</li>
<li><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html">And a few more</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goingatomic">Going atomic</h3>
<p>This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. <em>How small can we get it?</em> I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/assemblyscript.png" alt="Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript" title="My First AssemblyScript"><br>
<small><em>Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript</em></small></p>
<p>The result: a 3KB binary containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers some <em>glue-tooling</em> by providing its own <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html">Loader</a>, which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call these functions.</p>
<p>However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API">WebAssembly API</a>, <em>neat</em>. And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the <code>fetch</code> API to load your compiled <code>.wasm</code> file, cast it as an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, and use the <code>WebAssembly.instantiate()</code> function to get it up and running.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/instantiate.png" alt="Loading a wasm file" title="Gluing it yourself"></p>
<p>The compiled binary will then offer an <code>exports</code> object, containing the functions that you have exported in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions.</p>
<p>Wait.. "<em>which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions</em>"...</p>
<p><strong>WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!</strong> 🤯</p>
<p>Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would be <code>async</code>. Nope, the Wasm-functions you call will return immediately!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/exports-and-imports.html#exports"><em>This is, like, powerful stuff</em>!</a></p>
<h3 id="bundlingthecompiledwasminsidethejsfile">Bundling the compiled Wasm inside the JS file</h3>
<p>Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9).</p>
<p>However, I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the Wasm binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS. So I included a <code>base64</code> encoded version of the Wasm-file <em>inside</em> the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that. As a …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning">Google</a></figcaption></figure><p>There is a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of tools supporting each individual stage of this cycle, which forces data science teams to build custom pipelines for the various ML frameworks (or even individual algorithms) that they use. Something as inconsequential as training and deploying a simple Scikit Learn linear regression model to SageMaker can take weeks or months to productionize, if your team doesnâ€™t have a pipeline already built for these specific frameworks.</p><p>In a world where itâ€™s no longer enough to train a model once, deploy, and forget about it, organizations are facing ever-mounting challenges with developing in-house MLops frameworks and processes.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a> â€” an open source framework created by Databricks to unify the model lifecycle management, used by Facebook, Zillow, Microsoft, and a host of other AI-first companies. MLflow seeks to directly address the key problems of model tracking and interoperability between different ML tools. MLflow works with any ML library, framework, or language, removing barriers to rapid prototyping and leading to quicker turnaround times for solving business problems in production.</p><p>For the perspicacious ML engineer, MLflow provides an intuitive and straightforward approach to model deployment while solving many of the common problems, such as tracking model metadata and persisting models in a registry, within the framework itself. Instead of building complicated in-house infrastructure for keeping track of your models (and their performance), MLflow provides simple, powerful tools to manage your models from inception to serving happy customers.</p><h2 id="monitoring-in-mlflow">Monitoring in MLflow</h2><p>One of the key features in MLflow is the ability to capture detailed metrics for your models. The framework is not opinionated about what you should log. Instead it provides a simple API for recording whatever data you might find useful. This is accomplished via calls to <code>mlflow.log_metrics</code> in your MLflow runs, and you can find additional examples and documentation <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#performance-tracking-with-metrics">here</a>.</p><p>These metrics can later be <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#visualizing-metrics">visualized</a> via the MLflow server interface, which is super handy for tracking model metrics across different iterations of a model, or over time.</p><figure><div><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>MLflow metrics visualization. Source: <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#visualizing-metrics">MLflow</a></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, MLflow has <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging">autologging integrations</a> with all the commonly used ML frameworks, providing a straightforward method to logging performance metrics.</p><p>However, the logging solutions native to these frameworks generally focus on model performance itself, such as its accuracy and loss, and do not adequately capture information about the context and environment in which your models operate. Figuring out <em>why </em>your models may be underperforming is a nigh impossible task if you donâ€™t capture this context.</p><h2 id="monitoring-data-quality-with-whylogs">Monitoring Data Quality with whylogs</h2><p>Luckily, MLflow makes it easy to add integration with third party libraries, so that various additional metrics can be collected both during the training process and once the model is live. By integrating whylogs into the MLflow runtime, we can add data quality monitoring to the model pipeline. <a href="https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs-python">whylogs</a> is an open source, lightweight, and high performance statistical data logging library that enables a fire-and-forget approach to logging data quality by profiling the data during training and as it flows through the model once it has been deployed.</p><p>Profiling data with whylogs allows engineers and data scientists to catch data quality issues during training as well as detect data drift after deployment, which ultimately enables a more informed analysis of the modelâ€™s performance over time. Rapid response to issues in production is also made possible, as data quality degradation can be uncovered in near real-time.</p><p>Why use whylogs over an in-house solution or another library? Great question!</p><ul><li>whylogs is entirely open source. No hidden rocks, undocumented interactions, or unsolvable data governance concerns.</li><li>It profiles data in an extremely efficient manner, with a constant memory footprint and low CPU overhead, letting it easily scale from megabytes to terabytes of incoming data. Save those GPU cycles for your models!</li></ul><figure><div><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>whylogs Java performance metrics.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Two things that aren’t changing are (1) customers are always going to want simpler ways to interact with their cloud infrastructure and (2) they’re always going to want tools to understand where their cloud costs are coming from to make better business decisions. Vantage is aiming to help with both of these challenges but customers also use other tools to help make informed business decisions. One of the most popular tools we found people using is Ec2instances.info and today I’m happy to announce that Ec2instances.info is joining forces with Vantage.</p><p>Ec2instances.info will now reside at instances.vantage.sh and exists in its same form. The site will continue to be completely free and we have plans to add more features and functionality to it, including additional service prices beyond virtual machine pricing. We’ve ensured that the redirects have backwards compatibility with the prior domain so everything should continue to work as expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Garret Heaton, the creator of Ec2instances.info, says:<br></p><blockquote>After running ec2instances.info as a side project for <a href="https://powdahound.com/2011/03/hosting-a-static-site-on-amazon-s3-ec2instances-info/">almost a decade</a> I'm thrilled to hand over the reins to the Vantage team. Watching the site help people year after year has been a real pleasure and I'm very grateful for all the bug reports and improvements submitted by the public. In recent years the amount of choice available in instance types has grown significantly so comparing them is especially important, but I haven't had time to improve the site at the same rate. I'm very excited to see Vantage invest in the site as well as help people control costs across their entire infrastructure.</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Vantage is built by working backwards from customer feedback and we hope to use the same playbook for instances.vantage.sh - so please join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-mc723hg0-64opi05ckDf3gE56xapntg">Slack Community</a>, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/joinvantage">Twitter</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:support@vantage.sh">support@vantage.sh</a> to let us know your use-cases and how we can help.</p><p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong><br></p><p><strong>What is Vantage?</strong></p><p>Vantage is an alternative AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is EC2Instances.info?</strong></p><p>Ec2Instances.info, now instances.vantage.sh, is a tool for comparing hundreds of EC2 Instance Types across different instance type attributes.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>I use EC2Instances.info - how will this impact me?</strong></p><p>Only the domain is changing and all existing links will redirect in a way that preserves filters. For all intents and purposes, you shouldn’t be impacted.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>Do I need to be a registered Vantage user to use instances.vantage.sh?</strong></p><p>No. That being said, we are offering a one-time coupon code of $25 to all EC2Instances users that you can apply to your Vantage account using the coupon code of INSTANCES. This offer will expire on March 31st, 2021.</p><p><strong>I have a feature request for ec2instances.info - how can I submit it to you?</strong></p><p>You can continue to leave feedback on the existing <a href="https://github.com/powdahound/ec2instances.info">Github repository</a>, email <a href="mailto:support@vantage.sh">support@vantage.sh</a> with the subject line “Product Feedback Request” or join the “instances-vantage-sh” channel in the Vantage <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-mc723hg0-64opi05ckDf3gE56xapntg">Slack community</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

In 2001, Mike Cannon-Brookes sent an email to his college classmates in Sydney, asking if anyone was interested in helping him launch a tech startup after graduation. Back then, entrepreneurship wasn't a popular career path in Australia; and Mike's only taker was Scott Farquhar, a fellow student who shared Mike's passion for computers and his frustration for the corporate grind. Together they launched Atlassian, a two-man tech support service that they managed from their bedrooms at all hours of the night. Unable to make money, Scott and Mike decided to pivot and sell some of the software they'd developed for themselves. Out of that grew Jira, a project-management tool that's used in all sorts of endeavors, from pizza delivery to the exploration of Mars. Today, Atlassian is valued at over $50 billion and Scott and Mike are Australia's first startup-to-IPO tech billionaires. </p><p>HIBT Virtual Event with Jay Shetty - information and tickets at: <br><a href="https://nprpresents.org/">https://nprpresents.org</a></p></div></div>]]>

      <p>This blog post is about what makes it so difficult to balance different needs in a good setup for cloud and email accounts, and my journey to a good solution. For those who want to see the ending right away, here's the ultimate setup I've landed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email: Fastmail, with aliases forwarding my family's email to their respective Gmail accounts</li>
<li>Neither Google nor Microsoft having special handling for my domain name (<code>snoyman.com</code>)</li>
<li>Cloudflare for domain name registration (via transfers) and domain name serving</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting static sites, though I'll look into Cloudflare Pages soon hopefully</li>
<li>Code for sites on Github</li>
<li>Dynamic sites still hosted on an <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/products/kube360">FP Complete Kube360 cluster</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, does that jumble of words mean anything to you? Probably not much. The real questions are what I had tried previously, what problems I encountered, and how these choices overcame them. Let's hit it!</p>
<h2 id="michael-unmarried-sets-up-email">Michael, unmarried, sets up email</h2>
<p>Many years ago, I purchased <code>snoyman.com</code> so that I could host my own email and have the nifty looking email address <code>michael@snoyman.com</code>. I was probably around 20 at the time, and this seemed like the coolest thing in the world to me at the time. (Or so I think, I really can't remember that long ago well.) In any event, the first question is: where should I set up my mail hosting? I'm not sure if I tried other providers first, but at some point Google offered Google Apps for free (later renamed G Suite, later renamed Google Workspace), and I signed up and began using it for hosting my own email.</p>
<p>The first problem with this was that <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> became a <em>quasi Google account</em>. What I mean by that is that, on all Google systems, <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> was a valid username/account ID/whatever you want to call it. But not all of them supported Google Apps. If I remember correctly, in the glory days of Google Reader, I wasn't able to access it from Google Apps. And this is the first lesson in this saga:</p>
<p><strong>The cloud providers offer neutered accounts on their business-geared email hosting.</strong> We'll see this issue get worse with kids on Google, and completely repeat with Microsoft.</p>
<p>So I ended up creating a separate Gmail account <code>@gmail.com</code>, and setting up forwarding from one email address to the other. That meant I got full access to Google services, had a single inbox to check, and kept my snazzy <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> account. Downside: I often had the annoying question of "which Google account did I log into this service with?"</p>
<h2 id="forwarding-for-the-family">Forwarding for the family</h2>
<p>Others in the family decided they liked these <code>@snoyman.com</code> email addresses, and wanted them too. It was easy enough to set up some forwarding for various family members through Google Apps to their Gmail accounts. I don't know if they ran into similar issues with the multiple-sorta-Google-accounts issue.</p>
<h2 id="the-kids-need-accounts">The kids need accounts</h2>
<p>At some point, many years later, my parents bought my kids Android tablets. This necessitated setting up Google accounts for them. And this is where things broke down completely. Assuming I had a daughter Alice, the obvious email address would be <code>alice@snoyman.com</code>. Which would most directly mean creating a user account on the Google Apps instance (now called G Suite).</p>
<p>However, G Suite accounts didn't have full support for the family sharing and child protection limits we wanted to place. So again, we ran into the situation of needing both regular Gmail accounts and Google Apps accounts. So instead, I decided to go towards the forwarding setup I'd used for other family members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each child gets a Gmail account, joined to our family's Google Family account</li>
<li>Children log into their tablets using those accounts, allowing us to control screen limits and other issues</li>
<li>I set up forwarding from G Suite from their <code>alice@snoyman.com</code> address to <code>alice.snoyman@gmail.com</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, within Gmail, I set up aliases for each child, so that <code>alice@snoyman.com</code> can be used as a login for their Gmail account. This means that if anyone tries to invite them to a document, for example, it goes to the correct Gmail account, which is nice.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-g-suite">Dropping G Suite</h2>
<p>At this point, the only person who had email actually hosted on G Suite was me. I was the only one left with two of these Google-ish accounts (a real <code>@gmail.com</code> address and the G Suite <code>michael@snoyman.com</code>). Getting rid of that was pretty easy: have G Suite forward emails from <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> to my <code>@gmail.com</code> account, and set up an alias in my Gmail account.</p>
<p>This left two problems, one minor, one slightly-less-minor. The first is that I had this entire G Suite setup for no reason other than forwarding emails around, which is silly. That's minor. The other problem is about email security. When you have forwarding set up like this, and when you send email from a different domain through Gmail, the security protocols of email don't perfectly reconcile things. I'm probably getting some of the details wrong, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email sent to <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> would arrive in my Gmail inbox with a DKIM failure, since the domain names (snoyman.com vs gmail.com) didn't match</li>
<li>Email sent from Gmail through my <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> address would say "via gmail.com" on the receiving end</li>
<li>If I used a desktop mail client instead of the web interface, there wasn't a way to have the email come from <code>michael@snoyman.com</code> at all</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not familiar with the email security systems of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, consider yourself lucky. But suffice it to say that I realized I was pushing the limit of what "correct" email usage was.</p>
<p>Was this a big deal? Arguably not. Arguably I should have just stopped here. And for a while I did. But it always irked me.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-to-the-rescue-nah">Microsoft to the rescue? Nah</h2>
<p>The real issue above was that I was trying to use Gmail to handle a different domain name, which it's definitely not intended to do. And on the other hand, using G Suite for that domain name—which <em>is</em> intended to work—doesn't work well for accessing the full suite of Google services. So I got a great idea: what if I moved <code>snoyman.com</code> from G Suite over to Microsoft's online offering? I had made that move for work, where we'd recently embraced Microsoft 365, and the migration was fairly painless.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <em>exact same issue</em> immediately popped up. On the Microsoft side, there are two kinds of accounts: A "Microsoft Account" and a "Microsoft Work or School Account." Both Google and Microsoft could really do a better job of signposting the differences between their account types and giving them useful names. But the exact same restrictions came into play. If I put <code>snoyman.com</code> as a domain in Microsoft 365 (and/or Azure AD, for anyone keeping score at home), I would have conflicts with normal Microsoft Accounts for myself and the kids. And as the kids were right then getting into online classes due to COVID, using Windows 10 laptops with Microsoft account logins, and playing a lot of <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2021/01/parents-guide-minecraft/">Minecraft</a>, I didn't want to go down this path.</p>
<p>Instead of all that, on the Microsoft side, I created each kid their own Microsoft account with their <code>@snoyman.com</code> email address, and never had Microsoft manage our emails at all.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-g-suite-hello-google-domains">Dropping G Suite, hello Google Domains</h2>
<p>At some point, I noticed that Google Domains had support for some useful features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bare name redirects (e.g. redirecting from <code>http://snoyman.com</code> to <code>https://www.snoyman.com</code>)</li>
<li>Email forwarding</li>
</ul>
<p>I moved a few of my domains over to Google as the registrar, configured some email forwarding and various website redirect rules, and I was finally free of my G Suite account. And just in time to avoid Google renaming <em>yet again</em> to Google Workspace. Hurrah!</p>
<p>I still had the email security issues I mentioned above. I solved one of them by setting up outgoing email to be sent via Mailgun, which allowed proper handling of SPF and DKIM. But this was yet another component I needed to maintain, and still didn't feel satisfactory.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>I realized at some point in all of this that I was obsessing over fairly unimportant details around email. No one really cares if my emails said snoyman.com or gmail.com in the headers. I wasn't checking DKIM signatures on incoming messages. Why was I still bothered by all of this?</p>
<p>And the reality was that I simply wanted to get off of Google for my email. Like many others, I'm bothered by Google's (lack of) privacy practices, and them knowing too much about me. I didn't really like them controlling my domain names either.</p>
<p>So over the weekend, I decided to finally bite the bullet and look into a solution one of my coworkers had told me about.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-fastmail">Moving to Fastmail</h2>
<p>I'd investigated Fastmail earlier in this saga, but was concerned I wouldn't be able to handle the large number of email forwards needed for all my family members. Maybe when I initially investigated, that was in fact correct. However, when I investigated this weekend, I found out that Fastmail does, in fact, support "600+ alias addresses." I was out of excuses.</p>
<p>I purchased a standard account for myself at $50/year, set up aliases for all of my family members, and switched over my DNS records. I imported my email and contacts from Gmail into Fastmail. I configured my local Outlook desktop client (which I was already using for work) to talk to Fastmail. I installed the Fastmail app on my phone. And just like that, I had everything I wanted! Plus a mail storage limit of 30GB instead of 15GB. And honestly, I was starting to edge towards that 15GB limit.</p>
<p>Since the rest of my family is happily using Gmail and doesn't intend to switch, no additional changes were necessary. But it's very nice to know that, any time they want, I can sign them up for a Fastmail account on our domain and switch over fairly seamlessly.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-cloudflare">Moving to Cloudflare</h2>
<p>Now that I didn't have any email forwarding going on with Google Domains, the only …</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>Ever so softly, European politicians are beginning to voice a once unthinkable threat by suggesting they could snatch patents from drug companies to make up for massive shortfalls in the supply of coronavirus vaccines.</p>



<p>Big Pharma businesses have for many years regarded EU countries as unquestioningly loyal allies over intellectual property rights in the international trade arena. The EU could always be relied upon to defend U.S., Japanese and European drugmakers from poor nations in Africa and South Asia that have long wanted the recipe of critical medicines to be handed over to generic manufacturers. </p>



<p>But fury over the inability of companies to deliver on contracts amid the COVID-19 pandemic means that now even European politicians, from the Italian parliament to German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, are arguing, albeit cautiously, that patents may no longer be as sacrosanct as they once were. </p>



<p>The big question is whether they are just saber-rattling, knowing full well that any patent raid would shatter an ultimate commercial taboo and risk an exodus of leading companies from Europe over fears about the loss of IP.  </p>



<p>The European Commission's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, a doyen of French big business, is at pains to stress that there is <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1598714">no question of redistributing patents.</a> On Wednesday, he insisted that he would lead efforts by Brussels to help pharmaceutical companies expand their production sites and cooperate on output. “I will make sure they get everything they need,” he said.</p>



<p>That more traditional pro-business stance from Breton will prove comforting to pharma executives, who are now facing far more hostile messaging from other quarters of the EU. </p>



<p>European Council President Charles Michel last week raised the prospect that the EU could adopt “urgent measures” by invoking an emergency provision in the EU treaties in response to supply shortfalls. Commission officials have pointed to powers in Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which ostensibly could be used to force vaccine makers to share their patents or other licenses — known as compulsory licensing.</p>



<p>Europe's most powerful economy minister, Germany’s Altmaier, who hails from the business-friendly center-right Christian Democratic Union, also seemed open to the possibility. During a<a href="https://www.zdf.de/politik/maybrit-illner/corona-virus-ohne-grenzen-hat-europa-die-kontrolle-verloren-sendung-vom-28-januar-2021-100.html" target="_blank"> television talk show</a> last week, Altmaier said compulsory licenses wouldn’t help to increase production in the next couple of months because it would take time to set up additional production centers. But if cooperation among pharmaceutical companies to increase production should fail, he said, he “would be willing to talk about coercive measures.”</p>



<p>Adding to the chorus, Alexis Tsipras, former Greek prime minister and current leader of the main opposition Syriza party, has called for a European patents pool. In an opinion piece for <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccines-public-good-not-corporate-product/">POLITICO</a> last week, he warned that depending on a few pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for the whole of Europe is a “weak” strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Going nuclear</h3>



<p>India and South Africa are pushing for a nuclear option, above and beyond compulsory licensing. They want a temporary international waiver on the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all coronavirus-related medical products, including vaccines and treatments.</p>



<p>This is set to come up on the agenda of the informal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm" target="_blank">TRIPS Council meeting</a> Thursday, but is set to meet almost universal opposition from wealthy countries at the World Trade Organization, with the EU, U.K., U.S., and Switzerland all coming out against it. </p>



<p>Intriguingly, however, even here, potential cracks are emerging in the longer term European position. In early December, the Italian parliament passed a resolution <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.camera.it/leg18/410?idSeduta=0440&amp;tipo=documenti_seduta" target="_blank">calling on the government to support the waiver</a>.</p>



<p>Civil society’s hopes were further boosted during the C20 — a civil society meeting that runs parallel to the G20 — from January 25 to 27. According to several attendees, Italian officials suggested that the Italian G20 presidency this year could support the waiver. </p>



<p>However, other attendees have played down the importance of those comments, since they weren't issued at the ministerial level and were conciliatory in tone. Indeed, at the official level in Geneva, the Italian foreign ministry said Rome's position was still fully in line with the European Commission's. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, Brandon Locke, policy and advocacy manager at ONE Campaign anti-poverty advocacy group, believes the Italian debate “might just be the crack in the ice to sort of get things rolling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The fallout from the AstraZeneca and Pfizer [vaccine] delays are really causing a massive shift in how a lot of member states are thinking about vaccine supply and the traditional frameworks through which manufacturing was supposed to be carried out,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tommaso Valletti, former chief competition economist at the Commission, has also signaled support for the waiver and the issuing of compulsory licenses. "Do we really believe that this would 'jeopardize' future innovation? 2.2m people are dead," he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TomValletti/status/1356609791527964677" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there remains the formidable hurdle that WTO decisions must pass by consensus: Even if Italy did support the waiver, it's unlikely to make any difference.</p>



<h3>Push for unilateral action </h3>



<p>While unified WTO action is unlikely, the EU, U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Japan have offered to help members that want to implement existing "flexibilities" in the WTO’s intellectual property agreement, according to one Geneva trade official.&nbsp;That brings compulsory licensing into play, and countries can implement this individually. Several countries, including <a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/fr/insights-and-events/insights/2020/04/covid-19-and-public-compulsory-licensing-of-drugs-in-europe" target="_blank">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2020/04/compulsory-licensing-and-new-provisions-affecting-ip-holders-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-in-france-and-globally.pdf" target="_blank">France</a>, have already even strengthened legislation to make these measures easier to implement. </p>



<p>Usually seen as a last resort, there are very few cases of compulsory licensing of medicines. But one could make the case in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, explains Ceyhun Pehlivan, a lawyer at Linklaters’ Madrid office: Governments could say it's an appropriate option if the license holder can't produce enough vaccines or medicines. Opponents of compulsory licenses argue they would discourage companies from producing these kinds of products in the future, Pehlivan added. </p>



<p>Historically, compulsory licensing has certainly not proved an attractive option. Only once in WTO history has a developing country lacking production capabilities forced an export license onto a patent-holding country. In 2007, Rwanda sought to import antiretroviral HIV medicines from Canada — and Ottawa granted the license over a year after the initial ask.</p>



<p>There's another problem — possibly the Achilles' heel of the push for IP waivers and compulsory licenses: While granting a compulsory license may mean that another manufacturer can produce a drug or vaccine without being sued by the license holder, it doesn't give them the all-important know-how or technology transfer to actually make the drug. These are separate from patents and are particularly important for the manufacture of complex drugs, such as mRNA vaccines, which up until now, had never been made before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Geneva-based diplomat pointed to the know-how issue as a significant obstacle. “That’s the $1 million question,” the diplomat said.</p>



<p>One possible avenue is the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool#:~:text=The%20COVID%2D19%20Technology%20Access,knowledge%2C%20intellectual%20property%20and%20data." target="_blank">Technology Access Pool</a> (C-TAP), which was meant to become a source for open-access knowledge on COVID-19 science and technology. However, as yet, not a single patent-holding drugmaker has agreed to sign up.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>‘Guerilla war’ against IP rights&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Behind the spat at the WTO, a larger question looms: Is this an attempt to permanently override aspects of intellectual property rights that some countries disagree with?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can essentially see it as a play by two countries, India and South Africa, who never really liked the current intellectual property rights rules of the WTO,” said Simon Evenett, an economics professor at St. Gallen University in Switzerland. “I see it in a broader 25-year-long context of this sort of guerilla war against these rules.”</p>



<p>But for now, patent-defending countries are unlikely to let their guard down on intellectual property at the WTO, even during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost every major pharmaceutical exporter except India has objected to this,” Evenett said. “I don’t see that proposal going ahead, unless circumstances dramatically change.</p>



<p>"But that doesn’t mean that India and South Africa can’t act unilaterally," he added.</p>

				<p>If I could go back in time and give a younger me one piece of advice when starting my company, it would be - don't start a business, build a side project instead. Build it for fun, see where it goes, let curiosity be your carrot as opposed to the expectation of success being a stick.</p><p>Side projects are simple. In fact they're so simple that you work on them just for the fun of it. You get deep into it, with no expectations, let what you learn evolve what you do next and let the project basically pull itself out of you.</p><p>When you start a business there is an expectation of success attached to it, otherwise the business is a failure. You need to find a business model, figure out what your vision is and what the market size is. "Is it a big enough idea?" is often the question asked by friends, parents and investors. There's nothing more demotivating than talking about your business to a cynical aunt.</p><p>Secondly, you need to be able to sell your ideas to those around you, and do it without fear. The best way to shed the fear of appearing foolish is to actually do something foolish for the fun of it. Strangely, you'll find that everyone around you is a lot more encouraging in this scenario than if you set out claiming you're going to build a big business.</p><p>Big things are accomplished by the compounding effect of many foolish little things done over a long time. If you start off trying to do a big thing, you'll always feel unaccomplished because you're too focused on what you haven't achieved yet. Focus on the small things, work on little projects, make an app for your friends as a joke, file your aunt's taxes, write a blog, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/">build a shitty robot</a>. Keep doing that and just enjoy the process of building and creating things, and keep that child-like sense of curiosity alive. </p><p>The main reason for this is that you need to do the groundwork to prepare yourself to be receptive to opportunities when they come up. You never know when they will, but unless you are knee deep in something you love already, you just won't notice it.</p><blockquote>“You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy.

    <div>
      
      <p>by Dietrich Ayala on 2021-02-08</p>

      

      

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.ipfs.io/img/opera-ipfs-header.png" alt="IPFS in Opera Touch for iOS">
</p>

<p>In 2020 we announced a big moment for IPFS: The first official support of IPFS protocol addressing in a major browser, when <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-30-ipfs-in-opera-for-android/">Opera released IPFS support in their Android browser</a>. This was an important step in IPFS browser support generally, by building interest and momentum. We didn’t stop there, and we’ve got not just one… BUT TWO releases to share with you today!</p>

<p>First, Opera has now added support for IPFS addressing to Opera Touch, their iOS browser.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.ipfs.io/img/opera-ios-wikipedia-short.png" alt="A screenshot of Wikipedia on IPFS in Opera Touch">
</p>

<p>Second, support for IPFS addressing in Opera desktop browser for Windows, macOS, and Linux will be coming in their next release, currently planned for March 2021.</p>

<p>As a special surprise for EthDenver, you can download a preview build of Opera for desktop which has IPFS addressing support! Give it a spin at <a href="https://ethdenver2021.opera.com/">ethdenver2021.opera.com</a>.</p>

<p>With these releases, Opera will now support <code>ipfs://</code> and <code>ipns://</code> addressing across their browser product line on all major operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>First, install Opera Touch on your iOS device. If you’re reading this on an iOS device, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opera-touch-web-browser/id1411869974">click to install now</a>.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.ipfs.io/img/opera-ios-app-store-short.png" alt="Opera Touch in the iOS app store">
</p>

<p>Then you can open content using IPFS protocol addresses, like the <a href="ipns://blog.ipfs.io">blog you’re reading now</a>, <a href="ipns://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org">Wikipedia</a>, or this <a href="ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi">Persian room guardian</a> by <a href="https://www.anyabozartist.com/the-persian-cat">Anya Boz</a>. You can easily upload files to IPFS using the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/">IPFS desktop application</a> or <a href="https://share.ipfs.io/">Share.ipfs.io</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Opera Touch supports navigating to addresses for <code>ipfs://</code> and <code>ipns://</code> protocol schemes, which are handled by a remote HTTP gateway. By default the gateway used is <code>dweb.link</code>, which is operated by Protocol Labs. The ability to select a different gateway is coming in the next update of Opera Touch.</p>

<p>Native representation of IPFS addresses in browsers is important, even when the content is loaded from an HTTP gateway as IPFS URIs are resolved out of the box, without the need for any additional extensions or opt-in settings, which familiarizes users and developers with decentralized concepts of content-addressing and creates a path to readiness for when native nodes are available.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Opera desktop browser support for IPFS addressing will ship soon, and we’re discussing what additional features to add next to build on top of this foundation of universal addressing support across the Opera browser line. Have ideas for what you’d like to see in Opera next? Let us know on the <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.io/">IPFS forums</a>, or tweet your ideas to <a href="https://twitter.com/opera">@Opera</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ipfs">@IPFS</a> on Twitter!</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opera-touch-web-browser/id1411869974">Install Opera Touch on iOS now!</a></p>

he turn of the millennium brought a wave of improved 3D and CG technology that we've seen proliferate through fully animated properties as well as live action visual effects. This can be attributed to a mixture of things including an insatiable desire on the consumer side for higher quality CG content, a continuation of Moore's Law, and James Cameron.

<span>“</span>
<span>"When you're making a movie that costs $200 million… your target audience is people with a pulse and $15 - or even just $15."<br>- <a href="https://ew.com/article/2009/12/11/avatar-james-cameron-2/">-James Cameron, 2009</a></span>
<span>”</span>
</blockquote> <div><p>
James Cameron's obsession with technology, perfection, and thus, massive risk-taking in filmmaking has been well-documented. In 1977 Cameron quit his job as a truck driver and entered the film industry after seeing <i>Star Wars</i>. He worked his way up from a miniature model maker to special effects and design work, culminating in a special effects director role in 1982 (which he was fired from). Cameron had always been obsessed with science fiction and wrote the screenplay for <i>The Terminator (1984)</i> after dreaming about the story while he had food poisoning, eventually releasing the $6.5M budget film to an over $78M worldwide box office success.
</p><p>
After a string of successes, Cameron took the biggest risk of his career with <i>Titantic</i> in 1997. Cameron's perfection led to him deep-sea exploratory filming, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4bx0Y2Udg4">expensive large-scale sets</a>, and other boundary-pushing digital effects done by Digital Domain, a VFX company Cameron helped start in the early 1990s. <i>Titanic</i> became the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a budget that ballooned all the way to $200M. The bet paid off and <i>Titanic</i> went on to make $1.8B and win 11 Academy Awards.
</p><p>
In 1994 Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for an epic science fiction film that he planned to make after the completion of <i>Titanic</i> in 1997. He planned to release the film in late 1999 but after <i>Titanic</i>, he realized that the visual effects technology was not yet ready to achieve his grandiose vision of an entirely CG world with hybrid human-CG actors. Cameron would wait over 10 years (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/read-james-camerons-sworn-declaration-avatar-399979">or as he would later argue for legal sake, 50 years</a>) for the technology to catch up to make his dream into a reality, eventually beginning preliminary work on what would be known as <i>Avatar</i> in 2006.

<blockquote>
<span>“</span>
<span>"There's a term in Hollywood for Cameron's style of directing…They call this 'building the parachute on the way down.'" <br>
- Bruce Davis, Executive Director of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</span>
<span>”</span>
</blockquote> <div><p>
Cameron continued to push the envelope of technical possibilities in film across motion capture (or as Cameron would create, <i>performance capture</i>), real-time rendering, and CGI with <i>Avatar</i>.
</p><p>
Cameron wanted to improve upon the past decades worth of technological development by blending human actors into their CG characters, mapping their emotions in real-time, and allowing him to see how their acting performed in the entirely CG world of the film in real-time. To do so Cameron worked with Peter Jackson's Weta Digital to create a new device that would incorporate every facial movement into the hybrid CG/3D character with minimal post processing.
</p><p>
<i>"…the process of motion capture served only as a starting point for animators, who would finish the job with digital brush strokes. "Gollum's face was entirely animated by hand…King Kong was a third or so straight performance capture. It was never automatic." This time, Cameron wanted to keep the embellishment by animators to a minimum and let the actors drive their own performances." </i> <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a5067/4339455/"><b>- Joe Letteri, Weta Digital effects master</b></a></p></div>

</figure>
<div><p>
After seeing early renders of their first attempts, he complained about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> effects and Weta spent an entire year perfecting Cameron's invention with improved algorithms that would allow for raw motion capture data from the rig to render into a realistic, hybrid character. The results were groundbreaking.
</p><p>
Leading up to its release, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/media/09avatar.html">rumors were flying</a> about the film's near $300M budget (an additional $150M was spent on promotion) and concerns around any original story being able to reach the high bar for such a budget, even with Cameron attached. Avatar premiered on December 10th 2009 and went on to be the highest grossing film of all-time, doing $2.79B at the box office (<i>Avengers: Endgame</i> recently took 2nd place from <i>Titanic</i> at $2.77B).
</p><p>
Like <i>Toy Story</i> did for 3D Animation, <i>Avatar</i> is often considered one of the most important films in CGI technology history. As time has gone on, we've only seen these pioneers like Pixar and others continue to push the limits through the 2010s.&nbsp;
</p><p>
James Cameron is currently working on four consecutive sequels to <i>Avatar</i> due for release in 2020, 2021, 2024, and 2025, at a collective budget of over $1B.
</p><p>
What parachutes he is building on the way down is anyone's guess. </p></div>  <figure>

</figure> <div><p>
Since <i>Avatar</i>, we have seen a steady progress of CGI technology innovation. <i>The Lego Movie (2014)</i> was widely praised (ironically) for its photorealism of entirely CG lego characters. Earlier this year the internet recently collectively freaked out about <a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/pixar-then-now">the staggering progress</a> in physics simulation and photorealism for a <i>Toy Story 4 (2019)</i> cat. Pixar had been building towards this in public through simulations of hair physics and rendering since the creation of the hairy Sulley from <i>Monsters Inc.</i>, to <i>Ratatouille</i>'s <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/500MillionHairs/paper.pdf">simulation of hair</a> when Remy jumps in water, and through Merida from <i>Brave</i>'s large red hair. The team at Pixar has covered their technical progress across <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/Hair/paper.pdf">multiple</a> <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/CurlyHairA/paper.pdf">research</a> <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/SigAsia2015/paper.pdf">papers</a></p></div><figure>

</figure> 
<div><p>
Pixar has taken a similar approach when it came to modeling humans. The team rarely showed full humans in the original <i>Toy Story</i>, but as their technical abilities progressed through their next four films from 1995-2004, they were able to fully feature humans for the first time with <i>The Incredibles'</i> release in November 2004.

<figcaption>The Lion King is entirely done via CGI</figcaption>
</figure> 
<div><p>
Later this year we'll see the live action remake of <i>The Lion King (2019)</i> (as Disney continues to trot out once profitable or popular 2D animated film remakes) which has started a debate about what constitutes "live action" anymore.
</p><p>
While <i>The Lion King</i> is no longer 2D animated, it is entirely done via CGI as tech has continued to blur the lines between animation and live action, or as Sean Bailey, President of Production at Walt Disney Studios put it:
</p></div>
<blockquote>
<span>“</span>
<span>"It is a new form of filmmaking. Historical definitions don't work. It uses some techniques that would traditionally be called animation, and other techniques that would traditionally be called live action. It is an evolution of the technology Jon used in Jungle Book.</span>
<span>”</span>
</blockquote> <div><p>
While these properties all continue to push the envelope on blurring the lines between what's real or not, perhaps none has done so more aggressively than Netflix's series of shorts <i>Love Death and Robots (2019)</i>.
</p><p>
Led by David Fincher and Tim Miller, LDR is a tour de force of state-of-the-art and experimental animation, featuring 13 studios and animators from nine countries. </p></div>

<p>
One of the shorts, <i>Lucky 13</i>, has been applauded for its incredible photorealistic CG animation which featured face scanning, a proprietary facial rig, and intense photorealistic environments which allowed the team to "cross the uncanny valley". </p>

<div><p>
Another episode titled <i>The Witness</i>, utilized a piece of software from the fashion industry (along with keyframing) to create an aesthetic and physics surrounding clothing that led the internet to accuse the filmmakers of lying about their lack of use of motion capture and live action actors. Creator Alberto Mielgo described it in detail below: </p><p> 
<i>"The characters were animated naked, and then we started putting clothes on top…We used a software called Marvellous Designer. It's a fashion software that was originally created to help designers to create their clothes, but it has a brilliant way of simulating clothes. However, the program is not ready for a pipeline inside of it, so it's not the main program that people use. It's my favorite for the look of it, and I pushed my team to use it. We created a pipeline that doesn't actually exist, and that's why people are in shock because they've never seen clothes move that well." </i> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/02/how-netflixs-love-death-robots-created-that-eye-popping-animation">IGN, 2019</a></p><p>
<i>LDR</i> wasn't without its issues, specifically surrounding <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/love-death-and-robots-review-netflix">claims of sexism</a>, excessive nudity, as well as complaints about the actual stories. Despite these shortcomings it was the result of something larger happening within animation; a shifting distribution model, expansion of capital, and perhaps more opportunity for experimentation.&nbsp;
</p><p>
Today's over-the-top (OTT) players are the 10,000 pound gorillas in the room, and while the animation throne of tomorrow could start with Netflix and possibly end with Disney+, two decades before <i>BoJack Horseman</i> was a twinkle in Netflix's eye, we had Cartoon Network. </p></div>

After Turner Broadcasting acquired a portfolio of animation IP from MGM/United Artists as well as the entire Hanna-Barbera catalogue for $320M in 1991, they created Cartoon Network. The creation of Cartoon Network in 1992 helped push forward the idea of single-genre …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Normal situations should not be warnings (especially not repeated ones)</h2>

	<p><small>February  9, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often (or really, too often), people with good intentions
build a program that looks at some things or does some things, and
they decide to have that program emit warnings or set status results
if things are not quite perfect and as expected. This is a mistake,
and it makes system administrators who have to deal with the program
unhappy. <strong>An ordinary system configuration should not cause a
program to raise warnings or error markers</strong>, even if it doesn't
allow all of the things that a program is capable of doing (or that
the program wants to do by default).  In addition, every warning
should be rate-limited in any situation that can plausibly emit
them regularly.</p>

<p>That all sounds abstract, so let's make it concrete with some
examples drawn from the very latest version (1.1.0) of the <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter">host agent</a>. The host agent gathers
a bunch of information from your system, which is separated into a
bunch of 'collectors' (one for each sort of information). Collectors
may be enabled or disabled by default, and as part of the metrics
that the host agent emits it can report if a particular collector
said that it failed (what consitutes 'failure' is up to the collector
to decide).</p>

<p>The host agent has collectors for a number of Linux filesystem types
(such as XFS, Btrfs, and ZFS), for networking technologies such as
Fibrechannel and Infiniband, and for network stack information such
as IP filtering connection tracking ('conntrack'), among other
collectors. All of the collectors I've named are enabled by default.
Naturally, many systems do not actually have XFS, Btrfs, or ZFS
filesystems, or Infiniband networking, or any 'conntrack' state.
Unfortunately, of these enabled by default collectors, zfs, infiniband,
fibrechannel, and conntrack all generate metrics reporting a collector
failure on Linux servers that don't use those respective technologies.
Without advance knowledge of the specific configuration of every
server you monitor, this makes it impossible to tell the difference
between a machine that doesn't have one of those things and a real
collector failure on a machine that does have one and so should be
successfully collecting information about them. But at least these
failures only show up in the generated metrics. At least two
collectors in 1.1.0 do worse by emitting actual warnings into the
host agent's logs.</p>

<p>The first collector is for Linux's new <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html">pressure stall information</a>. This
is valuable information but of course is only supported on recent
kernels, which means recent versions from Linux distributions (so,
for example, both Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7 use kernels without
this information). However, if the host agent's 'pressure' collector
can't find the /proc files it expects, it doesn't just report a
collector failure, it emits an error message:</p>

<blockquote><pre>level=error ts=2021-02-08T19:42:48.048Z caller=collector.go:161 msg="collector failed" name=pressure duration_seconds=0.073142059 err="failed to retrieve pressure stats: psi_stats: unavailable for cpu"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>At least you can disable this collector on older kernels, and automate
that with a cover script that checks for /proc/pressure and disables the
pressure collector if it's not there.</p>

<p>The second collector is for ZFS metrics. In addition to a large
amount of regular ZFS statistics, recent versions of <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS on Linux</a> expose kernel information about the overall
health of each ZFS pool on the system. This was introduced in ZFS
on Linux version 0.8.0, which is more recent that the version of
ZoL that is included in, for example, Ubuntu 18.04. Unfortunately,
in version 1.1.0 the Prometheus host agent ZFS collector insists
on this overall health information being present; if it isn't, the
collector emits a warning:</p>

<blockquote><pre>level=warn ts=2021-02-09T01:14:09.074Z caller=zfs_linux.go:125 collector=zfs msg="Not found pool state files"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this is only part of the ZFS collector's activity, you can't
disable just this pool state collection. Your only options are to either
disable the entire collector, losing all ZFS metrics on say <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSetupIII">your
Ubuntu 18.04 ZFS fileservers</a>, or have
frequent warnings flood your logs. Or you can take the third path of
not using version 1.1.0 of the host agent.</p>

<p>(Neither the pressure collector nor the ZFS collector rate-limit
these error and warning messages. Instead one such message will be
emitted every time the host agent is polled, which is often as
frequently as once every fifteen or even every ten seconds.)</p>

February 9, 2021 | https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Today we are pleased to introduce Polar Signals <strong>Continuous Profiler</strong>, an open source based SaaS for Continuous Profiling. Profiling has long been a tool in the developer's toolbox. It allows CPU, memory, I/O usage and more to be understood down to a line of code. It is an immensely valuable tool for debugging. <em>Continuous profiling</em> is the act of taking profiles of programs in a systematic way. Polar Signals Continuous Profiler, based on the open source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/conprof/conprof">Conprof</a> project, collects, stores and makes <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof</a> profiles available to be queried over time. This is useful in post-mortem analysis, when it is too late to take measurements. In short, Continuous Profiling allows for profiling to be systematic, instead of a search for the needle in the haystack.</p><h3>Traditional Workflow</h3><p>To understand how Polar Signals Continuous Profiler works, and why we built it, let's go through the traditional workflow of what a developer goes through when profiling. A typical scenario starts out with either a production incident or the intent to optimize a piece of code. Optimization is often driven by the intention to make a system faster, or for example to reduce resource usage in order to save cost.</p><p>Incidents caused by running out of memory (OOMKill) can be a very stressful situation, the process has already been killed by the operating system, and so it is not possible to obtain profiles about the situation anymore. Obtaining profiles often requires SSHing onto production machines and capturing profiles manually. This is problematic for security and auditability, besides that, it is also easy to make mistakes when SSHing in production environments. Above all, profiling manually in this fashion is a search for the needle in the haystack. It is impossible to know whether a situation is reproducible in a way that allows capturing the right data.</p><h3>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Workflow</h3><p>The goal of Polar Signals Continuous Profiler is to turn the search for the right data into a systematic one. With Polar Signals Continuous Profiler, profiles are captured periodically, ensuring that profiles are available for any moment in time, that way the right data is always only a search away. This way, when a process ran out of memory, a latency spike happens or when we want to start optimize code, the data is already available! This saves time obtaining the data manually, but more importantly the <em>right</em> data is already captured - no need to wait or try and reproduce a past situation.</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/query-over-time.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Query Over Time"><p>Once the data is available over time, new useful workflows are unlocked. Take the scenario of optimizing a piece of code for reducing resource usage for example. A profile of a particular moment of time is useful, but it is only representative of that exact moment in time. When the data is collected over time, it can for example be summarized into a single report, making it not only representative of that moment of time, but the entire time range. We have found this to be particularly useful to summarize performance characteristics of an entire version of code.</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/merge.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Merge Feature"><p>And last but not least, not only is the data available over time, but also across deployment-rollouts. It allows answering questions that thus far have been notoriously difficult to answer, which boils down to "What changed in my code, that caused a change in performance?" This typically originates from one of two questions. Why did our resource usage increase? And did my optimization changes work?</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/compare.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Compare Feature"><p>To sum up, using Polar Signals Continuous Profiler an organization can:</p><ol><li>Save money on their cloud bill, by optimizing resource usage.</li><li>Boost conversion rate, by improving application latency.</li><li>Save time and stress, by make systems more reliable.</li></ol><h3>How Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Works</h3><p>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler periodically scrapes <a href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof</a> compatible profiles from HTTP endpoints. We are launching with support for <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, which supports profiling in pprof format via its standard library. Many programs written in Go already have these endpoints, so organizations that already use Go are likely to not need any changes to their code to start using Polar Signals Continuous Profiler! Rust, Python, NodeJS and JVM are already on the roadmap, but let us know what languages and runtimes you would like to see!</p><p>The collector is configured to discover targets using service discovery, this happens to be identical to <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus'</a> service discovery, so organizations already using Prometheus can re-use configuration from it! And if not, we have automated deployment and configuration strategies prepared for you, for example to get started on Kubernetes seamlessly.</p><p>The collector regularly scrapes the HTTP endpoints and sends the results to Polar Signals. Once received by Polar Signals the exploration for improvements can start!</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler is in private beta starting today! We are working hard to bring it to General Availability. We are in the process of onboarding users to our private beta, and if you want to participate, request access:</p></article></div>]]>

First Wave Antiracism battled slavery and segregation. Second Wave Antiracism, in the 1970s and 1980s, battled racist attitudes and taught America that being racist was a flaw. Third Wave Antiracism, becoming mainstream in the 2010s, teaches that racism is baked into the structure of society, so whites’ “complicity” in living within it constitutes racism itself, while for black people, grappling with the racism surrounding them is the totality of experience and must condition exquisite sensitivity toward them, including a suspension of standards of achievement and conduct.</p><p>Third Wave Antiracist tenets, stated clearly and placed in simple oppositions, translate into nothing whatsoever:</p><ol><li><p>When black people say you have insulted them, apologize with profound sincerity and guilt. <strong>But </strong>don’t put black people in a position where you expect them to forgive you. They have dealt with too much to be expected to.</p></li><li><p>Black people are a conglomeration of disparate individuals. “Black culture” is code for “pathological, primitive ghetto people.” <strong>But </strong>don’t expect black people to assimilate to “white” social norms because black people have a culture of their own.</p></li><li><p>Silence about racism is violence. <strong>But </strong>elevate the voices of the oppressed over your own.</p></li><li><p>You must strive eternally to understand the experiences of black people. <strong>But </strong>you can never understand what it is to be black, and if you think you do you’re a racist.</p></li><li><p>Show interest in multiculturalism.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>do not culturally appropriate. What is not your culture is not for you, and you may not try it or do it. But—if you aren’t nevertheless <em>interested</em> in it, you are a racist.</p></li><li><p>Support black people in creating their own spaces and stay out of them. <strong>But </strong>seek to have black friends. If you don’t have any, you’re a racist. And if you claim any, they’d better be <em>good</em> friends—in their private spaces, you aren’t allowed in.</p></li><li><p>When whites move away from&nbsp;black neighborhoods, it’s white flight.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>when whites move into black neighborhoods, it’s gentrification, even when they pay black residents generously for their houses.</p></li><li><p>If you’re white and only date white people, you’re a racist. <strong>But </strong>if you’re white and date a black person you are, if only deep down, exotifying an “other.”</p></li><li><p>Black people cannot be held accountable for everything every black person does. <strong>But </strong>all whites must acknowledge their personal complicity in the perfidy throughout history of “whiteness.”</p></li><li><p>Black students must be admitted to schools via adjusted grade and test score standards to ensure a representative number of them and foster a diversity of views in classrooms. <strong>But </strong>it is racist to assume a black student was admitted to a school via racial preferences, and racist to expect them to represent the “diverse” view in classroom discussions.</p></li></ol><p>I suspect that deep down, most know that none of this catechism makes any sense. Less obvious is that it was not even composed with logic in mind. The self-contradiction of these tenets is crucial, in revealing that Third Wave Antiracism is not a philosophy but a religion. </p><p>The revelation of racism is, itself and alone, the point, the intention, of this curriculum. As such, the fact that if you think a little, the tenets cancel one another out, is considered trivial. That they serve their true purpose of revealing people as bigots is paramount—sacrosanct, as it were. Third Wave Antiracism’s needlepoint homily <em>par excellence</em> is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Battling power relations and their discriminatory effects must be the central focus of all human endeavor, be it intellectual, moral, civic or artistic. Those who resist this focus, or even evidence insufficient adherence to it, must be sharply condemned, deprived of influence, and ostracized.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism is losing innocent people jobs.</strong> It is coloring, detouring and sometimes strangling academic inquiry. It forces us to render a great deal of our public discussion of urgent issues in doubletalk any 10-year-old can see through. It forces us to start teaching our actual 10-year-olds, in order to hold them off from spoiling the show in that way, to believe in sophistry in the name of enlightenment. On that, Third Wave Antiracism guru Ibram X. Kendi has written a book on how to raise antiracist children called <em>Antiracist Baby</em>. You couldn’t imagine it better: Are we in a Christopher Guest movie? This and so much else is a sign that Third Wave Antiracism forces us to pretend that performance art is politics. It forces us to spend endless amounts of time listening to nonsense presented as wisdom, and pretend to like it.</p><p>I write this viscerally driven by the fact that all of this supposed wisdom is founded in an ideology under which white people calling themselves our saviors make black people look like the dumbest, weakest, most self-indulgent human beings in the history of our species, and teach black people to revel in that status and cherish it as making us special. Talking of <em>Antiracist Baby</em>, I am especially dismayed at the idea of this indoctrination infecting my daughters’ sense of self. I can’t always be with them, and this anti-humanist ideology may seep into their school curriculum. I shudder at the thought: teachers with eyes shining at the prospect of showing their antiracism by teaching my daughters that they are poster children rather than individuals. </p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates in <em>Between the World and Me</em> wanted to teach his son that America is set against him; I want to teach my kids the reality of their lives in the 21st&nbsp;rather than early-to-mid-20th century. Lord forbid my daughters internalize a pathetic—yes, absolutely pathetic in all of the resonances of that word—sense that what makes them interesting is what other people think of them, or don’t.</p><p>Many will see me as traitorous in writing this as a black person. They will not understand that I see myself as serving my race by writing it. One of the grimmest tragedies of how this perversion of sociopolitics makes us think (or, not think) is that it will bar more than a few black readers from understanding that I am calling for them to be treated with true dignity. However, they and everyone else should also realize: I know quite well that white readers will be more likely to hear out views like this when written by a black person, and consider it nothing less than my duty as a black person to write it.</p><p>A white version of this would be blithely dismissed as racist. I will be dismissed instead as self-hating by a certain crowd. But frankly, they won’t really mean it, and anyone who gets through <a href="https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists">my new book</a> on this subject, which I am now publishing in serial, will see that whatever traits I harbor, hating myself or being ashamed of being black is not one of them. And we shall move on. As in, to realizing that what I am documenting matters, and matters deeply. Namely, that America’s sense of what it is to be intellectual, moral, or artistic; what it is to educate a child; what it is to foster justice; what is to express oneself properly; what it is to be a nation—all is being refounded upon a religion. </p><p>This is directly antithetical to the very foundations of the American experiment. Religion has no place in the classroom, in the halls of ivy, in our codes of ethics, or in deciding how we express ourselves, and almost all of us spontaneously understand that and see any misunderstanding of the premise as backward. Yet since about 2015, a peculiar contingent has been slowly headlocking us into making an exception, supposing that this new religion is so incontestably good, so gorgeously surpassing millennia of brilliant philosophers’ attempts to identify the ultimate morality, that we can only bow down in humble acquiescence.</p><p>But a new religion in the guise of world progress is not an advance; it is a detour. It is not altruism; it is self-help. It is not sunlight; it is fungus. It’s time it became ordinary to call it for what it is and stop cowering before it, letting it make people so much less than they—black and everything else—could be.</p><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism exploits modern Americans’ fear</strong> of being thought racist, using this to promulgate an obsessive, self-involved, totalitarian and unnecessary kind of cultural reprogramming. One could be excused for thinking this glowering kabuki is a continuation of the Civil Rights efforts of yore, the only kind of new antiracism there could be. Its adherents preach with such contemptuous indignation, and are now situated in the most prestigious and influential institutions in the land—on their good days they can seem awfully “correct.”</p><p>However, there is nothing correct about the essence of American thought and culture being transplanted into the soil of a religious faith. Some will go as far as to own up to it being a religion, and wonder why we can’t just accept it as our new national creed. The problem is that on matters of societal procedure and priorities, the adherents of this religion—true to the very nature of religion—cannot be reasoned with. They are, in this, medievals with lattes.</p><p>We need not wonder what the basic objections will be: Third Wave Antiracism isn’t really a religion; I am oversimplifying; I shouldn’t write this without being a theologian; it is a religion but it’s a good one; and so on. I will get all of that out of the way as we go on, and then offer some genuine solutions. But first, what this is not.</p><ol><li><p><em>It is not an argument against protest.</em> I am not arguing against the basic premises of Black Lives Matter, although I have had my differences with some of its offshoot developments. I am not arguing that the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s would have been better off sticking to quiet negotiations. I am not arguing against the left. I am arguing against a particular strain of the left that has come to exert a grievous influence over American institutions, to the point that we are beginning to …</p></li></ol></div></div>

  <div>
    <section>  </section> <string></string> <section><p>If you haven't worked in a typed language before, it may not be obvious at first the power that it brings.  This article will show you how to leverage the type system to make your code easier to use and more reusable.</p> <h4>Target Audience</h4> <p>This article is aimed at developers that are new to Go and have little to no Go experience.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <p>For this article, we will look at how to handle <code language="plain">categorical</code> data.  In this case, specifically how to handle the <code language="plain">genre</code> category for classifying a book.</p> <p>To start, we'll define a data structure for a <code language="plain">Book</code> , in which we'll want to categorize it via the <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v1/books.go">package books

type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre string
}</code></pre>   <p>Now that we have the book defined, let's go ahead and define some constants for <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v1/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = "Adventure"
	Comic         = "Comic"
	Crime         = "Crime"
	Fiction       = "Fiction"
	Fantasy       = "Fantasy"
	Historical    = "Historical"
	Horror        = "Horror"
	Magic         = "Magic"
	Mystery       = "Mystery"
	Philosophical = "Philosophical"
	Political     = "Political"
	Romance       = "Romance"
	Science       = "Science"
	Superhero     = "Superhero"
	Thriller      = "Thriller"
	Western       = "Western"
)</code></pre>   <p>So far, this seems fine.  However, the <code language="plain">genre</code> constants are strings.  While this makes for a very "humanized" way of reading the code, it's not very efficient as it pertains to a computer program.  Strings will take up more storage space, and more memory in the program (not to mention if we stored millions of data records to a database).  As such, we really want to use a smaller data type to represent this data.</p> <p>In Go, one way we can do this is to create constants that are based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v2/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = 1
	Comic         = 2
	Crime         = 3
	Fiction       = 4
	Fantasy       = 5
	Historical    = 6
	Horror        = 7
	Magic         = 8
	Mystery       = 9
	Philosophical = 10
	Political     = 11
	Romance       = 12
	Science       = 13
	Superhero     = 14
	Thriller      = 15
	Western       = 16
)</code></pre>   <p>We also need to change the <code language="plain">Book</code> structure to now represent <code language="plain">Genre</code> as an int:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v2/books.go">type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre int
}</code></pre>   <p>While we now have a more effecient memory model for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , it's not as "human" friendly.  If I print out the value of a <code language="plain">Book</code> , we now just get an integer value.  To show this, we'll write a quick test showing the output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">package books

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre, 8; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %d, exp %d", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>And here is the output.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">$ go test -v ./...
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:14: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:8}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/gopherguides/corp/_blog/types/leveraging-types/src/v2     (cached)</code></pre>   <p>Notice that the <code language="plain">Genre</code> just shows a value of <code language="plain">8</code> .  Any time we debug the code, or write a report, etc, we now need to figure out what <code language="plain">8</code> actually represents for a human being.</p> <p>To do this, we can write a helper function that takes the <code language="plain">Genre</code> value, and determines what the "human" representation should be:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v2/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case 1:
		return "Adventure"
	case 2:
		return "Comic"
	case 3:
		return "Crime"
	case 4:
		return "Fiction"
	case 5:
		return "Fantasy"
	case 6:
		return "Historical"
	case 7:
		return "Horror"
	case 8:
		return "Magic"
	case 9:
		return "Mystery"
	case 10:
		return "Philosophical"
	case 11:
		return "Political"
	case 12:
		return "Romance"
	case 13:
		return "Science"
	case 14:
		return "Superhero"
	case 15:
		return "Thriller"
	case 16:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <h2>A Better Way</h2> <p>While all the above code works fine, it's really missing some key points.</p> <ul><li><p>If a value for a <code language="plain">Genre</code> has to change in the future, we not only have to change the constant value, but we also have to update the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  If we don't, this will create a bug in our code.</p></li> <li><p>We aren't leveraging the type system to encapsulate this behavior for <code language="plain">Genre</code> .  We'll show you what we mean by that shortly.</p></li></ul> <p>The first thing we really need to do is write a more resilient <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  What we mean by resilient is that even if the value of the <code language="plain">Genre</code> constant changes in the future, the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function will not need to change.</p> <p>The correct way to do that is no longer use hard coded values, but use the value of the constant themselves:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v3/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Ok, that's much cleaner (and readable), but we still haven't solved the fact that when we print it out, it shows a data value ( <code language="plain">int</code> ), and not a "human" readable value.</p> <h2>Types to the Rescue</h2> <p>Instead of using a generic <code language="plain">int</code> type for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , we can create our own type based on an existing type.  In this case, we'll create a new type called <code language="plain">Genre</code> based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v4/books.go">type Genre int</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll define our constants as <code language="plain">Genre</code> types:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="constants" src="./src/v4/books.go">const (
	Adventure     Genre = 1
	Comic         Genre = 2
	Crime         Genre = 3
	Fiction       Genre = 4
	Fantasy       Genre = 5
	Historical    Genre = 6
	Horror        Genre = 7
	Magic         Genre = 8
	Mystery       Genre = 9
	Philosophical Genre = 10
	Political     Genre = 11
	Romance       Genre = 12
	Science       Genre = 13
	Superhero     Genre = 14
	Thriller      Genre = 15
	Western       Genre = 16
)</code></pre>   <p>So far, the code doesn't really feel different.  However, now that <code language="plain">Genre</code> is it's own type, we can add methods to it.  This allows us to encapsulate the "human" behavior we want to the type, and not as a generic function.</p> <p>To do this, we'll add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to the <code language="plain">Genre</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v4/books.go">func (g Genre) String() string {
	switch g {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll be able to use the <code language="plain">String</code> method when we want to see what the "human" value of a <code language="plain">Genre</code> is:</p> <pre><code language="go">b := Book{
	ID:    1,
	Name:  "All About Go",
	Genre: Magic,
}
fmt.Println(b.Genre.String())</code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="sh">Magic</code></pre> <h2>Magic Formatting</h2> <p>In Go, if you add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to any type, the <code language="plain">fmt</code> package will now use your <code language="plain">String</code> method to "pretty print" the representation of your type.  Because of this, we will now see that if we print out the <code language="plain">book</code> in our tests, we get a "human-readable" <code language="plain">Genre</code> as well:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre.String(), "Magic"; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %q, exp %q", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">$ go test -v -run=TestGenre -count=1 .
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:16: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:Magic}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      book    0.059s</code></pre>   <p>We now see the value for <code language="plain">Genre</code> in the printed output is <code language="plain">Magic</code> , and not <code language="plain">8</code> .

<p><em><strong>Abstract : </strong><span lang="en">In this post we describe the construction of a small amateur radio telescope operating at the frequency of 11.2 GHz. The construction of the radio telescope takes advantage of the satellite TV market which has made it easy and cheap to find parabolic reflector antennas with relative illuminator (feed horn) and LNB block (low noise amplifier-frequency converter). The performances of a similar instrument are naturally rather limited, however they still allow to make interesting observations of some of the most intense radio sources.</span></em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Radio astronomy is a difficult and fascinating science. It requires the use of bulky and expensive antennas, uses sophisticated radio-electronic technologies and sophisticated algorithms for signal processing. At first glance it would seem completely beyond the reach of an “amateur”. In reality it is possible to make interesting radio astronomical observations even at an amateur level.<br>
On our site we have already described some radio astronomy projects for specific applications:</p>

</ul>
<p>Now we want to try to make an “amateur” radio telescope based on the principle of the <strong>radiometer</strong>. This is certainly not the place to give detailed information on radio astronomy and radio telescopes (there is a lot of information on the net and specific texts), so we limit ourselves to providing some hints on the main points that guided us in the construction of the radio telescope.</p>
<p>Radio astronomy studies celestial bodies by analyzing the radio waves emitted by objects in the sky: any object emits electromagnetic waves through various physical processes (thermal and non-thermal), these waves are picked up by the antenna and analyzed with appropriate instruments: in general the characteristics of the captured signal are no different from those that characterize a <strong>broad spectrum electrical noise</strong>. The purpose of the radio telescope is to pick up this radiation and measure the signal strength, such an instrument is called a radiometer. To be precise, we speak of power per unit area and per unit of bandwidth and is expressed in Jansky&nbsp;: <strong>1Jy = 10<sup>-26</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> Hz</strong>.</p>
<p>The range of radio frequencies useful for radio astronomy observations is between <strong>20 MHz</strong> and about <strong>20 GHz</strong>: below 20 MHz there is absorption by the ionosphere, above 20 GHz there is absorption by of the gases present in the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">To choose the most suitable frequency band for an amateur radio telescope we must make a compromise between the observation possibilities and the cost and feasibility constraints. The frequency spectrum of the radio-source emissions depends on the underlying physical process: for “thermal” emissions such as the sun or the moon, the intensity follows the <strong>law of the black body</strong> with maximums at high frequencies (according to the approximation of Rayleigh-Jeans<strong> I ∝ 1/λ<sup>4</sup></strong>), while for non-thermal emissions (for example synchrotron emission) the maximums are at lower frequencies, as can be seen in the graph below which shows the intensity of some radio sources as a function of frequency.</span><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png"><img data-attachment-id="14927" data-permalink="https://physicsopenlab.org/2020/10/10/un-semplice-radiotelescopio-a-11-2-ghz/radiosorgenti/" data-orig-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" data-orig-size="658,756" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="radiosorgenti" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti-261x300.png" data-large-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" loading="lazy" src="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" alt="" width="450" height="515"></a></p>
<p>As we know the dimensions of the antenna are related to the wavelength of the radiation to be received, furthermore our antenna must be sufficiently directive, otherwise it would be practically useless: this means that to receive frequencies below 1 GHz the dimensions of the antenna should be significantly greater than 1m: large antennas are expensive and difficult to move.<br>
Another aspect to consider is external radio interference. The ether, especially in the city, is now saturated with transmissions and RF signals from the most heterogeneous origin: radio and TV broadcasting, cellular networks, WiFi networks, disturbances from power lines, etc …. Not having the possibility to install the radio telescope in “quiet” places we must choose a frequency band that is not too disturbed.</p>
<p>For the reasons described above, the choice is almost obligatory: the <strong>10-12 GHz frequency band</strong> is the one that seems most suitable for an amateur project like ours. At these frequencies, parabolic reflector antennas and devices designed for satellite television can be re-used. The costs of the equipment are affordable, the spatial resolution of the antenna is quite good and the interference is low (basically broadcasting satellites) and easily avoidable.<br>
Working at lower frequencies would make it possible to easily receive more radio sources but with a considerable increase in terms of costs, not to mention the problem of interference.</p>
<h3>Parabolic Dish Antenna</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The antenna we found on the second-hand market is a <strong>prime focus dish</strong> with a diameter of 120 cm. For radio astronomy applications it is better that the dish is of the prime focus type: in these antennas the feed horn is placed in the focus of the dish. In offset-type dishes, the feed-horn is not placed in the center but on the side, this type has constructive advantages but is more difficult to aim to the source than the prime focus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione">For this antenna we can calculate the gain and the directivity intended as half power band width HPBW (half power band width) :</p>
<p><strong>G = η*(π*D/λ) = 40 dB</strong></p>
<p><strong>HPBW = 65*λ/D = 1.45°</strong></p>
<p>Where<br>
<strong>η : efficiency = 0.5</strong><br>
<strong>D : diameter = 120 cm</strong><br>
<strong>λ : wavelength = 2.68 cm (correspond to 11.2 GHz)</strong></p>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The images below show the antenna and the metal structure used for manual movement.</span></p>

<h3>LNB</h3>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The first component of the system is the converter-amplifier block, the so-called <strong>LNB</strong>. This is the most important component because system performance largely depends on it. Our system receives in the 10-12 GHz band, at these frequencies the use of cables is problematic, for this reason the LNB block provides for a frequency down conversion in a lower band so that normal coaxial cables can be used.<br>
</span><span lang="en">The following image shows the basic scheme of the LNB block: there is a first <strong>RF amplification stage</strong>, followed by the mixer which multiplies the RF signal with the signal generated by a <strong>local oscillator (LO)</strong>. The resulting signal contains the sum and difference frequencies, the next filter eliminates the high frequency sum components to let pass only the frequencies in the band of interest, called <strong>intermediate frequencies (IF)</strong>, which are further amplified by another amplifier stage. In practice it is a heterodyne scheme, in which the frequency of the local oscillator is fixed.</span></p>

<p>The LNB block we use is<strong> Invacom’s SNF-031</strong> model which has<strong> low noise</strong> and <strong>good stability</strong> of the gain parameters with respect to variations in operating temperature. The actual antenna is located inside the waveguide which has a C120 flange on the outside to which the feed horn is fixed, which has the task of collecting the waves reflected by the dish and conveying them to the inside the waveguide.</p>
<p>LNB features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating frequency band : 10.7 – 12.75 GHz</li>
<li>Intermediate frequencies (IF) : 950 – 2150 MHz, LO = 9.75 GHz</li>
<li><strong>Noise Figure NF = 0.3 dB</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gain G = 50 – 60 dB</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Receiver</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The receiver consists of the few components, shown in the following image: there is a bias-T for feeding the LNB block, a bandpass filter centered at 1420 MHZ, a wide-band amplifier and the <strong>Airspy R2 SDR receiver</strong>. The “hardware” part has the function of limiting the receiving band and giving the signal a second amplification after the LNB stage. The signal is then acquired by Airspy and subsequently processed for the determination of the total power using <strong>GNURadio</strong> software. The <strong>radiometer</strong> function is practically realized through software.</span></p>

<p><strong>Features of our receiver :</strong><br>
Frequency Band = 80 MHz<br>
G<sub>LNB</sub> = 55 dB ; NF<sub>LNB</sub> = 0.3 dB<br>
G<sub>Filter</sub> = 3.5 dB (insertion loss)<br>
G<sub>Ampli</sub> = 15 dB ; NF<sub>Ampli</sub> = 0.75 dB<br>
<strong>Gain : G<sub>LNB</sub> – G<sub>Filter</sub> + G<sub>Ampli</sub> = 55 -3.5 +15 = 66.5 dB</strong><br>
<strong>Noise Figure : F = F<sub>LNB</sub> + (F<sub>Ampli</sub> – 1)/G<sub>LNB</sub> = 0.3 dB<br>
T<sub>e</sub> = (F – 1) * T<sub>0</sub> = 20.3 °K (Receiver equivalent temperature)</strong></p>
<h4>Bias-T</h4>
<p>The Bias-T has the function of “injecting” the supply voltage to the LNB block along the coaxial cable. In practice it is a simple circuit with a coupling capacitor to filter the DC component towards the RF side and an inductance at the DC input. Obtained on eBay, it can be easily self-built but attention must be paid to the “RF” quality of the components and the shielding.</p>

<h4>1420 MHz Band Pass Filter</h4>
<p>This filter is dedicated to amateur radioastronomers interested in the hydrogen line observations. It uses the TA2494A SAW component and measures only 50 x 10mm. It features edge pads for an easy soldering of a RF shield. Insertion loss is typically less than 3.5dB and bandwith 80MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Data</strong> :<br>
Center Frequency <strong>1420MHz</strong><br>
Usable Bandpass <strong>1380-1460MHz</strong><br>
Insertion Loss, 1380 to 1460 MHz <strong>3.5dB</strong><br>
Amplitude Ripple, 1380 to 1460 MHz 1.0 dBpp<br>
VSWR, 1380 &nbsp;to 1420 MHz 1.9:1<br>
Rejection referenced to 0dB :<br>
DC to 1300 MHz 28dB<br>
1550 to 3000 MHz 30dB<br>
Impedance 50Ω<br>
Maximum Input Power Level 10 dBm</p>
<p>In the images below we show the unit and its frequency response. We have soldered two wires between the SMA female headers and we wrapped the filter with aluminum tape in order to shield the filter.</p>

<h4>Wideband Amplifier</h4>
<p>This unit HAB-FLTNOSAW built by UPUTRONICS is a preamp designed to go between a software defined radio receiver and an antenna. The LNA used inside is a MiniCircuits PSA4-5043. This particular model has the SAW filter removed to cover the 0.1MHz to 4GHz. There are 2 options for powering the unit : either by the USB header or via bias-tee. Devices such as the Airspy can enable bias-tee and power the device. Alternatively any mini USB cable can be used to power the device. We chose to power the unit via USB line.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Data</strong> :<br>
Gain 24db @ 100MHz -&gt; <strong>15.2db @ 1415MHz</strong><br>
<strong>NF 0.75dB</strong><br>
Supply Voltage USB or Bias tee 5V</p>

Picovoice enables creating voice experiences similar to Alexa that can run on-device, without requiring constant connectivity. Picovoice’s edge AI respects user privacy, incurs minimal latency, and provides superior reliability. Picovoice’s offline voice recognition keeps all voice data on the device and hence is intrinsically GDPR and HIPAA compliant.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="issue">
  <p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l1WYFHoNxsPt3z45j8/giphy.gif"></p><p><strong>Product Managers are&nbsp;Detectives</strong></p>

<p>Last year, I wrote an article about the <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/product-management-skills">top skills you need to succeed as a Product Manager</a>. It covers the usual suspects: requirements gathering, sprint planning, communication, etc. and I stand by&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>But I left something out, something that will make you <em>indispensable</em>: detective&nbsp;skills.</p>

<p><strong>Walking the (bug)&nbsp;beat</strong></p>

<p>As part of my team’s triage process, Product Managers review incoming bugs and support issues, before assigning them to Engineering. I like this, because a lot of issues can be addressed with an <span>API</span> call, a link to the documentation, or a kind, but firm&nbsp;no.</p>

<p>When I can’t defer, close, or ignore an issue, I investigate it, with a goal of identifying the root cause and potential solutions. Once I can reliably replicate and document the problem, I can give Engineering the full story they need to fix&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>If you hand off an issue too early, before you understand the underlying issue, you’ll waste developer time and derail your whole sprint&nbsp;schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of the&nbsp;trade</strong></p>

<p>The first thing I like to do is identify the frequency of the problem, severity, and systems involved. This helps me prioritize my workload and figure out where to start&nbsp;looking.</p>

<p>Like any good investigator you’ll need to collect and analyze the evidence. Clear, concise documentation will help newcomers onboard to the problem quickly, and prevent you from having to explain everything from&nbsp;scratch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain test credentials and dummy email accounts for various user states and&nbsp;configurations.</li>
  <li>Replicate bugs using test accounts and isolated Chrome profiles or Firefox&nbsp;Containers.</li>
  <li>Record videos or markup screenshots to illustrate expected vs. actual behavior. Android and i<span>OS</span> offer these features natively, and Mac<span>OS</span> has a really nice extended screenshot + recording menu that you can markup with the Preview&nbsp;app.</li>
  <li>Meticulously document expected behavior (requirements), actual behavior (the bug), and other minor details like platform, mobile app version, exact <span>UX</span> flow,&nbsp;etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a technical background, you can go a step further by digging into the logs, code, and&nbsp;data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Validate <span>API</span> calls and responses using c<span>URL</span> or Postman. A very smart engineer once told me, <em>“if you’re having the same problem on two different platforms, it’s probably a backend&nbsp;issue.”</em></li>
  <li>Navigate <span>JSON</span> <span>&amp;</span> XMLs objects – most APIs will return data in one of these formats. A decent text editor will come in&nbsp;handy.</li>
  <li>Write <span>SQL</span> queries, export data, and analyze it. Brush up on your selects, joins, and group by clauses – the data you want is rarely in the format you&nbsp;want.</li>
  <li>Query and filter application logs to identify customer-specific actions, errors, and&nbsp;patterns.</li>
  <li>Debug web apps using your browser’s Developer Tools (network traffic, JavaScript console) or <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">CharlesProxy</a> for mobile&nbsp;apps.</li>
  <li>Look for references to specific error strings and codes in your code or environment&nbsp;configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hitting the&nbsp;Bricks</strong></p>

<p>Product Management isn’t a job you can do with your head down and earphones cranked up. You have to get out there and talk to&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>Detectives build relationships with <em>informants</em>, who can guide them in areas where they lack experience or exposure. I urge you to do the same, especially within big organizations. The clue that blows the case wide open may come from another <span>PM</span>, an Engineer across the globe, your Operations team, vendors, or quite frequently, a&nbsp;customer.</p>

<p>True story: I spent half of last week trying to validate a new feature which relied on some APIs maintained by different teams. Despite hours of searching for and reading documentation, I made zero progress on my own. Finally, I called another <span>PM</span> for&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>I spent <em>five minutes</em> explaining my situation, before she sprung into action. She set up a Slack channel, tagged representatives from each team, and said <em>“Neal needs a hand with X, Y, and Z.”</em> Two days later, my features were live in&nbsp;prod!</p>

<p><strong>Stay&nbsp;curious</strong></p>

<p>In the real world, detective work is fairly mundane: interviewing witnesses, pulling financial records, requesting warrants. High profile heists and car chases are pretty rare. But at every step, detectives ask why. They look for inconsistencies, and question&nbsp;motives.</p>

<p>The same goes for Product Management. Day in and day out, you’re doing discovery, setting priorities, grooming tickets, and putting out small fires. But, no matter how ordinary a task seems, you should take a deeper&nbsp;look.</p>

<p>When you investigate, ask open ended questions to uncover the problem the customer is facing, what they were trying to do, and what actions led them there. Try using the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Five_whys">Five Whys</a> method and remember, your job isn’t to fix problems in real time, it’s to <em>detect</em> what’s going&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>This applies to product requests too. When Marketing says <em>“can you please build us this very specific feature that does X?”</em> Your first instinct shouldn’t be to give them a yes or no&nbsp;answer.</p>

<p>In my experience, people are better at articulating symptoms and solutions, than they are at <em>causes and needs</em>. But if you get someone to open up and explain what they’re really after, then you can identify what to&nbsp;build.</p>

<p><strong>Call for&nbsp;backup</strong></p>

<p>Whenever my investigation hits a wall, I recruit a partner. With a fresh set of eyes, we can apply a different perspective, bounce ideas off each other, and hopefully make a&nbsp;breakthrough.</p>

<p>I’m a damn good partner too, because I’ll do whatever I can to make my partner’s life easier. That includes scheduling meetings, writing tickets, documenting everything in Confluence, or taking the heat when we’re behind. It’s my approach to building trust: ask for their best, and never give ‘em your&nbsp;worst.</p>

<p>Of course, everyone has their own priorities, so you may have to flex in order to motivate them. Whether that’s calling in a favor or highlighting the customer impact, (frequency! severity! <span>NPS</span>!), it’s part of their job, so don’t feel too bad. But do remember to pay the favor back, or ideally,&nbsp;forward.</p>

<p><strong>Hard, but not <em>hard-boiled</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s frustrating to work products where you’re pulled in different directions every day because of a new bug or some priority request. It’s even worse when you’re under pressure to get it all done&nbsp;yesterday.</p>

<p>In the movies, detectives are often sour mavericks with little regard for their own health and other people’s feelings. But that won’t fly in real life. No matter how frazzled you are, there’s no excuse to be a jerk. If you’re feeling burnt out, take a break and get&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>A story has been making the rounds today about a criminal in Germany that held over $60 million in Bitcoin before being arrested. Incredibly, the media still doesn’t understand what it means to “own” Bitcoin, claiming that the government “confiscated” the funds but “can’t unlock” them…</p>



<p>It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin’s underlying technology. Unlike other currencies (like cash or gold), one does not own Bitcoin simply by holding something in their material possession (in this case, a computer or a wallet). Instead, one owns Bitcoin when one has access to the Bitcoin by way of a private key.</p>



<p>So no, German prosecutors have in fact <em>not</em> “confiscated more than $60 million worth of Bitcoin.” Instead, they’ve confiscated a worthless piece of hardware.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The misunderstanding stems from the fact that Bitcoin is “stored” on a the public blockchain (a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions), <em>not</em> on a personal hard drive or cryptocurrency wallet. Those devices were used to access the Bitcoin by the fraudster in this case, but the “password” that the media speaks of —&nbsp;which the prosecutors can’t access —&nbsp;is really <em>the Bitcoin itself</em>. It’s the private key associated with this criminal’s coins.</p>



<p>In this case, the criminal’s Bitcoin are <em>literally </em>stored in the criminal’s mind, and they refuse to give them up. As long as this fraudster is still alive and has functioning memory, their bitcoin will remain securely in their possession. </p>



<p>Obviously this has ramifications for a governments’ ability to properly punish criminal activity, but it’s also a radical new idea in money that provides security and true ownership to legal citizens. Just like this criminal can retain ownership of his Bitcoin despite being jailed for life, a person living under an oppressive regime can retain ownership of their Bitcoin in their mind no matter how much their government wishes to unfairly confiscate it.</p>



<p>It’s critical to understand the ramifications of this, and for that reason, it’s critical that the media understands what it means to own Bitcoin. Never in human history has money been truly trustless digital information, which clearly benefits criminals that would prefer not to part with their stash, but it also benefits law-abiding citizens who wish to truly own their wealth. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-3c75a6d7=""><h2 id="1---reducing-customer-churn-is-the-best-way-to-boost-growth" data-v-3c75a6d7="">1 &nbsp; Reducing customer churn is the best way to boost growth</h2>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">The very unfortunate truth about customer churn is that it scales with your business. <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Meaning, the more your business grows, the more customers you'll have cancelling every month</strong>. In order to keep pace with your expanding churn numbers, you'll either need to find magical exponential growth, reduce your churn, or risk hitting an early growth ceiling.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Let's say, for example, our software-as-a-service (SaaS) product has an average monthly revenue of $50/customer. When we first start up, we're adding 100 customers a month, growing our MRR by $5,000 each month. In the second month, 7 of those customers cancel their subscriptions (a 7% churn rate - the industry average for B2C SaaS companies). Not a big deal - we're still netting 93 new customers! In the following month, another 7% churn - 13 of our 193 customers entering the month. But, we've added another 100 new customers, still netting 87 new subscriptions and a healthy $4,350 uptick in MRR. </p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">So we continue on our merry way adding to our top line revenue each month. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, churn rears its ugly head. Midway through our second year, we've reached 1400 customers, and guess what? Thanks to our 7% churn rate, we're only breaking even with the 100 new customers that sign up each month. Our customer base (and revenue) is no longer growing. We have officially hit our growth ceiling - 1,400 customers and $71,000 MRR.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Unfortunately, this is far from a hypothetical example for me. Churn became a very real problem very quickly for Wavve.co. <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Luckily for all of us, a small reduction in churn can yield a massive boost in the growth ceiling</strong>. To continue with the numbers above, let's cut the churn rate from 7% to 5%. With this reduction, the growth ceiling suddenly jumps up from $71,000 MRR to $100,000 MRR - an increase of more than 40% and $350K ARR. </p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Below, you can play around with how a 30% reduction in churn rate can impact future growth.</p>
<div data-v-3c75a6d7=""><div> <div><div><p>
          $301,500
        </p> <p>
          more revenue over 24 months
           with a 30% churn reduction.
        </p> <div>  <div> <p>
              MRR growth in 24 months with
               a 30% churn reduction:
              $25,950
            </p></div> <div> <p>
              MRR growth in 24 months  at previous pace:
              $5,302
            </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">I would argue that reducing customer churn is the single best thing that most SaaS companies can be doing right now. As fun as growth is, keeping the customers you do have is far cheaper than acquiring new ones. With this in mind, let's take an in depth look at what can be done to reduce churn. First, we're going to be diving into churn prediction, where companies try to figure out which customers are going to cancel their subscriptions, and try to do something about it before that happens. This is often one of the first steps that a company will take once they realize their churn rate is becoming the limiting factor with their future growth.</p>
<h2 id="2---how-churn-prediction-works-in-practice" data-v-3c75a6d7="">2 &nbsp; How churn prediction works in practice</h2>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">At its core, churn prediction attempts to put customers into two buckets:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Customers who will churn</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Customers who will not churn.</li>
</ol>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Simple enough, right?</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">As far as the data science is concerend, churn prediction can be treated as a standard classification problem. We can look at a user’s behavior – how long they’ve been a customer, when they were last active, how much they’ve been paying per month, whether they’ve used your new feature, etc. – and train a machine learning model to predict how likely that user is to cancel their subscription in the next month.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">There are a variety of machine learning models that can predict churn reasonably well. In practice, decision trees and logistic regression tend to be commonly used. I full-heartedly predict that we will see a shift towards recurrent neural net (RNN) models in the near future, as they provide a much more natural model for this problem - and I’ll be writing on that soon, but for now, let’s put aside which ML model is used, and turn our focus to how they are used.</p>
<h3 id="21-what-is-done-with-churn-predictions" data-v-3c75a6d7="">2.1 What is done with churn predictions</h3>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Once we’ve trained a model to predict how likely a customer is to churn in the next month - how can we use that information to improve our bottom line? In particular, how can we use it to prevent cancellations? Below, I've plotted a hypothetical distribution of our customers and their likelihood to churn in the next month following what a typical distribution may look like for a SaaS company. You'll note that I've also marked a cutoff at 80%, highlighting the customers that our model predicted had at least an 80% probability to churn in the coming month.</p>
<p><img alt="Likelihood of churn histogram" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ed7ff531a516bff2e6e614dc56d153f3ca017503/09dd7/img/likelihood-of-churning-wide-alt.png" data-v-3c75a6d7=""></p><p data-v-3c75a6d7="">In developing our churn prediction model, the general idea is that <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">we pick out the customers that are deemed “likely to churn” and hit them with a retention campaign</strong>, hoping to reinvigorate their love of the product, and, with a bit of luck on our side, prevent them from cancelling their subscription.</p>
<h3 id="22-the-retention-campaign" data-v-3c75a6d7="">2.2 The retention campaign</h3>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">A good retention campaign is product specific, but in general they tend to follow a lot of the same patterns. The objectives here are to (i) re-engage customers so they get more value out of your product and/or (ii) present a customer offer to get them to stick around. Common retention tactics can include:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">An email newsletter to bring your product to the front of customer’s minds<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">A new product feature announcement</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Showcase how other customers are using your product</li>
</ol></li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Initiating “customer success” calls, or sending direct emails to customers you want to re-engage</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Reminding users to use the credits left in their account (ex. Audible)</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Offer a one-time discount for users (ex. Uber)</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Offer to put a customer’s subscription on pause (ex. Audible)</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7="">Offer to switch (downgrade) a customer’s plan</li>
</ol>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Depending on your product, these campaigns should see varying (but typically pretty strong) engagement rates. At Wavve.co, we’ve had nearly 35% of customers accept an offer to temporarily pause their account.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">So, we’re getting after the right customers using our churn prediction model, and the retention campaigns are sufficiently engaging – all is well, right?</p>
<h2 id="3---where-churn-prediction-goes-wrong" data-v-3c75a6d7="">3 &nbsp; Where churn prediction goes wrong</h2>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Let’s briefly back up and refocus on what our end goal is. We set out to reduce churn. In an attempt to do this, we designed a machine learning model which sifted through customer data and found the customers who were most likely to cancel their accounts. We then targeted these high risk customers with retention campaigns, hoping to prevent them from churning.</p>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Unfortunately, it isn’t so simple. In this section, I’ll dig into what can go wrong with this pattern of churn prediction and customer re-engagement, including disturbing the “do-not-disturb” customers, sending discounts to people who wouldn’t have churned anyway, and the self-biasing nature of churn prediction once we start using its predictions to decide who to target with retention campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="31-churn-prevention-≠-churn-minimization" data-v-3c75a6d7="">3.1 Churn prevention ≠ churn minimization</h3>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">When we marked a customer to be targeted with a retention campaign, we took action. We reached out to these people ― to ask if they wanted to check out our new feature, or if they wanted more credits or a discount, etc. And some of these customers, who would have otherwise cancelled their subscription, decided to stick around. Great! But, at the same time, <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">by knocking on these user's doors, we’ve also prompted some customers, who would not have otherwise churned, to cancel their subscriptions</strong>. Just a few weeks ago, Audible sent me a reminder that I had 2 credits to use. As luck would have it, that was just the reminder I needed to cancel my subscription! Clearly, this is exactly the opposite result Audible had hoped for with their churn prevention campaign.</p>
<h4 id="311-four-customers" data-v-3c75a6d7="">3.1.1 Four customers</h4>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">To make things concrete, let’s categorize our customers into four groups based on their churn behavior with and without us taking action on them by using a retention campaign. We’ll get into the details of using different retention campaigns later, but for now let’s look at simply either "targeted" and "not targeted" to represent customers who were treated with a retention campaign or not, respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="The 4 customer types" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e46516789adfbf402a4c2301140ea190e38032ae/13971/img/4-customers.png" data-v-3c75a6d7=""></p><p data-v-3c75a6d7="">Breaking these down:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Do-not-disturbs.</strong> Customers who won’t churn <em data-v-3c75a6d7="">unless</em> we use a retention campaign. This is me cancelling my Audible subscription when they told me I had credits to use. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have thought about it and would have stayed a subscriber.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Sure things.</strong> These are your adamant subscribers – the customers who will be with you next month whether or not we use a retention campaign on them. Love this group.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Lost causes.</strong> This is just the opposite. The customers in this group are going to cancel their subscription no matter what we do.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Persuadables.</strong> This is the group we want to go after with retention campaigns. These customers are going to churn if we don’t do anything but will stick around if we use a retention campaign on them.</li>
</ol>
<p data-v-3c75a6d7="">In an ideal world, our churn prevention techniques would strictly target the fourth group, the persuadables. In reality, our predictive models are far from perfect and, regrettably, <strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">we are actually losing profits every time we target a customer who belongs to any of the other three groups</strong>:</p>
<ol data-v-3c75a6d7="">
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Do not disturbs.</strong> Worst case scenario – by intervening, we lose customers who would otherwise would have continued as subscribers.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Sure things.</strong> When we allocate retention campaigns to this group, we are lowering profits by giving credits, discounts, and other costly perks to customers who would have kept paying us at full cost.</li>
<li data-v-3c75a6d7=""><strong data-v-3c75a6d7="">Lost causes.</strong> For these customers, we are losing the cost of running the retention campaign. This can vary largely between companies. If we’re just sending an email, then not much lost. If we’re a B2B SaaS company doing manual outreach and customer calls, this can get quite costly.</li>

But those reasons may change. Whether motivated by the need for a multi-cloud strategy, expenditure minimization, legislative or regulatory demands, or simply to get closer to end users, many organizations find themselves migrating from one cloud to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration for a non-trivial application contains a lot of unknown unknowns. This causes stress and uncertainty for a CTO. To help shed some light based on years of experience in the field, we have asked senior cloud architect Lars Larsson at Elastisys, to list some of these issues.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="f9b26b8" data-element_type="section"></section><section data-id="8342740" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="8117dc4" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="927e5d2" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="icon-list.default"><div><ul><li> <span> 		</span> <span>Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, each with their own associated costs.

If so, please take a long and hard look at the various costs in each of the clouds. Because each service has a different cost model, making it very difficult to compare accurately. You really need to get to the bottom of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Compute and storage costs are often easy enough to compare, because those are the most obvious two. But what about other services? How much are you spending on, e.g., log handling or monitoring? Good services such as AWS CloudWatch come at a cost, especially if you use it for log handling too (AWS CloudWatch Logs). Are you heavily using a managed database service? A queueing or pub/sub service?</p><p dir="ltr">Avoid feeling like that one time the surprise cloud bill hit you in the face by doing your homework this time. You are wiser from the experience, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">Network transfers in and out of the cloud can also vary by quite a large amount. The three major providers will give you incoming network traffic for free, but charge you for the outgoing traffic. Smaller, regional, cloud providers will often have higher compute and storage costs, but not charge you for network traffic. Or include a much larger amount of it in a free tier offering.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>Overwhelming? I get it. It sure looks that way at first glance! But it doesn’t have to be.

Reduce vendor lock-in? Are you now surprised at finding out that you are still locked in, but on a different level?</p><p dir="ltr">What I’ve seen is that most organizations will make sure they have highly portable application definitions. By relying on Kubernetes, the application definitions work across cloud providers.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">But what I’ve also seen is that if you are using a managed Kubernetes service, your users and permissions handling is perhaps tied not to Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) features, but rather, to cloud-specific offerings. Like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Great service, but ties you to the AWS platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Fully-managed Kubernetes services, if offered by cloud vendors themselves, serve to offer a highly integrated experience. The cost of that integration is that migration to another cloud provider becomes just that certain amount more difficult.</p><p dir="ltr">As a community, we’ve tried to fix this. But as a community of engineers, those fixes are technical. Kubernetes dictates standards for certain components or aspects. Networking has to work according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standard. Storage according to Container Storage Interface (CSI). And so on. Great. But the business people have put in much more clever ways of locking you to the platform. This means that other less obvious aspects are more difficult to freely migrate from one cloud to another.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>So what is the option? Do you have to manage Kubernetes yourself? No. Of course not. But it may make sense to investigate managed Kubernetes offerings that are not tied to a particular cloud provider to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. Without having to take on the task of day-to-day operations on your own, of course.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="d0e3450" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="ba42612" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="6dc9c60" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="icon-list.default"><div><ul><li> <span> 		</span> <span>Key takeaway: Investigate the ways in which cloud providers make migration more difficult due to incompatible integrations.

They went to the cloud because they wanted to get infrastructure or platform functionality on an as-a-Service basis. That is the whole point of the cloud, is it not?</span></p><p><span>So, of course, all cloud providers will offer certain services. It used to be just infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, network, and storage) but we are starting to also take, e.g., object storage and queuing services for granted. Many such services will claim to offer an “S3 compatible API” or similar. And that is a great starting point! But beware, because what does such a compatibility claim really mean?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>AWS S3, for example, was, until December 2020, merely eventually consistent. Since </span><a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/aws-s3-strong-consistency/"><span>their announcement</span></a><span>, it is read-after-write consistent (strong consistency). Which level of consistency would a service that is “S3 compatible” have? The old one? Or the new one? And do you have aspects of your applications that depend on that answer being one or the other? Would you know off-hand?</span></p><p><span>If you don’t, by the way, you’re in excellent company. Most people’s eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed. But then again, you don’t want to get bitten by a bug caused by wrongful assumptions, so somebody has to stay awake to figure this stuff out. Hopefully not past midnight!</span></p><p><span>Ready for another unexciting example? Queuing services, such as AWS SQS, offer certain delivery guarantees. SQS standard queues offer “at least once” guarantees. That means that a message can be delivered to your application more than once, and must have logic in place for dealing with duplicates. An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service. (Note that while SQS offers FIFO queues that have “exactly once” </span><b>processing</b><span> guarantees, however, that </span><a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/sqs-fifo-queues-message-ordering-and-exactly-once-processing-guaranteed"><span>does not imply exactly once delivery</span></a><span>.)

	<div>

      <p>
	Part of the origin myth of modern computing is the story of a
	golden age in the 1960s and 1970s. In this story, visionary
	pioneers pursued a dream in which computers enabled powerful
	tools for thought, that is, tools to augment human
	intelligence<span> E.g., Douglas
	Engelbart, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
	Intellect: A Conceptual Framework</a> (1962).</span>. One of
	those pioneers, Alan Kay, summed up the optimism of this dream
	when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer:
	“the very use of it would actually change the thought
	patterns of an entire
	civilization”<span> Alan
	Kay, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf">User Interface: A Personal
	View</a> (1989).</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	It's an inspiring dream, which helped lead to modern
	interactive graphics, windowing interfaces, word processors,
	and much else. But retrospectively it's difficult not to be
	disappointed, to feel that computers have not yet been nearly
	as transformative as far older tools for thought, such as
	language and writing. Today, it's common in technology circles
	to pay lip service to the pioneering dreams of the past. But
	nostalgia aside there is little determined effort to pursue
	the vision of transformative new tools for thought.
      </p>

      <p>
	We believe now is a good time to work hard on this vision
	again. In this essay we sketch out a set of ideas we believe
	can be used to help develop transformative new tools for
	thought. In the first part of the essay we describe an
	experimental prototype system that we've built, a kind
	of <em>mnemonic medium</em> intended to augment human memory.
	This is a snapshot of an ongoing project, detailing both
	encouraging progress as well as many challenges and
	opportunities.  In the second part of the essay, we broaden
	the focus. We sketch several other prototype systems. And we
	address the question: why is it that the technology industry
	has made comparatively little effort developing this vision of
	transformative tools for thought?
      </p>

      <p>
	In the opening we mentioned some visionaries of the past. To
	those could be added many others – Ivan Sutherland,
	Seymour Papert, Vannevar Bush, and more. Online there is much
	well-deserved veneration for these people. But such veneration
	can veer into an unhealthy reverence for the good old days, a
	belief that giants once roamed the earth, and today's work is
	lesser. Yes, those pioneers did amazing things, and arguably
	had ways of working that modern technologists, in both
	industry and academia, are poorly equipped to carry on. But
	they also made mistakes, and were ignorant of powerful ideas
	that are available today. And so a theme through both parts of
	the essay is to identify powerful ideas that weren't formerly
	known or weren't acted upon. Out of this understanding arises
	a conviction that a remarkable set of opportunities is open
	today.
      </p>

      <p>
	A word on nomenclature: the term “tools for
	thought” rolls off neither the tongue nor the
	keyboard. What's more, the term “tool” implies a
	certain narrowness. Alan Kay has
	argued<span> Again, in Alan
	Kay, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf">User Interface: A Personal
	View</a> (1989), among other places.</span> that a more
	powerful aim is to develop a new <em>medium for
	thought</em>. A medium such as, say,
	Adobe <em>Illustrator</em> is essentially different from any
	of the individual tools <em>Illustrator</em> contains. Such a
	medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in
	which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that
	were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range
	of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an
	emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in
	that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the
	possible range of human thought.
      </p>

      <p>
	With that said, the term “tools for thought” has
	been widely used since Iverson's 1950s and 1960s
	work<span> An account may be found in
	Iverson's Turing Award
	lecture, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Iverson1979.pdf">Notation as a Tool
	of Thought</a> (1979). Incidentally, even Iverson is really
	describing a medium for thought, the APL programming language,
	not a narrow tool.</span> introducing the term. And so we
	shall use “tools for thought” as our catch all
	phrase, while giving ourselves license to explore a broader
	range, and also occasionally preferring the term
	“medium” when it is apt.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's come back to that phrase from the opening, about
	changing “the thought patterns of an entire
	civilization”. It sounds ludicrous, a kind of tech
	soothsaying. Except, of course, such changes have happened
	multiple times during human history: the development of
	language, of writing, and our other most powerful tools for
	thought. And, for better and worse, computers really have
	affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the
	past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the
	beginning. This essay is a small contribution to understanding
	how such changes happen, and what is still possible.
      </p>

      <p>
	The musician and comedian Martin Mull has observed that
	“writing about music is like dancing about
	architecture”. In a similar way, there's an inherent
	inadequacy in writing about tools for thought. To the extent
	that such a tool succeeds, it expands your thinking beyond
	what can be achieved using existing tools, including
	writing. The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap
	that is opened.  Conversely, the larger the gap, the more
	difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what
	writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as
	a bootstrap. It's a way of identifying points of leverage that
	may help develop new tools for thought. So let's get on with
	it.
      </p>


      

      <h2 id="introducing-mnemonic-medium">Introducing the mnemonic medium</h2>
      
      <p>
	Few subjects are more widely regarded as difficult than
	quantum computing and quantum mechanics. Indeed, popular media
	accounts often regale (and intimidate) readers with quotes
	from famous physicists in the vein of: “anyone who
	thinks they’ve understood quantum mechanics has not understood
	quantum mechanics”.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	What makes these subjects difficult? In fact, individually
	many of the underlying ideas are not too complicated for
	people with a technical background. But the ideas come in an
	overwhelming number, a tsunami of unfamiliar concepts and
	notation. People must learn in rapid succession of qubits, the
	bra-ket notation, Hadamard gates, controlled-not gates, and
	many, many other abstract, unfamiliar notions. They're
	imbibing an entire new language. Even if they can follow at
	first, understanding later ideas requires fluency with all the
	earlier ideas. It's overwhelming and eventually disheartening.
      </p>

      <p>
	As an experiment, we have developed a
	website, <a href="https://quantum.country/"><em>Quantum
	Country</em></a>, which explores a new approach to explaining
	quantum computing and quantum
	mechanics. Ostensibly, <em>Quantum Country</em> appears to be
	a conventional essay introduction to these subjects. There is
	text, explanations, and equations, much as in any other
	technical essay. Here's an excerpt:
      </p>
			
      <p><img src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample-2x.png" srcset="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample.png, https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample-2x.png 2x" alt="Screenshot depicting prose and math in Quantum Country, typical of a technical essay."></p><p>
	But it's not a conventional essay. Rather, <em>Quantum
	Country</em> is a prototype for a new type of <em>mnemonic
	medium</em>. Aspirationally, the mnemonic medium makes it
	almost effortless for users to remember what they read. That
	may sound like an impossible aspiration. What makes it
	plausible is that cognitive scientists know a considerable
	amount about how human beings store long-term
	memories. Indeed, what they know can almost be distilled to an
	actionable recipe: follow these steps, and you can remember
	whatever you choose.
      </p>

      <p>
	Unfortunately, those steps are poorly supported by existing
	media.<span>For more on this argument, see
	Andy Matuschak, <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Why
	books don’t work</a> (2019).</span> Is it possible to
	design a new medium which much more actively supports
	memorization? That is, the medium would build in (and, ideally,
	make almost effortless) the key steps involved in memory. If we
	could do this, then instead of memory being a haphazard event,
	subject to chance, the mnemonic medium would make memory into a
	choice. Of course, on its own this wouldn't make it trivial to
	learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing
	– learning those subjects is about much more than memory.
	But it would help in addressing one core difficulty: the
	overwhelming number of new concepts and notation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	In fact, there are many ways of redesigning the essay medium
	to do that. Before showing you our prototype, please pause for
	a moment and consider the following questions: how could you
	build a medium to better support a person's memory of what
	they read?  What interactions could easily and enjoyably help
	people consolidate memories? And, more broadly: is it possible
	to 2x what people remember? 10x? And would that make any
	long-term difference to their effectiveness?
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's sketch the user experience of <em>Quantum
	Country</em>. At the time of this writing the site contains
	three mnemonic essays (i.e., particular instances of the
	mnemonic medium). We'll focus on the introductory essay,
	<a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">“Quantum
	  Computing for the Very Curious”</a>. Embedded within
	  the text of the essay are 112 questions about that
	  text. Users are asked to create an account, and quizzed as
	  they read on whether they remember the answers to those
	  questions. Here's what the interaction looks like, as a user
	  answers three questions.
      </p>

			<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
				<source src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.mp4" type="video/mp4">

				<source src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.ogv" type="video/ogg">
			</video>

      <p>
	Note that this interaction occurs within the text of the essay
	itself. Here's a zoomed-out view, so you can see how such
	questions are surrounded by essay text both above and below:
      </p>

	<p><img src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out-2x.png" srcset="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out.png, https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out-2x.png 2x" alt="Screenshot depicting the interactive quiz interleaved in a few paragraphs of prose."></p><p>
	We use the term <em>cards</em> for these interface elements
	pairing questions and answers.
      </p>

      <p>
	Of course, for long-term memory it's not enough for users to
	be tested just once on their recall. Instead, a few days after
	first reading the essay, the user receives an email asking
	them to sign into a review session. In that review session
	they're …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>A few years ago, when the IETF’s Crypto Forum Research Group was deeply entrenched in debates about elliptic curves for security (which eventually culminated in RFC 7748 and RFC 8032), an IT Consultant <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/VXLC6cj2KwecsWRhp0yJXLF9jEw/">showed up on the mailing list</a> with their homemade cipher, Crystalline.</p>



<p>Mike Hamburg <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">politely</a> informed the consultant that the CFRG isn’t the right forum for proposing new symmetric ciphers, or even new modes for symmetric ciphers, and invited them to email them off-list.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the CFRG, let me just say, this was on the more patient and measured responses I’ve ever read.</p>



<p>Naturally, the author of Crystalline responded with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m somewhat disappointed in your reply, as I presumed that someone with a stated interest in ciphers would be eager to investigate anything new to pop up that didn’t have obvious holes in it. It almost sounds like you have had your soul crushed by bureaucracy over the years and have lost all passion for this field.</p><cite>Full quote available <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">here</a>. It doesn’t get much better.</cite></blockquote>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The discussion continued until Tony Arcieri dropped <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">one of the most brutal takedowns</a> of a cryptographic design in CFRG history.</p>



<blockquote><p>I think the biggest problem though is all of this has already been pointed out to you repeatedly in other forums and you completely refuse to acknowledge that your cipher fails to meet the absolute most minimum criteria for a secure cipher.</p><cite>Tony Arcieri, landing a cryptographic 360 no-scope on Crystalline.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this mic drop moment, the author of Crystalline continued to double down and insist that a symmetric cipher doesn’t need to be indistinguishable from randomness to be secure (which, to severely understate the affairs, is simply not true).</p>



<p>Normally, when a cipher fails at the indistinguishable test, it’s subtle. This is what Crystalline ciphertexts look like.</p>

<p>Modern ciphers produce something that will look like white noise, like an old TV without the cable plugged in. There should be no discernible pattern.</p>



<p>Crystalline’s author remained convinced that Crystalline’s “131072-bit keys” and claims of “information-theoretic security” were compelling enough to warrant consideration by the standards body that keeps the Internet running.</p>



<p>This was in 2015. In the year 2021, I can safely say that Crystalline adoption never really took off.</p>



<h2>Against Crackpot Crypto</h2>



<p>Instances of Crackpot Cryptography don’t always look like Crystalline. Sometimes the authors are more charismatic, or have more financial resources to bedazzle would-be <s>suckers</s>^<sup>investors</sup>. Other times, they’re less brazen and keep their designs far away from the watchful gaze of expert opinions–lest their mistakes be exposed for all to see.</p>



<p>Crackpot cryptography is considered dangerous–not because we want people to avoid encryption entirely, but because crackpot cryptography offers a false sense of security. This leads to users acting in ways they wouldn’t if they knew there was little-to-no security. Due to the strictly performative nature of these security measures, I also like to call them <strong>Security Theater</strong> (although that term is more broadly applicable in other contexts).</p>



<p>The Cryptology community has a few defense mechanisms in place to prevent the real-world adoption of crackpot cryptography. More specifically, we have pithy mottos that distill best practices in a way that usually gets the intent across. (Hey, it’s something!) Unfortunately, the rest of the security industry outside of cryptology often weaponizes these mottos to promote useless and harmful gatekeeping.</p>



<p>The best example of this is the, “Don’t roll your own crypto!” motto.</p>



<h3 id="roll-your-own">They See Me Rollin’ [My Own Crypto]</h3>



<p>Crackpots never adhere to this rule, so anyone who violates it immediately or often, with wild abandon, can be safely dismissed for kooky behavior.</p>



<p>But if taken to its literal, logical extreme, this rule mandates that nobody would ever write cryptographic code and we wouldn’t <em>have</em> cryptography libraries to begin with. So, clearly, it’s a rule meant to be sometimes broken.</p>



<p>This is why some cryptography engineers <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">soften the message a bit</a> and encourage tinkering for the sake of education. The world needs more software engineers qualified to write cryptography.</p>



<p>After all, you wouldn’t expect to hear “Don’t roll your own crypto” being levied against Jason Donenfeld (WireGuard) or Frank Denis (libsodium), despite the fact that both of those people did just that.</p>



<p>But what about <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">a high-level library that defers to libsodium for its actual crypto implementations</a>?</p>







<p>In a twist that surprises no one, lazy heuristics have a high false positive rate. In this case, the lazy heuristic is both, “What qualifies as rolling one’s own crypto?” as well as, “When is it safe to break this rule?”</p>



<p>More broadly, though, is that these knee-jerk responses are a misfiring defense mechanism intended to stop quacks from taking all the air out of the room.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always work, though. There have been a few downright absurd instances of crackpot cryptography in the past few years.</p>



<h2>Modern Examples of Crypto Crackpottery</h2>



<h3 id="craig-wright">Craig Wright’s Sartre Signature Scam</h3>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the anonymous cryptographer that invented Bitcoin. In the years since Satoshi has gone quiet, a few cranks have come out of the woodwork to claim to be the real Satoshi.</p>



<p>Craig Wright is one of the more famous Satoshi impersonators due to his <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/">Sartre Signature Scam</a>.</p>



<p>Satoshi’s earliest Bitcoin transactions are public. If you can lift the public key and signature from the transaction and then replay them in a different context as “proof” that you’re Satoshi, you can produce a proof of identity that validates without having to possess Satoshi’s private key. Then you can just wildly claim it’s a signature that validates the text of some philosopher’s prose and a lot of people will believe you.</p>



<p>With a little bit of showmanship added on, you too can convince Gavin Anderson by employing this tactic. (Or maybe not; I imagine he’s learned his lesson by now.)</p>



<h3 id="time-ai">Time AI</h3>



<p>Crown Sterling’s sponsored talk at Black Hat USA 2019 is the most vivid example of crackpot cryptography in most people’s minds.</p>



<p>Even the name “Time AI” just screams buzzword soup, so it should come as no surprise that their talk covered a lot of nonsense: “quasi-prime numbers”, “infinite wave conjugations”, “nano-scale of time”, “speed of AI oscillations”, “unified physics cosmology”, and “multi-dimensional encryption technology”.</p>



<p>Naturally, this pissed a lot of cryptographers off, and the normally even-keeled Dan Guido of Trail of Bits actually called them out on their bullshit during their presentation’s Q&amp;A section.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I yelled at the Time AI guy. It’s ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people. I was shocked that more people haven’t done the same. <a href="https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk">https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk</a></p>— Dan Guido (@dguido) <a href="https://twitter.com/dguido/status/1159579063540805632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For most people, the story ended with a bunch of facepalms. But Crown Sterling doubled down and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/crown_sterling_.html">published a press release claiming the ability to break 256-bit RSA keys</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="116" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatok_stickerpack-facepaw/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/soatok_stickerpack-facepaw.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Facepaw!" data-image-description="<p>Facepaw!</p>

<p>Amusingly, their attack took 50 seconds–which is a lot slower than the standard RSA factoring attacks for small key sizes.</p>



<p>(For those who are missing context: In order to be secure, RSA requires public key sizes in excess of 2048 bits. Breaking 256-bit RSA should take less than a minute on any modern PC.)</p>



<h3 id="terra-quantum">Terra Quantum</h3>



<p>Earlier this week, Bloomberg news ran a story titled, <em><a href="https://archive.md/sZ1Q5">A Swiss Company Says It Found Weakness That Imperils Encryption</a></em>. If you only read the first few paragraphs, it’s really clear that the story basically boils down to, “Swiss Company realizes there’s an entire discipline of computer science dedicated to quantum computers and the risks they pose to cryptography.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick primer on quantum computers and cryptography:</p>



<p>If a practical quantum computer is ever built, it can immediately break all of the <em>asymmetric</em> cryptography used on the Internet today: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, etc. The attack costs to break these algorithms vary, but are generally in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> range (for numbers of queries).</p>



<p>The jury is still out on whether or not quantum computers will ever be practical. Just in case, a lot of cryptographers are working on <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> (algorithms that are secure even against quantum computers).</p>



<p>Symmetric cryptography fares a lot better: The attack costs are roughly reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+N&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt N" title="\sqrt N">. This makes a 128-bit secure cipher have only a 64-bit security level, which is pretty terrible, but a 256-bit secure cipher remains at the 128-bit security level even with practical quantum computers.</p>



<p>So it’s a little strange that they open with:</p>



<blockquote><p>The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.</p><cite>From the Bloomberg article.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Uh, no.</p>



<p>Let’s do some math: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> calculations can be performed in <em>seconds</em> on modern computers. If we assume that practical quantum computers are also as fast as classical computers, it’s safe to assume this will hold true as well.</p>



<p>You can break 128-bit ciphers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time, using <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63068/attacking-aes-128-with-grovers-algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a>. You can’t break 256-bit ciphers <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">in any practical time</a>, even with the quantum computer speed-up. Most software prefers 256-bit AES over 128-bit AES for this reason.</p>



<p>What does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time look like?</p>

      <p>If you didn't see it, please check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1">part 1 of this series</a> to understand the purpose of this. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<h2 id="partial-functions-in-general">Partial functions (in general)</h2>
<p>Laziness very likely belongs in this list. My favorite part of criticizing laziness is how quickly people jump to defend it based on edge cases. So let's be a bit more nuanced before I later get far <em>less</em> nuanced. Laziness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. Strictness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. They also both suck. It depends on context and purpose. Each of them introduce different kinds of issues. The real question is: what's a more sensible default? We'll get to that another time.</p>
<p>I called this section partial functions. Am I having a senior moment? Maybe, but I intentionally started with laziness. In a strict language, function calls can result in exceptions being thrown, segfaulting occurring, or panicking. (And if I write a "Rust: The Bad Parts", believe me, I'll be mentioning panicking.) The fact that a function <em>acts</em> like it can successfully perform something, but in fact fails in a predictable way (like failing a <code>HashMap</code> lookup), it should be reflected at the type level. If not, ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a language that doesn't let you reflect this information at the type level: ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Partial functions are the antithesis of this concept. They allow you to say "yeah dude, I can <em>totally</em> give you the first value in an empty list." Partial functions are like politicians: you can tell they're lying because their lips are moving. ("But Michael," you say. "Functions don't have lips!" Whatever, I'm waxing poetical.)</p>
<p>Alright, so plenty of languages screw this up. Haskell tells those languages "hold my beer."</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snoyman.com/static/images/holdmybeer.jpg"></p><p>Haskell screws up partial functions way, way worse than other languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It promotes a whole bunch of them in the standard libraries and <code>Prelude</code>.</li>
<li>Some libraries, like <code>vector</code> (I'm getting to you, don't worry) make it <em>really</em> confusing by providing an <code>index</code> and <code>unsafeIndex</code> function. Hint: <code>index</code> isn't really safe, it's just less unsafe.</li>
<li>There's no obvious way to search for usages of these partial functions.</li>
<li>And, by far, the worst...</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="values-are-partial-too">Values are partial too!</h3>
<p>Only in a lazy language does this exist. You call a function. You get a result. You continue working. In any other non-lazy language, that means you have a value. If I have a <code>u32</code> in Rust, I actually have a <code>u32</code> in Rust. Null pointers in languages like C and Java somewhat muddy this situation, but at least primitive types are really there if they say they're there.</p>
<p>No, not Haskell. <code>x :: Int</code> may in fact not exist. It's a lie. <code>let x = head [] :: [Int]</code> is a box waiting to explode. And you find out <em>much</em> later. And it's even worse than that. <code>let alice = Person { name = "Alice", age = someAge }</code> may give you a valid <code>Person</code> value. You can evaluate it. But Cthulhu help you if you evaluate <code>age alice</code>. Maybe, just maybe, <code>someAge</code> is a bottom value. Boom! You've smuggled a dirty bomb out.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for removing laziness in Haskell. In fact I'm not really advocating for much of anything in this series. I'm just complaining, because I like complaining.</p>
<p>But <em>if</em> I was to advocate some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecate partial functions</li>
<li>Introduce a naming scheme for partial functions to be more obvious</li>
<li>Introduce a compiler warning to note partial function use (with a pragma to turn off specific usages)</li>
<li>Warn by default on partial pattern matches</li>
<li>Advocate strict data fields by default</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="but-ackshualllly-infinite-loops">But ackshualllly, infinite loops</h3>
<p>Someone's gonna say it. So I'll say it. Yes, without major language changes, you can't prevent partial functions. You can't even detect them, unless Turing was wrong (and I have my suspicions.) But Haskell community, please, please learn this lesson:</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD</strong></p>
<p>We can get rid of many of the most common partial functions trivially. We can detect many common cases by looking for partial pattern matches and usage of <code>throw</code> (again, horribly named function). "But we can't get everything" doesn't mean "don't try to get something."</p>
<h2 id="hubris">Hubris</h2>
<p>Given what I just said, we Haskellers have a lot of hubris. Each time you say "if it compiles it works," a thunk dies and collapses into a blackhole. We've got plenty of messes in Haskell that don't sufficiently protect us from ourselves. The compiler can only do as good a job as our coding standards and our libraries allow.</p>
<p>"But Haskell's at least better than languages like PHP." I mean, obviously I agree with this, or I'd be writing PHP. But since I'm being ridiculously hyperbolic here, let me make a ridiculous claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PHP is better than Haskell, since at least you don't get a false sense of security</strong></p>
<p><em>- Michael Snoyman, totally 100% what he actually believes, you should totally quote this out of context</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've said this so many times. So I'll say it again. Using a great language with safety features is one tiny piece of the puzzle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you get the software requirements right?</li>
<li>Did you leverage the type system to prevent the bugs you're trying to prevent?</li>
<li>Do your underlying libraries have bugs?</li>
<li>Did you find a way to implement a function with correct types but incorrect semantics?</li>
<li>Did you host the thing on a dinky server sitting under your desk and forget that you have power outages on a daily basis?</li>
<li>Did you forget to write a single test case?</li>
<li>Do your test cases actually test anything meaningful?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <em>so many ways</em> for software to fail outside the purview of the type system. We've got to stop thinking that somehow Haskell (or, for that matter, Rust, Scala, and other strongly typed languages) are some kind of panacea. Seriously: the PHP people at least know their languages won't protect them from anything. We should bring some of that humility back to Haskell.</p>
<p>Haskell provides me tools to help prevent certain classes of bugs, so I can spend more of my time catching a bunch of other bugs that I'm absolutely going to write. Because I'm dumb. And we need to remember: we're all dumb.</p>
<h2 id="more-partial-functions">More partial functions!</h2>
<p>You know what's worse than partial functions? Insidiously partial functions. We've all been screaming about <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> for years. My hackles rise every time I see a <code>read</code> instead of <code>readMaybe</code>. I can't remember the last time I saw the <code>!!</code> operator in production code.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of other functions that are just as dangerous, if not more so. More dangerous because they aren't well known to be partial. They are commonly used. People don't understand why they're dangerous. And they fail only in edge cases that people aren't thinking about.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: I present <code>decodeUtf8</code>. (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/kerckhove_ts/status/1321390954172063745?s=20">Syd</a>.)</p>
<p>Go ahead, search your codebase. Be dismayed that you've found it present.</p>
<p>What's wrong with <code>decodeUtf8</code>? As we established last time, character encoding crap breaks stuff in production. UTF-8 works about 99% of the time, especially for people in Western countries. You'll probably forget to even test for it. And that function looks so benign: <code>decodeUtf8 :: ByteString -&gt; Text</code>.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT BE FOOLED</strong></p>
<p>This function is a ticking time bomb. Use <code>decodeUtf8'</code> (yes, it's named that badly, just like <code>foldl'</code>) and explicitly handle error cases. Or use I/O functions that explicitly handle UTF-8 decoding errors and throw a runtime exception.</p>
<p>"I can't believe Michael still thinks runtime exceptions are a good idea." I'll get to that another time. I don't really believe they're a good idea. I believe they are omnipresent, better than bottom values, and our least-bad-option.</p>
<h2 id="law-abiding-type-classes">Law-abiding type classes</h2>
<p>Now I've truly lost it. What in tarnation could be wrong with law-abiding type classes? They're good, right? Yes, they are! The section heading is complete clickbait. Haha, fooled you!</p>
<p>There's a concept in the Haskell community that all type classes should be law-abiding. I've gone to the really bad extreme opposing this in the past with early versions of <code>classy-prelude</code>. In my defense: it was an experiment. But it was a bad idea. I've mostly come around to the idea of type classes being lawful. (Also, the original namespacing issues that led to <code>classy-prelude</code> really point out a much bigger bad part of Haskell, which I'll get to later. Stay tuned! Hint: Rust beat us again.)</p>
<p>Oh, right. Speaking of Rust: they do <em>not</em> believe in law-abiding type classes. There are plenty of type classes over there (though they call them <code>trait</code>s) that are completely ad-hoc. I'm looking at you, <code>FromIterator</code>. This is Very, Very Bad of course. Or so my Haskell instincts tell me. And yet, it makes code Really, Really Good. So now I'm just confused.</p>
<p>Basically: I think we need much more nuanced on this in the Haskell community. I'm leaning towards my <em>very</em> original instincts having been spot on. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Law abiding type classes: great</li>
<li>Flippantly non-law-abiding type classes ala the original <code>classy-prelude</code>: bad</li>
<li>"You know what I meant" typeclasses like <code>ToContent</code> in Yesod: also great</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't exactly in line with a "bad part" of Haskell. Up until now I've been giving a nuanced reflection on my journeys in Haskell. Let me try something better then. Ahem.</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LECTURE ME ON LAW ABIDING TYPE CLASSES AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE LAWS</strong></p>
<p>I'm staring at you, <code>Eq Double</code>. No, you cannot do equality on a <code>Double</code>. (And thanks again to Syd for this idea.) Rust, again, Got It Right. See <code>PartialEq</code> vs <code>Eq</code>. Floating point values do not allow for total equality. This makes things like <code>Map Double x</code> dangerous. Like, super dangerous. Though maybe not as dangerous as <code>HashMap Double x</code>, which deserves its own rant later.</p>
<p>So come down from your high horses. We don't have law abiding type classes. We have "if I close my eyes and pretend enough then maybe I have law abiding type classes."</p>

<p><span>B</span>y the time Mudassir Azeemi wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2014, he’d tried everything he<em> </em>could think of to make it easier to type in his native language, Urdu. In 2010, the now 42-year-old Pakistani-American developed a keyboard app you could use on iOS devices; within two years, it had been downloaded over 165,000 times. But even with an Urdu-language keyboard, the characters appeared on the screen in an entirely different font.</p>



<p>“Dear Mr Tim Cook,” he wrote. “Urdu language’s beauty lies in the typeface.”</p>



<p>Spoken by nearly 170 million people in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, Urdu is written in an alphabet derived from Arabic. But while Arabic is written in a script called <em>naskh</em>, simpler and more linear in its appearance, many other people — including Iranians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Urdu-speakers in India, and Uighur-speakers in parts of China — employ an ornate style of writing that originated in 14th-century Persia called <em>nastaʿlīq</em>. When Azeemi sat down to write his letter to Cook, nastaʿlīq was almost nowhere to be found online. To communicate in Urdu, you either had to type in naskh or spell words phonetically in Latin script.</p>



<p>Azeemi, a software developer now working and living in Silicon Valley, grew up in Pakistan’s sprawling seaside city, Karachi. As a teenager during the days of dial-up, he once racked up an internet bill that cost half of his father’s monthly salary; in his early 20s, he learned to code on one of those old calculator-sized computers called palmtops. He didn’t give much thought to Urdu’s digital future until he moved to California and became a father. Watching his children learn English through songs on YouTube, he’d felt a pang of loss — the anxiety that they might never speak or appreciate Urdu the way he does. One of the earliest apps Azeemi developed, even before the keyboard, was for nursery rhymes in Urdu.</p>



<p>These early attempts at yanking Urdu on to the internet hadn’t been particularly profitable — Azeemi says he lost over $50,000 in the process. He remained determined. In 2013, Apple introduced an Urdu keyboard for iOS devices, but, much to the chagrin of Urdu users, the default font was still naskh, the Arabic font. In Azeemi’s eyes, the solution was now pretty straightforward: operating systems — Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others — had to be persuaded to adopt nastaʿlīq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His open letter, addressed to Cook and Apple’s chief design officer at the time, Jonathan Ive, described the need for a nastaʿlīq font on iOS platforms. “The only hurdle for us is to bring the typeface that truly represent[s] the language,” wrote Azeemi. “And every language, when it is written, shines when using the typeface which it truly presented in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Urdu calligraphers speak of nastaʿlīq, it is with deep reverence. In the subcontinent, it was the script that disseminated the Quran, considered the word of God. Mir Ali of Tabriz, a 14th-century Persian calligrapher known as the father of the script, is said to have developed it after a dream in which Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, instructed him to draw letters that looked like “the wings of flying geese.” Squint at an Urdu verse in nastaʿlīq, and it might very well begin to resemble a flock of birds taking flight, or a branch in bloom. Nastaʿlīq characters, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/fromconcepttocon00fush/fromconcepttocon00fush_djvu.txt">per one observation</a>, appear to “swing from the upper right to the lower left of each word as if suspended by an imaginary line.”</p>



<p>In some ways, this emphasis on the <em>form</em> of writing a language runs contrary to conventional wisdom. We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning. If you could write the same Urdu word in the Arabic naskh script, even if it looked a little different — naskh is smaller, simpler, and sans serif — wasn’t the demand for digitized nastaʿlīq just a minor typographical quibble?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nastaʿlīq, after all, is a nightmare to code. It moves right to left, like all Arabic scripts, but also slopes downward: the longer the word, the steeper the slope. The shape of each letter changes, depending on the letter that comes before and after; in a 39-letter alphabet, there are thousands of permutations. Its multifaceted nature is precisely why coders haven’t developed nastaʿlīq fonts as easily as, say, Cyrillic.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It didn’t have to be this way. As early as 1951, just four years after wresting off British rule, Pakistan — where Urdu is both the official language and played a key role in the movement for independence — set up a national printing press that could compose in both English and Urdu, a substantial investment for the young, cash-strapped country and an indication, perhaps, of Urdu’s importance for its nation-building project. But even though Monotype and Linotype, the predominant printing technology firms of the time, kept developing typefaces for the Urdu market, local publishers kept rejecting them because they just didn’t match up to the local nastaʿlīq aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the reason nastaʿlīq ran into trouble was because the technology at the time — specifically the typewriter — was built with English in mind. Subsequently, as historian Thomas S. Mullaney notes in his book, “The Chinese Typewriter,” all other languages are seen as permutations from that norm. Hebrew is English but backward. Arabic is English backward and in cursive. Russian: English with different letters. Siamese: English with too many letters. Perhaps the only major language to escape the thumb of Latin hegemony was Chinese, a script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic, and thus <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/wubi-effect">had to be imagined entirely outside the box of existing technology</a>. But nastaʿlīq, presumably not quite significant enough to send typographers back to the drawing board, remained stalled until the 1970s, its mechanical rendering nowhere close to the sweep and flourish of the handwritten script.</p>



<p>In modern-day Iran, where nastaʿlīq originated, the font changed to meet the limitations of the existing technology. Over the years, Farsi slowly developed a typographical identity that worked within the constraints of the block printing press but was stylistically different enough from the Arabic naskh to feel sufficiently “Persian.” If you pick up a newspaper in Tehran today, it looks significantly different from a paper in Karachi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn’t Urdu, and Pakistan, go down a similar typographical route as Farsi did in Iran? Stubborn fidelity to nastaʿlīq aside, one reason may be the ways in which Urdu differed from other nastaʿlīq-favoring languages. One letter, “the <em>baṛī ye</em> (ے), is particularly influential on the look of written Urdu,” writes typographer and historian Titus Nemeth in “Arabic Type-Making in the Machine Age” (2017), “and its typographic rendering is among the most challenging design questions in an Arabic font.”</p>



<p>The baṛī ye, which resembles a bent elbow, produces all sorts of mechanical obstacles with regard to kerning and the placement of dots and diacritics. Baṛī ye and letters like it posed a problem that seemed so insurmountable, in fact, that, in the 1960s — mimicking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-06-25/some-turks-reconsidering-arabic-connection-turkish-language">mission to convert Turkish script into a Latin alphabet</a> — Pakistan’s military ruler Ayub Khan proposed officially writing Urdu in Latin letters. He was met with near-instant pushback: the nastaʿlīq script, protested local religious leaders, was an essential marker of Pakistan’s Islamic identity. Without meaningful progress in the printing process, Urdu publications in Pakistan, including dailies, continued to be written by hand well into the 1980s, armies of calligraphers scribbling furiously day and night.</p>

<p><strong>Ahmed Mirza Jamil,</strong> owner of a printing business in Karachi, inherited his love for nastaʿlīq from his father, who, in his later life, took up the daunting task of writing the Quran in his own hand. He’d completed only a third of the holy book before he fell ill and died, but his sons vowed to finish his cherished project. They photographed their father’s nine handwritten chapters, then cut and pasted his letter formations to piece together — like a jigsaw puzzle — the remaining two-thirds of the Quran. It was a staggeringly elaborate labor of love that took 14 years to complete. And it sowed the seeds for a long-awaited breakthrough in Urdu typesetting.</p>



<p>In 1980, Mirza Jamil wrote out every combination of Urdu letters that he could think of — roughly 20,000 by most accounts. These combinations, known as ligatures, became the basis of a new Urdu typeface: Noori Nastaliq, a font Jamil named after his father. It solved the difficulty posed by the shape-shifting nature of nastaʿlīq: instead of representing letters, it represented entire <em>combinations</em> of letters written together. The 20,000 ligatures were by no means exhaustive, but the chances of any other combination cropping up, Mirza Jamil reckoned, were negligible. He’d been inspired to address Urdu typographical troubles after encountering a Chinese keyboard, a 48-inch contraption with up to 500 characters, on a trip to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought, if the Chinese could do it,” he told a journalist in 1996, “so could we.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the advent of Noori Nastaliq, Mirza Jamil was hailed as Pakistan’s Gutenburg and bestowed with state honors. Urdu’s path to progress, <a href="http://elite.com.pk/epl/portfolio/noori-nastaliq/revolution/">one writer wrote</a>, “will be lit with the candle of Noori Nastaliq.” Still, adoption was tentative: for a while, according to the historian Nemeth, the country’s largest national newspaper, <em>Daily Jang,</em> carried typographically composed text alongside columns that were still handwritten, hoping to convince the nastaʿlīq purists that their beloved font could be printed too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, Noori Nastaliq remained the …</p></div></div>

		<p>Audio brings games and projects to life! Web developers have it easy, they can publish their apps on the web and play audio using the browser API no problem. However, what about those of us that are command-line and graphics apps in other languages? Repl.it is a special place on the web where you can publish any app in any language, but so far it’s been missing audio capabilities because code executes in a container on the backend. This summer, for my internship I set out to solve this problem and make it possible to play audio in any repl in any language. In this post I’ll show you how to play audio in your repl and then I will chronicle the journey that got us here. </p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/music-01.png" alt="music art"></p>
<h2 id="how-you-play-audio">How you play audio</h2>
<p>Before we get to the technical parts, let's talk about how you can use audio in your app or game.</p>
<p>As of this writing we support two libraries: Python and JavaScript. The Python library is built right in so you shouldn't need to install it. However, the JavaScript library you'll have to install and you can do that by simple importing (<code>@replit/audio</code>).</p>
<p>You can learn more on our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/audio">docs for audio</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a quick demo before I tell how it all works:</p>


<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>It started out with an idea, I wanted to add audio to Repl.it because I wanted to use it and many users were asking for it, so it seemed like a good project to take on.  To be honest, I thought it was going to be a lot easier than it turned out to be. I thought I’d just throw in a Pulseaudio stream over TCP, play it in the browser, and be done with it. I was wrong. But who would’ve thought that real-time audio streaming from an isolated Docker container using fake audio devices without the use of an always-on daemon would be difficult? I sure didn’t.</p>
<p>At first, my goal was to get something simple that worked. My first attempt was to use a combination of portaudio and loopback devices native to the host machine but isolated to each container but that didn’t end up working because the infrastructure was far too complicated to be maintainable and we’d have to install C libraries for each language so they could play audio. Moving on.</p>
<p>My second attempt was to prototype something so I could see how I could build the client. I wanted to make sure that I had at least one part of the setup correct.  For this attempt, I just searched for files named “PlayMeAudio.wav (or .aiff)” which would be decoded and sent to the client in a buffer when the client opened the repl. Although this worked, it was only a prototype and we didn’t ship it.</p>
<p>For my third attempt, I figured I’d decode the audio and relay that to the client via a pipe file. Although this worked, it was using a ridiculous amount of CPU in Python and just simply not fast enough. I had concerns it might be an issue in other languages as well.</p>
<p>For my final and fourth attempt, I made a request based system. Instead of decoding the audio files in userland and putting a strain on resources, I’d have the user language tell me which files to play, and we’d do the heavy lifting in Go, which is the language that we write the container service in, which we call PID1.  Although the code was a mess, it worked and ended up being the first version of audio we released to explorers, despite its many shortcomings.</p>
<p>Although it worked, this attempt had three issues: 
All files had to be at a sample rate of <code>44,000</code> hertz
All files had to have a bit depth of <code>32</code>
Only <code>.aiff</code> and <code>.wav</code> files were supported.</p>
<p>The reason for the first issue was that I couldn't find a good polyphase filter (for sample rate conversion) and I needed a C library to cross compile. This proved to be challenging, as we needed to static link it and it had libm as a dependency, which means we’d have to static link all of libc -- more on that later.  I ended up having to dynamically build it. Including its source wasn't an option because it had very large generated files, so I had to build it before we built PID1, more on this later on.</p>
<p>For the second issue, I really didn’t have an excuse other than not really understanding bit depth, but once I did I was able to quickly fix it.</p>
<p>For the third one, it wasn't so much that those files were the only ones supported - it was more so that we didn’t support <code>.mp3</code> files- for this, I ended up needing to use C again. I used minimp3 library and its Go bindings.</p>
<p>I also had plans to include <code>.opus</code> file support, so I was going to need another C library… Well to clarify, I needed both opus and opusfile. Opusfile requires opus, which requires OpenSSL, so I had to build OpenSSL the build opus and opusfile, without root. Well needless to say, this was starting to get a bit ridiculous to do more than once. I made a <a href="https://github.com/repl-it-discord/audio/">github repo</a> which would serve as a repo to house all the C libraries we needed along with the Go bindings, and I included a file I found from a source that would let me static link libm without all of libc. </p>
<p>After all of this, we have the dependencies resolved, and everything sounds good - except for one thing: Changes in audio take <code>~.74</code> -  <code>~1.48</code> seconds to take effect. Why? Well we were sending audio in chunks, instead of streaming. Every <code>~.74</code> seconds, we prepare audio and send exactly <code>32,768</code> samples (<code>2^15</code>, no particular reason for this magic number other than the buffer rarely runs out and the latency isn't unbearable) but this wasn't enough.  </p>
<p>The client was designed to append audio samples at the end of what it had scheduled, so what I did was send audio initially and then immediately send it again, so we’d give the client  <code>65,536</code> samples at the start, and send an additional <code>32,768</code> samples every <code>~.74</code> seconds. Where did I get <code>.74</code> seconds from? As we are playing the audio at <code>44,100</code> hertz, we play <code>44,100</code> samples per second - so <code>32,768/44,100</code>. </p>
<p>This setup was great for smooth audio, but I felt that the latency makes your repl experience feel rather shoddy. I mean, imagine you’re playing a game, you open the chest and go through a door. Once you go through the door, the sound from the chests plays because you as a user have that <code>.74</code> - <code>1.48</code> second buffer, which just makes using audio for games useless for anything other than background music.</p>
<p>So we had to rewrite this and unfortunately to solve the timing issue we had to complicate the solution. We made the server send overlapping buffers of samples and the client used a timing system along with a sample index the server sent to calculate and compensate for latency and try to make it “real-time” streaming.</p>
<p>Now I know this is hard to understand, in fact I was told it was also hard to code review, so I’ll do my best to illustrate it. </p>
<p>Normally, this is how our makeshift stream would look:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5
Message 2:         5 6 7 8 9 
Message 3:                 9 10 11 12 13
...</code></pre><p>This keeps us from audio cutting out due to (network) latency (to an extent), allowing us for smaller buffer sizes without as much (audio) latency</p>
<p>That alone isn't very special, what's really the star of the show is for the server to be able to send:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5  
Message 2:   2 3 4 5 6
Message 3:           6 7 8 9 10</code></pre><p>The client is where the difficult processing for this takes place, when we receive new samples we immediately stop playing and start playing those samples… well… mostly. </p>
<p>You see, there's still the one thing that we can’t control. Networking.  Maybe there's a <code>.1</code> second delay for one of the messages, well now look - we’re playing audio we already played!</p>
<p>So now the client has to calculate LATENCY too, which is even MORE difficult. At this point, we’re on multiple devices, and we need less than a <code>1/44,100</code> second difference in time in order to figure this out! That seemed too hard. Instead, what I did was give each message in the protocol the sample index of the first sample, i.e. the first message would have sample index <code>0</code>.  The client then determines how many samples the player has played in total and if that's greater than the sample index it will compensate for that by skipping samples. </p>
<p>Now too get back to the request system I mentioned earlier -- how does one use that? As I mentioned, there’s two libraries above for Python and JavaScript, however this should work for any language, and you’re free to implement your own libraries.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-libraries-work">How do libraries work?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, users can determine what is played via requests to a named pipe which PID1 reads.  I opted for a simple approach for encoding - json. While making libraries is fun and all, I can’t update libraries for many languages every time I change the requests, so I figured I’d make the request system pretty simple.</p>
<p>The user’s script must only write json data to <code>/tmp/audio</code> (a named pipe) and the go script will then parse the data and fulfill the request.  However, this might error - for example the file isn't found or has invalid encoding. Since we’re sending requests through a named pipe, we can't get errors very easily.
This means that the library the client uses must determine when there’s an issue with a source being created - the setup I made for the libraries which I used would wait up to a set amount of time then if the source wasn’t created in time it times out - while this isn’t always perfect, it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>A typical request to play a tone might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"Paused"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"Name"</span>: <span>"My tone"</span>,
  <span>"Type"</span>: <span>"tone"</span>,
  <span>"Volume"</span>: <span>1</span>,
  <span>"DoesLoop"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"LoopCount"</span>: <span>0</span>,
  <span>"Args"</span>: {
    <span>"Pitch"</span>: <span>400</span>,
    <span>"Seconds"</span>: <span>5</span>,
    <span>"Type"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"Path"</span>: <span>""</span>
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>A quick explanation of the above fields: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Paused</code> - Whether the source is paused or not - this can only be set when updating the source.</li>
<li><code>Name</code> - the name of the source - this can be used to identify the source when it's being created - if it's not set the name will be set by pid1.</li>
<li><code>Type</code> - the type of the source, supported types when I wrote this are:<ul>
<li><code>wav</code> - A <code>.wav</code> file</li>
<li><code>aiff</code> - A <code>.aiff</code> file </li>
<li><code>mp3</code> - A <code>.mp3</code> file</li>
<li><code>tone</code> - A generated tone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Volume</code> - The volume of the source as a floating point number - <code>1</code> would be <code>100</code>%</li>
<li><code>DoesLoop</code> - Whether the source should loop or not …</li></ul></div></div>

February 9, 2021 | https://blog.djy.io/how-i-deploy-my-personal-projects/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.djy.io/how-i-deploy-my-personal-projects/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Just for fun, here is a quick run-down of how I deploy my personal projects. If
you’re reading this and you have projects of your own that you might like to
deploy, then hopefully some part of this will be helpful to you.</p>



<p>Whenever I register a domain, I use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, not necessarily
because it’s the best option, but just because I’ve always found Namecheap to be
easy and intuitive, and it does everything that I need when it comes to
registering and managing domains.</p>

<p>Namecheap <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9434/10/using-default-nameservers-vs-hosting-nameservers/">gives you a few options</a> about what DNS
nameserver to use. Depending on the project, I use either their free, default
DNS service, or I choose the “Custom DNS” option and use DigitalOcean’s
nameservers if the project is hosted there. (I’ll say more about DigitalOcean
below.)</p>

<p>Namecheap also makes it straightforward to define <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/579/2237/which-record-type-option-should-i-choose-for-the-information-im-about-to-enter/">all kinds of host
records</a>. I’m pretty far from understanding what all of
the different kinds of records (A, AAAA, ALIAS, CNAME, NS, SRV, …) are for,
but I’ve learned just enough to be able to do the basic stuff that you usually
need to do when you’re building small websites and web applications.</p>



<p>Just as an aside: When I was a kid, I learned how to write HTML and CSS, built a
lot of stupid-looking websites, and put them up on the Internet for the world
(well, mostly just my friends) to see. This was the late 90’s and early 00’s,
and as far as I could tell at the time, the only way you could do this was to
keep a copy of your website on your computer and copy the files over to your web
space any time you make changes, using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> client. Git didn’t exist
yet, let alone GitHub Pages, and I couldn’t have told you what source control
was if you’d asked me. This felt alright to me at the time, but in retrospect,
it’s funny how painfully manual it was to deploy my websites back then.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it’s a lot easier these days to whip up a simple, nice-looking
website and make it publicly available on the Internet, even on a custom domain
with an SSL certificate.</p>

<p>When I first created this blog in 2014, I built it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and
deployed it via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. This was the path of least
resistance, as GitHub did (and still does) an excellent job of documenting how
to set up your own GitHub Pages site with Jekyll. I still think this is a pretty
nice setup for new programmers who want to get into building their own websites.</p>

<p>Fun fact: this blog is <em>still</em> built using Jekyll. I’ve re-styled the template a
few times, and I’ve migrated the site away from GitHub Pages, but as much as I’m
not crazy about Jekyll, it still gets the job done well enough that I have no
interest in building it all again using some other static website generator.
Maybe if I were to start over, I would explore other options that are available
now, like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or something. But for now, Jekyll is working out just
fine.</p>

<p>I mentioned just now that at one point, I migrated this site away from GitHub
Pages. That was because I found <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Netlify does a lot of
things, but the big thing they do is that they make it easy to automate
deploying your static sites for free. It’s trivial to take a site that you’re
deploying to GitHub Pages and convert it to use Netlify instead. Why would you
want to do that? Because Netlify gives you a lot more control over the way your
site is deployed. The reason I switched is that I ended up wanting to use some
Jekyll feature that will only work on newer versions of Jekyll, and I found that
with GitHub Pages, I couldn’t control the version of Jekyll that was used to
build the site. With Netlify, I can control pretty much everything about the
build, including which dependencies to bring in and what command to run to build
the site. Another awesome thing about Netlify is that they make it super easy to
set up your site to serve on a custom domain, and they’ll even generate an SSL
certificate for you automatically. After a quick and painless setup, you can
deploy your site by simply pushing commits to the default branch of your repo.</p>



<p>I first started using <a href="https://digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> as a way to explore having my
own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> that I could use to deploy arbitrary static sites and web
applications. I ended up only using my VPS to host static sites, which I now
realize was kind of pointless, because I could have just used Netlify to host
all of them, and it would have been a lot easier and more convenient. But it
really wasn’t pointless, because learning how to set up a VPS was a valuable
exercise in itself.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about setting up a VPS, I will say that it’s easy and fun to
do it with DigitalOcean. I paid $5 per month for a Droplet (i.e. server) that
ran 24/7 and could do anything I wanted. There are all kinds of useful things
that you can do with a VPS, but I ended up only using mine to host web pages and
other files. The setup for that was kind of interesting. I set up a wildcard
CNAME (<code>*.djy.io</code>) to direct to the IP address of my Droplet. Then, I followed
one of DigitalOcean’s guides to set up <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/">nginx</a> to serve the content from
various folders in <code>/var/www</code> (sites that I had written and uploaded to the
VPS). With this setup in place, I was able to create a new site whenever I
wanted by syncing the HTML and assets into a folder in <code>/var/www</code> and using a
simple nginx config file to specify which sites were to serve on which
subdomains (e.g. <code>something.djy.io</code>).</p>

<p>I got rid of the $5/month VPS once I figured out that I wasn’t using it for
anything that Netlify couldn’t handle for me in a much better way, and for free.</p>

<p>Lately, though, I have been using DigitalOcean again, to host an actual web
application. I built an API to provide information about new <a href="https://alda.io/">Alda</a>
releases, as part of the ground-up rewrite (Alda v2) that I’ve been working on
over the last couple of years.</p>

<p>There are two components to the Alda Releases API: the API server and the asset
storage. For the asset storage, I found DigitalOcean’s <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/">Spaces</a> to do
the job nicely. Spaces is an Amazon S3-compatible file storage service that is
affordable and has some nice features like a built-in CDN. I’ve set up a
<a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> automated build pipeline that uploads the executables to a
DigitalOcean Space whenever I push a release tag up to the GitHub remote. The
API server has a background thread that regularly checks for updates to the
executables in the Space so that it can provide up-to-date information about
Alda releases.</p>

<p>I deploy the Alda API using the DigitalOcean <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/">App Platform</a>, a
platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that automates building and deploying the
app every time I push a commit to my repo’s default branch. App Platform is very
new (it was only released to the general public four months ago, in October
2020), and accordingly has some rough edges, but overall, using it to deploy the
Alda API has been a nice experience. There is the usual trade-off with using any
PaaS product, which is that you don’t have to worry about infrastructure,
however, when something goes wrong, it can be difficult to see what’s going on
under the hood. For a simple, low-maintenance (and low-cost) application like
this one, I think the trade-off makes sense, but it’s not the kind of thing I
would do in my day job.</p>



<p>I hope you found this at least somewhat interesting!</p>

<p>This blog post is an in-depth dive into the security features of the Intel/Windows platform boot process. In this post I'll explain the startup process through security focused lenses, next post we'll dive into several known attacks and how there were handled by Intel and Microsoft. My wish is to explain to technology professionals not deep into platform security why Microsoft's SecureCore is so important and necessary.</p>



<p>We must first begin with a brief introduction to the hardware platform. Skip this if you have read the awsome material available on the web about the Intel architecture, I'll try to briefly summarize it here.</p>

<p>The Intel platform is based on one or two chips. Small systems have one, the desktop and server ones are separated to a CPU complex and a PCH complex (PCH = Platform Controller Hub).</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-19_14-3-0.png" alt="Intel architecture"></p>

<p>The CPU complex deals with computation. It holds the "processor" cores, e.g. Sunny Cove that implement the ISA, as well as cross core caches like the L3 cache, and more controllers that are grouped together as "the system agent" or the "uncore". The uncore contains the memory controller and display, e.g. GPU and display controller.</p>

<p>The PCH handles all other IO, including access to the firmware through SPI or eSPI, wifi, LAN, USB, HD audio, SMBus, thunderbolt and etc'. The PCH also hosts several embedded processors, like the PMC, the Power Management Controller.</p>

<p>An additional part of the PCH is a very important player in our story, the CSME, or Converged Security &amp; Management Engine, a i486 IP block (also called Minute IA). CSME is responsibly for much of the security model of Intel processors as well as many of the manageability features of the platform. The CSME block has its own dedicated ~1.5mb of SRAM memory and 128KB of ROM, as well as a dedicated IOMMU, called the A-Unit (that even has its own <em>acode</em> microcode) located in the CSME's <em>uncore</em>', thats allows access from ME to the main memory, as well as DMA to/from the main memory and using the main memory as an encrypted paging area ("virtual memory"). The CSME engine runs a customized version of the Minix3 microkernel, also recent versions have changed it beyond recognition adding many security features.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-19_14-14-4.png" alt="CSME structure"></p>

<h2 id="buses">Buses</h2>
<p>Lets use this post to also introduce the main interconnects in the system. The main externally facing interconnect bus is PCI-E, a fast bust that can reach 64GBps in its latest incarnations. A second external bus is the LPC, or Low Pin Count bus, a slow bus for connecting devices such as SPI flash, the TPM (explained below), and old peripherals such as PS/2 touchpads.</p>

<p>Internally the platform is based around the <strong>IOSF</strong>, or Intel On-chip System Fabric, which is a pumped up version of PCI-E that supports many additional security and addressing features. For addressing IOSF adds SourceID and DestID fields that contain the source and destination of any IOSF transaction, extending PCI-E Bus-Device-Function (BDF) addressing to enable routing over bridges. IOSF also extends addressing by adding support for multiple address root namespaces, currently defining three: RS0 for host memory space, RS1 for CSME memory space, and RS2 for the Innovation-Engine (IE), another embedded controller currently present only on server chipsets.
There are two IOSF busses in the PCH - the Primary Fabric and the Sideband Fabric. The Primary Fabric is high speed, connecting the CPU to the PCH (through a protocol call DMI), as well as high speed devices such as Gigbait Ethernet, WiFi and eSPI. The Sideband Fabric is used to connect the CSME to low-speed devices, including the PMC (Power Management Controller), the RNG generator, GPIO pins, USB, SMBus, and even debugging interfaces such as JTAG.</p>

<h2 id="more-components">More Components</h2>
<p>Another interesting component is the <strong>ITH</strong>, or Intel Trace Hub, which is codenamed North Peak (NPK). The ITH can trace different internal hardware component (VIA - Visualization of Internal Signals, ODLA - On-chip logic analyzer, SoCHAP - SOC performance counters, IPT - Intel Process Trace, AET - Intel Architecture Trace), and external component like CSME, the UEFI firmware, and you can even connect it to ETW. This telemetry eventually finds its way to Intel in various methods.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-22_0-52-2.png" alt="Intel Trace Hub"></p>

<p>The <strong>TPM</strong> is designed to provide a tamper proof environment to enforce system security through hardware. It implements in hardware many essential functions: sha1 &amp; sha256 hashing algorithms, many crypto and key derivation functions, measurment registers call the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), a secret key - Endorsment Key - used to derive all other keys, and non-volatile storage slots for storing keys and hashes. Discrete TPM chips (i.e. those that are a separate chip on the mainboard or SOC and connected through the LPC) are call dTPMs, or can be implemented in the CSME module's firmware and called fTPMs.</p>

<p>The TPM's <strong>PCR</strong> are initialized to zero when the platform boots and are filled up with measurements through the boot process. PCRs 0-15 are intended for "static" use - they reset when the platform boots; They are supposed to give the OS loader a view of the platform initialization state.
PCRs 17-22 are for "dynamic" use - they get reset on each secure launch (GETSEC[SENTER]); They are supposed to be used by the attestation sofware that checks if the OS is trusted.</p>

<h2 id="the-flash-chip">The Flash Chip</h2>
<p>SPI flash has 5 major regions: the Descriptor regions, the CSME region, the Gigabit Ethernet Region, the Platform Data Region, and the UEFI region. In the image below you can see an example of how the flash is organized.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-11_1-18-53_1.png" alt="Partition regions in SPI flash">
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-11_1-19-12.png" alt="Serial flash sizes"></p>

<p>Later versions added more regions:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2019-11-25_22-49-41.png" alt="SPI region evolution"></p>

<p>These regions are categorized as fault tolerant (FTPs) and non fault tolerant partitions (NFTPs).
Fault tolerant partitions are critical for boot, and verified during early boot (like the RBE, the CSME ROM Boot extensions will discuss in a few paragraphs). If verification fails - the system does not boot. Examples of non fault tolerant partitions are the Integrated Sensor Hub (or ISH) firmware.</p>

<p>SPI flash protection is applied at multiple levels: On the flash chip itself, in the SPI flash controller (in the PCH), in UEFI code and in CSME code.</p>

<p>The SPI controller maps the entire flash to memory at a fixed address, so reads/writes are usually done simply by reading/writing memory. The SPI controller translates this to flash-specific commands issued on the SPI bus, using a table of flash-specific commands stored in the flash descriptor region.
This is called "Hardware Sequencing", meaning the SPI controller issues the actual SPI commands
When hardware sequencing is in use, the SPI controller enforces several flash protections based on the masters region table in the flash (but can be overriden using a hardware PIN).</p>

<p>The SPI controller also implements a FLOCKDN flag. FLOCKDN is a write-once bit that, when set, disables use of software sequencing and modification of the PR registers until the next reset. The CSME sets this in the Bring-UP process (bup_storage_lock_spi_configuration(), see below). This happens when the UEFI notifies it that it is at the end of POST. In addition to the region access control table, the SPI controller also has an option to globally protect up to five regions in the flash from write access by the host using five registers, called Protected Registers (PRs), which are intended for the UEFI firmware to protect itself from modification while the OS is running.</p>

<p>It is also possible to issue direct flash commands using "Software Sequencing" by writing to the OPTYPE/OPMENU registers, since this can be used circumvent the SPI-enforced protections, software sequencing is usually disabled after POST using the FLOCKDN bit.</p>

<p>How is the flash updated?</p>

<p>UEFI region is updated through an UEFI capsule, This update happens during POST, before PRs and FLOCKDN is set, therefore, the BIOS region is still accessible to UEFI code.</p>

<p>Many OEMS have then own UEFI anti-tamper protections. For example, HP has SureStart on laptops and workstations, and Dell has TrustedDevice SafeBIOS. SafeBIOS copies bad firmware images to the EFI system partition, and the Dell Trusted Device software on Windows sends their hashes plus the hash of the UEFI firmware currently in memory to a Dell cloud server (*.delltrusteddevicesecurity.com) to check against a list of "authorized" hashes. Server platforms have similiar protections, including iLO for HP and iDRAC in Dell.
The CSME region can usually be updated only from within the CSME. However, for more complicated upgrades CSME can temporarily unlock the ME region for host read &amp; write.</p>


<p>In the next sections we'll look over all the stages of boot.
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/image2020-4-20_14-56-23.png" alt="Serial flash sizes"></p>


<p>Boot starts the PMC, the Power Management Controller.
In modern Intel systems the PMC is an ARC core and its the first controller to execute code once electricity is applied to the system. We'll talk more about PMC in a later post as its quiet interesting and has its own microcode and firmware, and event generates telemetry over the IOSF SB bus (which we'll talk about in a moment).</p>

<p>While the PMC does its init, the rest of the system is held at bay at a RESET state.</p>

<p>The next part to start running is the CSME. Recall from the first post in the series, CSME, or Converged Security and Managment Engine is a MinuteIA (i486 CPU IP block) embedded in the Platform Controller Hub (PCH).
The CSME begins running from its own embedded 128KB ROM - the CSME-ROM. This ROM is protected with a hardware fuse that is burned by Intel during production.
When started the CSME ROM starts like a regular 486 processor BIOS - in the reset vector in real mode. Its first order of business is to …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>

Ideally, there would have been an entry between this one and <a href="http://pete.akeo.ie/2011/06/extracting-and-using-modified-vmware.html">the last</a>, where I'd give you some pointers on how to disassemble the VMware BIOS we extracted using <a href="http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/">IDA Pro</a>. However, one of the points of this series is to explore ways of improving/revisiting the too often ignored x86 bootloader recovery process (a.k.a. <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.bios/25740/focus=26022">'panic room'</a>), that really ought to be part of any system boot operations. As such, we might as well jump straight into the fun by <b>creating a VMware BIOS from scratch</b>.</p><p>

Your first question might be <i>"Why would anyone want to craft their own BIOS from scratch (apart for an academical exercise)?"</i>. Well, in an ideal world, chipmakers such as intel and AMD <b>would</b> follow the example of the <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/">few SoCs manufacturers</a> <a href="http://www.ali.com.tw/index.php">who got it right</a> and provide both an UART and a small serial boot recovery ROM, <i>ondie</i>, to relegate the prospect of a non-functional system because of bad/uninitialized flash, to the footnotes of history. Alas, with CPUs well into their 4th decade of existence, that still hasn't happened. Therefore, to compensate for this missing feature, we'll have to implement such a feature ourselves, in the flash ROM, and that means writing a BIOS bootblock from scratch. And if you know how to write a BIOS bootblock, then you know how to write a complete BIOS. As to why one would actually want to replace a fully functional BIOS on <b>actual</b> hardware, just wait till you purchase a 3TB (or larger) HDD, or create a &gt;2TB RAID array, on an not so old machine, with the intent of booting Windows from it...</p><p>

Of course, crafting a fully featured BIOS, that can actually boot an OS, is something better left to large projects such as <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/">coreboot</a> with a payload of either <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS">SeaBIOS</a> or <a href="http://www.tianocore.org/">Tianocore</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">UEFI</a>), so we're not going to do that here. Instead, our aim will be to produce a very simple BIOS, that just does serial I/O, and that can be used as a development base for more interesting endeavours, such as 'panic room' type flash recovery, or regular BIOS instrumentation, to help with the development of an UEFI 'BIOS' for legacy platforms. Trying things out with a virtual machine, before jumping onto actual hardware, seems like the smart thing to do.</p><p>


<b>Know thy enemy, a.k.a. "Which SuperIO?"</b></p><p>

Hardware wise, the only subsystem we want to access then is the SuperIO chip, since it provides the (virtual) UART we are after. We're not going to bother about PCI, RAM, Video, or even Cache as RAM (CAR) access: just plain good old serial debug will do. And while I'm not going to go as far as saying that implementing the items listed above would be trivial, the fact is, as long as you have serial debug, at least you don't have to shoot in the dark, and that's big help.</p><p>

In the case of VMware, all you need to know is that the SuperIO is a (virtual) National Semiconductor PC97338 (<a href="http://pdf.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheet/nationalsemiconductor/PC97338.pdf">datasheet here</a>). Unfortunately neither coreboot's <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Superiotool"><code>superiotool</code></a> or <a href="http://www.lm-sensors.org/">lm-sensors</a>'s <a href="http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/man/sensors-detect"><code>sensors-detect</code></a> seem to detect it at the moment, which is quite unfortunate (Didn't someone mention they were porting coreboot/LinuxBIOS to VMware <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2007-March/019030.html">some time ago</a>? What happened?), as a lot of time was wasted on the SuperIO errand.</p><p>

And maybe I missed a step somewhere, but from what I can see, the VMware virtual chip is not set to run in PnP mode. Thus, what I'm going to expose in the code below with regards to accessing the serial port is very specific to the VMware PC97338 non-PnP implementation, and may not translate so well to SuperIO chips that run in PnP mode. Oh well... Also, if you disassemble the VMware BIOS, you'll see some mucking around with a SuperIO chip located at port <code>0x398</code> early in the bootblock, with <code>0x398</code> being one of the possible bases for the PC97338... Except the VMware SuperIO base is indeed at the <code>0x2e</code> location, so all that early stuff is a wild goose chase. Thanks a lot guys!</p><p>

Therefore, just to reiterate, all you need to know is that the VMware SuperIO is a PC97338, at port <code>0x2e</code> and running in non PnP mode. With that you can run along, and get going implementing early serial in your own BIOS.</p><p>


<b>Toolchain considerations and software constraints</b></p><p>

With the hardware in check, and before we start writing anything, it might help to have a look at our other requirements.</p><p>

First of all, as far as the development toolchain is concerned, and even more so as what follows is aimed at being usable by the largest number of people, we will use a GNU toolchain all the way. That means, as soon as you have a gcc setup on your platform that can produce x86 code, you should be good to go. And for the record, I have verified that the files I'm presenting below can produce a BIOS ROM on Windows, with either MinGW32, MinGW-w64 or cygwin, as well as Linux x86 or x64, with regular gcc. OSX (with a <b>proper</b> gcc toolchain) as well as cross compilers on other UNIX architectures are expected to work too. So if you don't have gcc setup on your system, go get it now!</p><p>

Then comes our choice of language. The coreboot and other projects seem to be quite adamant about developing as little as possible in assembly, but I don't see it that way for the two following reasons:</p><ol>
<li>We have no stack after reset but unless we plan on doing non 'panic room' type things, we <b>actually</b> don't have much use for one in the first place. From experience (<a href="https://github.com/pbatard/xtreamerdev/tree/master/rtdsr">with Realtek SoCs</a>) I can tell you that if your 'panic room' needs any form of memory to be initialized to be able to run, and that applies to Cache as RAM, you're not doing it right.</li>
<li>RAM space is infinite. BIOS bootcode blocks aren't. If there's one space you want to optimize it's that 4K or 8K BIOS recovery bootblock that you'll keep <b>and never re-flash</b> at the end of your BIOS. Flash manufacturers are providing features to help with flash recovery - make use of them dammit!!</li>
</ol><p>
Therefore, assembly it is.</p><p>

Now, the one caveat is that the GNU assembler seems to be the only tool still around defaulting to the AT&amp;T syntax which, while arguably more sensible than the intel one, nobody else, and especially not IDA, uses. Instead the intel syntax prevails. While this could have been an annoyance, any recent versions of GNU <code>as</code> also supports the Intel syntax, which can be be switched on in your code with <code>.intel_syntax noprefix</code>. Now that's better!</p><p>

Finally, we know we'll have to follow the following constraints:</p><ol>
<li>First instruction must be located at address <code>4GB-0x10</code> (or <code>FFFF:FFF0</code> if you prefer), and the whole BIOS must reside at the very end of the 32 bit address space. This is an x86 CPU initialization requirement</li>
<li>The processor starts in real address mode on reset. Another x86 reset constraint. Now, some people choose to switch to protected mode as soon as they can (so that they can use C), but we have optimization in mind, so we'll keep real address mode all the way.</li>
<li>The BIOS ROM size must be 512 KB. This time it's a VMware requirement.</li>
<li>We are also supposed to be careful about far jumps in our code, as another x86 boottime constraint. But that won't be an issue for a bootblock section of a few KB, which we plan to locate at the end of the BIOS anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>

<b>Producing a BIOS ROM</b></p><p>

Now we jump into the gory details at last.</p><p>

Since the reset vector is located at the end of the BIOS, we need to have at least two sections in our sourcecode: one that contains the bulk of our code, which I'll call <code>main</code> and which I'll <b>arbitrarily</b> set to start at 4 KB before the end of the ROM, and another, starting at <code>FFFF:FFF0</code> and going to the end of the ROM, which I'll call <code>reset</code> and whose only purpose will be to jump into our entrypoint in the <code>main</code> section.</p><p>

Below is an example of how one can establish these two sections in the assembly source, as well as the associated GNU <code>ld</code> script that ensures they will be located at the right destination address in the ROM. Because our BIOS is short, I'll use a single <code>bios.S</code> source for the code, and I'll call the <code>ld</code> script <code>bios.ld</code>. Hence <b>bios.S</b>:</p><pre>.section main
init:   &lt;insert useful code here&gt;
        ...

.section reset
        jmp init
        .align 16</pre><p>
NB: the <code>.align 16</code> at the end is there to ensure that the reset section is exactly 16 bytes. This way, we're sure that our <code>reset</code> section will occupy [FFFF:FFF0 - FFFF:FFFF] and we won't have to do extra padding.</p><p>

<b>bios.ld</b>:</p><pre>MEMORY { ROM (rx) : org = 4096M - 512K, len = 512K }
SECTIONS { 
        .main 4096M - 4K    : { *(main) }
        .reset 4096M - 0x10 : { *(reset) }
        }</pre><p>
As you can see above, the ld script simply sets the ROM to be 512 KB in size, located at the end of the 4 GB (=4096M, since GNU <code>ld</code> doesn't know the G suffix yet) and, as indicated, we placed our bootcode segment (<code>main</code>) to start at the last 4 KB block of ROM. <br>
The script should sort out our addresses as we want them then, and once <code>ld</code> has churned through it and produced a new object file (which I'll call <code>bios.out</code>), we should be able to use <code>objcopy</code> with option <code>-j</code> to extract the various binary payloads of interest to us.</p><p>

Now, the problem is that <code>objcopy -j</code> will only extract the payload data. We could of course use a trick like<code>.align 4K-0x10</code> at the end of our main section, but that would mean we'd then have to edit our bootcode size in two separate files when we update it. The smarter approach is to use the <code>--gap-fill</code> option of <code>objcopy</code>, to conveniently fill any gap between sections <code>main</code> and <code>reset</code>.</p><p>

Another problem we face is that the above script only produces the binary data starting with the 4K at the end of the ROM, since the first section we extract (<code>main</code>) starts there. So at most objcopy will create 4 KB of data, far from the 512 KB we actually need. The solution: create a dummy section in our source, which I'll call <code>begin</code> and which I'll also use to put a BIOS ID string, and tell <code>ld</code> either explicitly, or better simply with a <code>&gt;ROM</code> directive (so that we don't have to fill in the ROM size a 3rd time in the script) where it should reside. </p><p>

After that, if we extract the <code>begin</code>, <code>main</code> and <code>reset</code> sections in order, with the <code>--gap-fill</code> option, we should have a 512 KB binary file with everything mapped where it should be. Neat!</p><p>

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>

<p>Zhazgul Zuridinova hikes for fun almost every month, but trekking the narrow mountain pass to Zardaly, a remote village near Kyrgyzstan’s southwest border, still makes her anxious. The 12-kilometer trail carved through the barren rocks is unpaved and bridged by wooden planks. One misstep could send her tumbling down the steep cliffs, a fate that has befallen many locals over the years.</p>



<p>“Zardaly is a place that no one goes to,” said Zuridinova, a 28-year-old project manager from Bishkek, the capital. “They don’t have the internet or electricity. While all the world is changing, they’re still living in the past, like a hundred years ago.”</p>



<p>It was Zardaly’s isolation that brought Zuridinova, two colleagues, and a donkey there last November. All three are employees of the Internet Society, a nonprofit that builds community broadband networks and teaches digital literacy around the world. Their aim was to bring the internet to the local school’s dozen students — who had been cut off from education during the coronavirus pandemic — using a tissue-box-sized digital library called Ilimbox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ilimbox, whose name translates to “science in a box,” stores 500 books, 250 videos, and 4 million Wikipedia articles in Kyrgyz, Russian, and English. The device is only an interim solution for the lack of an internet connection — a thin facsimile of being online, but it has become a lifeline for students in the most remote areas of Kyrgyzstan, who faced being left behind <a href="https://www.unicef.org/kyrgyzstan/stories/lights-camera-action">when the country moved to e-learning last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a window for a person who wants to access knowledge,” Zuridinova said. “It’s not the door.”</p>



<p>Building internet infrastructure has been a great challenge in Kyrgyzstan, which is further away from an ocean than any other country in the world and is almost entirely mountainous — 94% of the country lies at over 1,000 meters altitude. That makes laying cables expensive and difficult. <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/asia.htm#kg">More than 60% of Kyrgyzstan’s population</a> is still not covered by any form of internet, and those with a connection are concentrated in a handful of urban areas.</p>



<p>Talant Sultanov, co-founder of the Internet Society’s Kyrgyzstan chapter, first came across the concept of the “internet-in-a-box” when he attended the 2016 Internet Governance Forum in Mexico. The devices — repositories of downloaded internet content that can be accessed by offline communities — were being used <a href="https://vimeo.com/195038843">to connect indigenous communities in the Yucatán peninsula</a>.</p>



<p>“That’s when it occurred to us that, in Kyrgyzstan, we had a similar situation,” Sultanov said. “And that’s when we decided to also apply this experience in Kyrgyzstan and bring the internet-in-a-box to schools and libraries in remote areas.”</p>



<p>With funding from international organizations and an endorsement from the Ministry of Education, the project team — which most of the time comprised Zuridinova and one other engineer — created an Android app and assembled the boxes using low-cost microcomputers and hard drives. When connected to a power source, the Ilimbox becomes a local Wi-Fi hot spot, which students can use to install the app and download the content stored on the drive. The app also functions as a PDF reader and video player, so there’s no need to download other apps.</p>

<p>Even though there is no data network in rural Kyrgyzstan, many people there have Android smartphones, which are often brought in by Kygrgyz migrant workers living in neighboring countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choosing content was a challenge. Schools in rural Kyrgyzstan have suffered from a lack of textbooks and other learning materials in the local language. Higher education institutions increasingly prefer to use Russian or English. “[Rural schools] have to share books or get worn-out books, if they’re lucky. And oftentimes they don’t even have that,” Sultanov said. That didn’t give the Internet Society much to work with. “There really wasn’t much to choose from, so we were happy just for any content,” Sultanov said. “We’re beggars, not choosers.”</p>



<p>Wikipedia has been a surprisingly important source of their material. There are currently more than 80,000 articles on the Kyrgyz version of the site, the majority of which were written after 2010 in <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">an effort </a><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">organized</a> <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">by Kyrgyzstani social worker Chorobek Saadanbekov</a>, who mobilized academics and college students to translate Wikipedia articles from other languages. Saadanbekov said he was motivated by his own experience of growing up in the countryside and receiving education in only Kyrgyz. “And now I have hopes in our country,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>, “that if you only speak Kyrgyz, you can [still] access knowledge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between 2017 and early 2020, the Internet Society delivered Ilimboxes to around 100 schools across the country. But the urgency of their efforts increased dramatically last March, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced schools across the country to close. In August, the Ministry of Education announced that, of all public schools in Kyrgyzstan, 2,106 were already connected to the internet, while the state-owned telecommunications company was laying fiber optic cables for 11 more. Twenty schools, however, would be left out, either because they had no electricity or there were plans to resettle villagers in the future.</p>



<p>“When we learned that,” Sultanov said, “we took it as a challenge and a goal — that we should definitely go to these villages first.”</p>



<p>The school in Zardaly was on the list. The village has around 100 families but no electricity, fixed internet, or mobile data. On November 2, Zuridinova and two colleagues arrived at Zardaly after hours of driving and walking. They brought with them an Ilimbox, a big solar panel, some batteries, and two solar-powered streetlamps. The digital library was placed in the primary school, the only public institution in the village, and 11 students between 7 and 12 came to learn how to use it.</p>



<p>Many older students already had a smartphone, but the team had learned in advance that the only girl in the school, Raiana, didn’t. So, two weeks before the trip to Zardaly, they posted a request on Facebook asking if someone could donate a used handset. A woman saw the post, cleaned and repaired her phone, and sent it to the Ilimbox team. “Thank you, sister,” said Raiana, holding the phone and the Ilimbox in a video recorded by Zuridinova. “I took the phone. I will study hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Chakmak-Suu, another village on the list, a cell tower put up four years ago offers relatively stable mobile connections. There, Aitunuk Talaibekova, a 15-year-old student, has been able to send homework to her teachers over WhatsApp and conduct searches on Google. However, most of the information she finds online is in Russian.</p>



<p>Because she reads much quicker in Kyrgyz, her native language, she had to use a physical dictionary to translate material she didn’t understand. The Ilimbox, installed in her school in October, gave her access to all the Krygyz language content scattered around the internet and put it in one place.</p>



<p>“Learning has become more interesting for me,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>. “I used Wikipedia to study the biographies of historical figures, authors, and poets, for example, to find their poems that we had in our lessons.” She also uses it to look up textbooks, so she can help her younger siblings with their homework.</p>



<p>With the last of the remote schools connected in November, the Ilimbox team is now planning to expand the program to include Kyrgyzstan’s <a href="https://www.akdn.org/project/bringing-kindergarten-high-pastures">recently created <em>jailoo</em> kindergartens,</a> which allow thousands of children to receive preschool education while they keep an eye on grazing sheep in the pastures. Zuridinova and her colleagues decided to include the jailoos after realizing that the Ilimboxes could work without access to the electrical grid.</p>



<p>Zuridinova says that, the next time they visit Zardaly, she wants to bring the real internet to the village. “We thought about going there to teach [them] how to use Booking.com for tourists, how to use e-commerce websites,” she said. “Not only bringing the internet there, but also teaching [them] how to use it for work, study, and other things.”</p>

	<div><p>My take: it’s an app where you can listen to and sometimes join people having conversations about topics that might interest you. You do this by joining <em>rooms</em>, which are temporary spaces where a conversation is taking place around a certain topic. Rooms have moderators, who can invite speakers on the <em>stage</em>. You can raise your hand if you have something to add to the conversation and the moderator will invite you to the stage at their own discretion.</p><p>I have joined a few rooms, heard some interesting conversations, and in general, it has been fun. <strong>However, has it been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clubhouse-audio-social-app-venture-capitalists-hype-during-quarantine-2020-4">$100 million valuation</a> kind-of-fun</strong>? </p><p>I’m not sure.</p><p>My biggest problem: <strong>the current core value experience only works with</strong> <strong>real-time</strong> <strong>interaction/attention.</strong></p><p>My hypothesis is that <strong>Clubhouse is essentially a (user-generated) content network, not a social network.</strong></p><p>It might be a <em>social</em> app, where social interactions happen, but I see very little relationship building happening, which is an essential component of a social network. The nodes in a social network should have the opportunity to independently connect to each other, and have (<em>at least the possibility for</em>) a meaningful interaction.</p></div><figure><img src="https://www.sjurd.com/content/images/2021/02/classic-social-network-1.jpg"></figure><p>In Clubhouse, <strong>meaningful interactions</strong> only occur within rooms and are routed through the people on <em>stage</em>. You can follow someone, also from the audience, but you can’t send them a private message or have any other meaningful interaction with them. I guess you can start a private room and only invite that person, but the bar for that seems extremely high. So in essence, the majority of the nodes in the network can’t connect directly, but are routed through main nodes who are the creators and speakers of the rooms.<br></p><figure><img src="https://www.sjurd.com/content/images/2021/02/Clubhouse-content-network.jpg"></figure><p>Is that a problem? I’m not sure. But I would argue it disqualifies Clubhouse as a social network.</p><div><p>So, if we accept that Clubhouse is just a content network, then it faces a big challenge: <strong>distribution</strong>.</p><p>We have to give credit to how elegantly Clubhouse has solved the content creation problem through user generation: no shortage of people who love to hear themselves talk.</p></div><div><p>But, if you’re not the one doing the talking: what is the value interaction that you can get? </p><p>That’s right. <strong>Listening</strong>. Listening to a meaningful conversation.</p><p>And in Clubhouse, you can only listen<em> live</em>, in real-time, while the room is “alive”.</p><p>This is the core of the problem. Demanding real-time goes against a macro-development in our world: <strong>the move to asynchronous/on-demand delivery. </strong> <br>All other content networks (even TV and radio) have moved or are rapidly moving towards asynchronous and/or on-demand delivery, so that you can enjoy the content in your own time. Netflix, Hulu anyone? As consumers of content we no longer have to schedule our life around our content consumption, e.g. X-files (yeah, I’m that old) only on Tuesday at 10PM. Instead, we decide when we consume it.</p></div><div><p>And in fact, most, if not all other social networks have moved to a similar distribution model. All of the meaningful interactions on Twitter you can enjoy in your own time. A tweet from 18 hours ago, not a problem, here it is. Your experience of that tweet, in most cases, is exactly the same quality, as if you would get it in real-time. Facebook switched to showing relevancy-based content years ago, rather than keeping chronological order. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-time/">On TikTok time does not even exist</a>.</p><p>Clubhouse however demands real-time. And, unlike many other social networks, you can’t just pop-in and out, or scroll through it while paying half-attention to something else, or even while being in a conversation with someone. It demands full attention.</p><p>We can have long discussions on whether or not the move to on-demand and bite-sized content is a positive development, but it does seem to be where the world is going.</p><p>Clubhouse seems completely antithetical to those developments.</p><p>This contrarian move could be a stroke of genius: a move early into a direction that not a lot of people are seeing this going. I’m not a futurist, and healthily skeptical of some new developments, so this wouldn’t be the first, nor the last time that I am completely wrong.</p><p>But my best bet right now is that after the initial excitement wears off, and the scarcity marketing play has run its course, not many people are willing to adjust their life to listen in on the type of conversations we are seeing now. I doubt we will see the average user spending “more than a dozen hours per week”, like Andrew Chen. </p></div><p>Still, without monetization in place, it's difficult to say what is needed to make $100M a good bet. But to me the current model doesn't seem to be it.</p>

<p>The <code>ndarray</code> crate provides us with a multidimensional container that can contain general or numerical elements. If you're familiar with Python, then you can consider it to be similar to the <code>numpy</code> package. With <code>ndarray</code> we get our $n$-dimensional arrays, slicing, views, mathematical operations, and more. We'll need these in later sections to load in our datasets into containers that we can operate on and conduct our analyses.</p>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Dimensions">Dimensions<a href="#Dimensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>It's often the case that we need to find out the dimensionality of our arrays. There are many ways to do this, and the following contains some of the common approaches.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h3 id="From-Length">From Length<a href="#From-Length">¶</a>
</h3>
<p>We can use <code>Array.len()</code> to return the shape along a single axis.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>This is simple enough if we have a one-dimensional array. However, for higher dimensions, we can see that for a <code>len()</code> returns the flattened length.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>If we want to get the length along one of the axes instead, e.g. the second one, we can use <code>Array.len_of(Axis(n))</code></p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h3 id="From-Shape">From Shape<a href="#From-Shape">¶</a>
</h3>
<p>Another approach is to use <code>Array.shape()</code> which returns more information.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can see it has returned an array that indicates the length along all of our axes. This can be indexed to get the length along a specific axis.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div>

<div>
<p>Like most data structures, the indexing starts at $0$. To access the first element in our one-dimensional arrays we can do the following.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>For higher dimensions, we need to use a primitive array.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>Likewise, to access the second element in our one-dimensional arrays we need to index with $1$.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>Again, for our higher dimensions, we use a primitive array..</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>To select the last element in our one-dimensional arrays we can index with <code>Array.len() -1</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[18]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>data_1D</span><span>[</span><span>data_1D</span><span>.</span><span>len</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>But for our multidimensional arrays we need to use a primitive array and use <code>Array.len_of(Axis(n))</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[19]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>data_2D</span><span>[[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>data_2D</span><span>.</span><span>len_of</span><span>(</span><span>Axis</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]]</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Alternatively, we could use <code>Array.shape()[n]</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[20]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>data_2D</span><span>[[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>data_2D</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>]]</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>Let's look at some common mathematical operations that can operate on our arrays.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>All elements in an array can be summed with <code>sum()</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We may instead wish to sum all elements along a specific axis in an array, e.g. the first axis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[22]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>data_2D</span><span>.</span><span>sum_axis</span><span>(</span><span>Axis</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[22]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[5.0, 7.0, 9.0], shape=[3], strides=[1], layout=CF (0x3), const ndim=1</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[23]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>data_2D</span><span>.</span><span>sum_axis</span><span>(</span><span>Axis</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[23]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[6.0, 15.0], shape=[2], strides=[1], layout=CF (0x3), const ndim=1</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>It's quite common to apply mathematical operations to each element of an array. Let's have a look at some examples.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can add values, e.g. $1.0$, to every element.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[24]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
 [5.0, 6.0, 7.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>We can also add the elements of one array to another.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[25]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[2.0, 4.0, 6.0],
 [8.0, 10.0, 12.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Finally, we can add a one-dimensional array to a two-dimensional array.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[26]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[2.0, 4.0, 6.0],
 [5.0, 7.0, 9.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>When summing two arrays together they don't need to have the same shape, but their shapes must be compatible. This means we should be able to broadcast one array across another, i.e. they must be identical in the size of at least one dimension.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can subtract values, e.g. $1.0$, from every element.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[27]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[0.0, 1.0, 2.0],
 [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>We can also subtract elements of one array from another.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>

    <p>Out[28]:</p>

 [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Finally, we can subtract a one-dimensional array from a two-dimensional array array.</p>
</div>

 [3.0, 3.0, 3.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can multiply every element by a value, e.g. by $2.0$.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[30]:</p>

 [8.0, 10.0, 12.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>We can also multiply every element of one array by another.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>

    <p>Out[31]:</p>




<div>
<pre>[[1.0, 4.0, 9.0],
 [4.0, 10.0, 18.0]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=C (0x1), const ndim=2</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can divide every element by a value, e.g. by $2.0$.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can also divide every element of one array by another.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We can raise the elements in an array to a power, e.g. of $3.0$.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>If you turn to</strong> great works in moral philosophy to find out when complaining is permissible, youâ€™ll get a â€˜neverâ€™. Complaining is not recommended by philosophers. Many <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-duty-to-resist-9780190872199?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">defend</a> political protest, and some <a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/complaint/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">defend</a> the â€˜constructive complainingâ€™ that contributes to making the world better, but ordinary griping about subjective pains should never be done. It doesnâ€™t change anything, or so the argument goes.</p>
<p>I disagree with most philosophers (although Iâ€™m not alone), and I defend the form of complaining thatâ€™s not seen as productive. I suspect that our reports of our pains can be more socially beneficial, even more morally generous, than naysayers think. Of course, not all complaints are equal and not all contexts are great. Complaining <em>well</em> is a complex skill, to be exercised more than never and less than excessively.</p>
<p>When I said this in an <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/sunday/the-sunday-edition-for-october-27-2019-1.5335017/how-complaining-can-actually-bring-us-closer-together-1.5335023?x-eu-country=false" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">interview</a>, the host described people who reply to the most casual â€˜How are you?â€™ with a catalogue of their pains as â€˜a menaceâ€™. I had to laugh. Complaining can be thoughtless, and it can be unwelcome. But complaining can also be thoughtful. At times itâ€™s so useful to a situation that I describe it as an <em>affective duty</em>. That means that there are times when we ought to be sensitive and attuned to the emotional environment and offer a complaint as a way of offering an opportunity for solidarity. You ought not to act as if no one has anything in common with you and, instead, you ought to extend your vulnerability and say: â€˜Let us share it.â€™</p>
<p>To observe the duty to complain, we need skills of complaining well. And to do any skill excellently, we need to practise, so that we know what occasions call for complaining. Such occasions include times when you think you could help someone else and invite them to complain because you think they need to. My journal <a href="https://philarchive.org/archive/NORCC-2v1" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">article</a> â€˜Canâ€™t Complainâ€™ (2018) includes the example of two coworkers plodding from opposite directions in a cold rain. They step inside, shivering, and one says: â€˜Awful weather weâ€™re having!â€™ The point is to open that interpersonal door so that the other person feels free to complain. It is friendly but, more importantly, itâ€™s a recognition that someone might need to disclose that theyâ€™re uncomfortable or vulnerable, if only to the weather. Some might refrain from complaining merely because theyâ€™re polite, but they might also refrain because they donâ€™t think youâ€™ll agree. Offering the opening complaint is a way of indicating that youâ€™ll agree. Itâ€™s <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.co.uk/content/hewstonesocialpsychology/chapters/chapter9.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">prosocial</a>.</p>
<p>If you complain and no one affirms you, youâ€™ll feel worse</p>
<p>This affective duty can also be towards oneself â€“ a duty to complain so that weâ€™re not misrepresenting ourselves. We donâ€™t associate quotidian gripes with authenticity, but letting people know that youâ€™re not perfect, that you, too, suffer from some things that others might be suffering from, can indicate a healthy self-awareness. In complaining well, weâ€™re both honest about who we are and helpful to other people who might need to know that theyâ€™re not alone. It might take personal courage to admit that one is in pain or vulnerable, but itâ€™s important to our own wellbeing to find that weâ€™re not alone.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, complaining excessively</strong> or inaptly risks making others worse off instead of binding us together. Everyone knows someone who complains <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300209747/complaining-teasing-and-other-annoying-behaviors" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">too much</a>. And because we all know someone who complains too much, it seems obvious that complaining to excess is bad. It can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.10095" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">effect</a> a kind of mood contagion where your complaint brings other people down rather than allowing them to help you. And in some roles, people depend on us to be the recipients of complaining and to not return the feelings in kind. So the good life requires complaining to the right people, in the right amounts, for the right reasons.</p>
<p>That sounds like Iâ€™m saying complaining is a virtue but, at best, itâ€™s what the philosopher Lisa Tessman <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195179145.001.0001/acprof-9780195179149?rskey=80wv7b&amp;result=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">called</a> a â€˜burdened virtue<em>â€™</em>. In an ideal society, you wouldnâ€™t have to complain much because there wouldnâ€™t be much to complain about â€“ weâ€™d all be healthy, happy and well-supported. Instead of being a virtue, complaining is more like the skill of people who are really successful at sociality, who know when to share themselves, when to help others, and when to contribute to a relationship.</p>
<p>It is, by nature, risky. Psychological <a href="http://journals.pan.pl/Content/107612/PDF/38.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> suggests that if you complain and someone confirms your complaint â€“ not agrees with you, just acknowledges (â€˜That sounds hard; you sound like youâ€™re sufferingâ€™) â€“ then that affirmation lifts your mood higher than it was before you complained. But if someone doesnâ€™t affirm you, your mood is lower than ever. Itâ€™s bad news that, if you complain and no one affirms you, youâ€™ll feel worse. But it reveals the times when complaining is better â€“ that is, when you have reason to believe that thereâ€™s an opportunity for someone to affirm you.</p>
<p>Complaining helps ameliorate isolation and helps people bond. It reduces our loneliness and reveals us to each other in a way that can build relationships. I worry that social structures and workplaces are often set up to isolate us. I worry about students of mine who go into service professions and jobs with high risk of burnout ceasing to care about other people. Employers canâ€™t help but prefer that weâ€™re without complaints. Better that we show up every day, never miss work, and never give in to our feelings when weâ€™re caring for the vulnerable or trying to sell something or trying to conduct business. But I think the fact that our workplaces tend toward, intentionally or not, exploiting and isolating workers is all the more reason to make a space for telling each other that sometimes itâ€™s important to complain â€“ not just to make the workplace better, but to build relationships in workplaces where we can trust each other to understand when weâ€™re having a bad day.</p>
<p>If someone apologises for complaining, theyâ€™re saying, implicitly, that their listener shouldnâ€™t complain in turn</p>
<p><strong>All the topics I</strong> write on ultimately return to the same fact: we live in a nonideal world. It would be hard to describe many people as so powerful that they have nothing to complain about. Most people are simply in differently constrained positions and, when they share similar positions, complaining gets them together â€“ not to make the world a better place, but to help each other bear up under it better.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s the job of ethics, the job of life â€“ to be happy anyway because we have robust capacities for happiness. We just have to figure out how to exercise them in a nonideal world. The â€˜Likeâ€™ button on social media platforms took off in part for this reason, that we are so unconsciously searching for affirmation, so naturally hungry for it. And the more we work remotely, or precariously, the more we commute, or see no one at all, the less chance we have to get affirmation of how we feel.</p>
<p>I would be remiss not to note that there are ways to complain badly, even when turning to people as friends whom you think you can trust with a complaint. One mistake is to include an apology for complaining in every complaint. At moments when you need to contribute to your relationship or disclose your pain, routinely apologising for complaining is not skilful. Doing so implies that we all agree that complaining is bad. But if someone apologises for complaining, theyâ€™re saying, implicitly, that their listener shouldnâ€™t complain in turn. Thatâ€™s going to continue to maintain a culture that says none of us should be complaining. I worry for people I know who start complaints on social media with the statement that they know other people are worse off, <em>but</em>â€¦ I want to encourage people to recognise that no oneâ€™s life is free of suffering. No one is untouched by trouble, and therefore everybody gets to complain a little. We should help each other be vulnerable together. Weâ€™re stronger together, even when we feel like weâ€™re not strong.</p>
<p>Skilled affirmation takes practice. This means developing a friendship on purpose, where you say: â€˜I believe that you are someone I can trust and to whom I can occasionally complain.â€™ We tend not to think of developing friendships as a practice. But, as Aristotle says, friendships are like good habits: they bear cultivating. For example, social media helped me deliberately enter some small, close-friend networks where we agree to check in with each other regularly, ask each other how weâ€™re doing, and give each other honest answers.</p>
<p>I know social media doesnâ€™t always seem to encourage that because so much of it is pictorial. What it encourages is putting up the best possible photos of yourself, your family, and your dog. But we need this other thing, too â€“ and weâ€™re bad at it, so we ought to practise it all the more. So consider some skill-building homework: find a trusty person and tell them explicitly: â€˜I want you to hear a complaint of mine and just let me know if you share it.â€™ Build that trust network, one person at a time, and try to start complaining excellently.</p></div></div></div>]]>

February 9, 2021 | https://psyche.co/ideas/pseudophilosophy-encourages-confused-self-indulgent-thinking | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/ideas/pseudophilosophy-encourages-confused-self-indulgent-thinking">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>There are many kinds</strong> of pseudosciences: astrology, homeopathy, flat-Earthism, anti-vaxx. These â€˜fieldsâ€™ traffic in bizarre claims with scientific pretensions. On a surface level, these claims <em>seem</em> to be scientific and usually appear to comment on the same kind of things that science does. However, upon closer inspection, pseudoscience is revealed to be <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-bullshit-is-no-laughing-matter" rel="noopener">bullshit</a>: it is indifferent to the truth. Analogous to pseudoscience, can there be such a thing as pseudophilosophy, in which one makes claims with philosophical pretensions which on closer inspection turn out to be bullshit? I think there is.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s begin with the concept of pseudophilosophy. If there is something deserving of that name, then it would be deficient with respect to philosophical issues in the same way that pseudoscience is deficient with respect to scientific issues. So, in order to get a grip on pseudophilosophy, we should first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/theo.12271" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">look</a> more closely at the way in which pseudoscience is deficient, and then see whether we can find something analogous in the philosophical domain.</p>
<p>What makes pseudoscientific beliefs deficient is that theyâ€™re formed in an <em>epistemically unconscientious</em> way. Thatâ€™s to say, these beliefs are made from culpably confused and uninformed reasoning. For example, the belief that the Earth is flat can be sustained only by self-willed disregard of the massive amounts of evidence to the contrary, accumulated over several centuries by several different sciences.</p>
<p>However, such unconscientiousness doesnâ€™t presuppose insincerity or charlatanry. A charlatan is someone who has a hidden, usually profit-seeking, agenda and who is fundamentally indifferent to whether their beliefs are true. Often bullshit is produced without such insincerity, however, since one can <em>care</em> about the truth of oneâ€™s beliefs without <em>taking care</em> with respect to it.</p>
<p>A problem is that most of us are lacking in epistemic conscientiousness, at least sometimes and to some extent. In order for something to count as pseudoscience, some minimal degree of unconscientiousness is therefore required. A good rule of thumb for being conscientious is to keep an eye out for classical fallacies such as <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/how-ad-hominem-arguments-can-demolish-appeals-to-authority" rel="noopener">ad hominem</a>, straw man, false dilemma and cherry-picking. Such fallacies occur in all kinds of contexts, but in pseudoscience they occur more systematically.</p>
<p>Whether there is a God or whether there are objective moral truths have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all</p>
<p>Epistemic unconscientiousness is an essential but not exhaustive component of pseudoscience. To count as pseudoscientific, a belief must also be about some scientific issue, and this is precisely where pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy differ. Just like pseudoscience, pseudophilosophy is defined by a lack of epistemic conscientiousness, but its subject matter is philosophical rather than scientific.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the difference between scientific and philosophical issues is that the latter arenâ€™t in any straightforward way resolvable via empirical investigation. Whether there is a God, for example, or whether there are objective moral truths, are questions that have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all. These questions are thus different from questions such as whether the Earth is flat or spherical, or whether anthrax is caused by bacteria, which do have empirically accessible answers.</p>
<p><strong>There are two kinds of</strong> pseudophilosophy, one mostly harmless and the other insidious. The first variety is usually found in popular scientific contexts. This is where writers, typically with a background in the natural sciences, walk self-confidently into philosophical territory without realising it, and without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. Often implicit empiricist assumptions in epistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language are relied upon as if they were self-evident, and without awareness of the threat that those very assumptions pose to the authorâ€™s own reasoning. We can call this phenomenon scientistic pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>An illustrative example is Sam Harrisâ€™s <a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>The Moral Landscape</em> (2010), in which straw men are lined up due to Harrisâ€™s failure to grasp the content of many of the philosophical claims and arguments that he criticises, such as Humeâ€™s law (or the is/ought problem) and <span>G E Mooreâ€™s</span> open-question argument (ie, that no moral property is identical to a natural property). Similarly, in <em>A Universe from Nothing</em> (2012), Lawrence Krauss engages with philosophical arguments for theism without understanding them properly. Most saliently, he ends up criticising a caricature version of the so-called cosmological argument about the existence of God.</p>
<p>Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity</p>
<p>The insidious kind of pseudophilosophy, which I will focus on here, is an academic enterprise, pursued primarily within the humanities and social sciences. I donâ€™t mean to suggest that the disciplines in question are <em>inherently</em> pseudophilosophical, only that, for some reason, a whole lot of pseudophilosophy goes on within them (although this will vary greatly between different universities and departments). Often philosophical issues are raised concerning knowledge, truth, objectivity, rationality and scientific methodology, and, again, without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. A characteristic trait is a deferential attitude toward some supposedly great continental European thinker or thinkers, such as <span>G W F Hegel,</span> Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre (who might or might not have themselves been guilty of pseudophilosophy). Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity. We can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12047" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> this phenomenon obscurantist pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience is particularly prone to causal fallacies and cherry-picking of data, the most common fallacy in obscurantist pseudophilosophy is equivocation. This fallacy <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0392192112444984" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">exploits</a> ambiguities in certain key terms, where plausible but trivial claims lend apparent credibility to interesting but controversial ones. When challenged, the obscurantist will typically retreat to the safe house provided by the trivial interpretation of his claims, only to reoccupy the controversial ground once the critic has left the scene.</p>
<p>Let me <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.2005.00370.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">illustrate</a> how this works, focusing on <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-foucaults-work-on-power-is-more-important-than-ever" rel="noopener">Michel Foucault</a>, one of the central figures of French postmodernism. A central theme in Foucaultâ€™s writings is a critique of the notion of objective truth. Although there are controversies about interpretation, at least on the face of it Foucault maintains that truth is socially constructed and subject to ideological influence, and therefore not objective. However, his arguments for this claim focus entirely on the way in which what is assumed or believed to be true is influenced by what he refers to as â€˜powerâ€™. It is, of course, a plausible claim that our assumptions or beliefs are susceptible to ideological influence, especially in emotionally charged areas such as politics, but also in supposedly rational areas such as science. But Foucault doesnâ€™t explain how this rather mundane observation is supposed to imply or support the philosophically controversial claim that what is true, or which facts obtain (concerning the shape of the Earth, for example), is susceptible to ideological influence. Instead, by using the word â€˜truthâ€™ in an impressionistic fashion, the distinction between belief and truth is smudged over, allowing Foucault to make seemingly profound statements such as:</p>
<blockquote>[T]ruth isnâ€™t outside power, or lacking in power: contrary to a myth whose history and functions would repay further study, truth isnâ€™t the reward of free spirits, the child of protracted solitude, nor the privilege of those who have succeeded in liberating themselves. Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint.</blockquote>
<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to disambiguate this statement and see what remains.</p>
<p>This kind of fallacious critique of the notion of objective truth is a particularly pernicious aspect of obscurantist pseudophilosophy in general. Often, itâ€™s due to simple misunderstandings (such as confusing truth with belief or knowledge), but sometimes itâ€™s due rather to wilful obscurity (as in the case of Foucault).</p>
<p>Perhaps due to its aura of academic legitimacy and profundity, obscurantist pseudophilosophy is often used to give credence to dogmatic and bellicose political agendas, both on the Left and on the Right. Beyond that, it encourages confused and self-indulgent thinking in university students, and consumes vast resources that could be put to better use.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience can perhaps be counteracted by science education, the cure for pseudophilosophy is not science education but philosophical education. More specifically, it is a matter of developing the kind of basic critical thinking skills that are taught to undergraduates in philosophy. This doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy. Students should be taught things like learning to distinguish in a disciplined way between central philosophical concepts such as belief, truth, rationality and knowledge. They should be aware of the way ambiguities can be exploited by equivocating arguments, and become adept at how to spot other fallacies such as ad hominem and straw man. With these fundamental tools in hand, there would be a good deal less pseudophilosophy going around.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><nav id="sidebar" aria-label="Table of contents"></nav><div id="page-wrapper"><div class="page"><div id="content"><main><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a> does a great job of describing about Python in a few words. So, I'll just copy-paste relevant information here:</p><blockquote><p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p><p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p><p>As of December 2020 Python ranked third in TIOBE’s index of most popular programming languages, behind <code>C</code> and <code>Java</code>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html">docs.python: General Python FAQ</a> for answers to questions like "What is Python?", "What is Python good for?", "Why is it called Python?", etc.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h2><p>On modern Linux distributions, you are likely to find Python already installed. It may be a few versions behind, but should work just fine for most of the topics covered in this book. To get the exact version used here, visit <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python downloads page</a> and install using the appropriate source for your operating system. Should you face any issues in installing, search online for a solution. Yes, that is something I expect you should be able to do as a prerequisite for this book, i.e. you should have prior experience with basic programming and computer usage.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html">docs.python: What's New</a> to track changes across versions. As mentioned in the Preface chapter, <strong>3.9.0</strong> is the version used in this book.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#online-tools" id="online-tools">Online tools</a></h2><p>In case you are facing installation issues, or do not want to (or cannot) install Python on your computer for some reason, there are plenty of options to execute Python programs using online tools. Some of the popular ones are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">Repl.it</a> — Interactive playground. Code, collaborate, compile, run, share, and deploy Python and more online from your browser</li><li><a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">Pythontutor</a> — Visualize code execution, also has example codes and ability to share sessions</li><li><a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> — Host, run, and code Python in the cloud</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/">offical Python website</a> also has a <em>Launch Interactive Shell</em> option (<a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">https://www.python.org/shell/</a>), which gives access to a REPL session.</p><h2><a href="#first-program" id="first-program">First program</a></h2><p>It is customary to start learning a new programming language by printing a simple phrase. Create a new directory, say <code>Python/programs</code> for this book. Then, create a plain text file named <code>hello.py</code> with your favorite text editor and type the following piece of code.</p><pre><code># hello.py
print('*************')
print('Hello there!')
print('*************')
</code></pre><p>If you are familiar with using command line on a Unix-like system, run the script as shown below. Other options to execute a Python program will be discussed in the next section.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9 hello.py
*************
Hello there!
*************
</code></pre><p>A few things to note here. The first line is a comment, used here to indicate the name of the Python program. <code>print()</code> is a built-in function, which can be used without having to load some library. A single string argument has been used for each of the three invocations. <code>print()</code> automatically appends a newline character by default. The program ran without a compilation step. As quoted earlier, Python is an <em>interpreted</em> language. More details will be discussed in later chapters.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> All the Python programs discussed in this book, along with related text files, can be accessed from my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/100_page_python_intro/tree/main/programs">learnbyexample: 100_page_python_intro</a>. However, I highly recommend typing the programs manually by yourself.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#ide-and-text-editors" id="ide-and-text-editors">IDE and text editors</a></h2><p>An <strong>integrated development environment</strong> (IDE) might suit you better if you are not comfortable with the command line. IDE provides features likes debugging, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, code refactoring and so on. They also help in setting up <strong>virtual environment</strong> to manage different versions of Python and modules (more on that later).</p><p>If you install Python on Windows, it will automatically include <strong>IDLE</strong>, an IDE built using Python's <code>tkinter</code> module. On Linux, see if you already have the program <code>idle3.9</code>. Otherwise you may have to install it separately, for example, <code>sudo apt install idle-python3.9</code> on Ubuntu.</p><p>When you open IDLE, you'll get a Python shell (discussed in the next section). For now, click the <strong>New File</strong> option under <strong>File</strong> menu to open a text editor. Type the short program <code>hello.py</code> discussed in the previous section. After saving the code, press <strong>F5</strong> to run it. You'll see the results in the shell window.</p><p>Screenshots from the text editor and the Python shell are shown below.</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/hello.png" alt="hello.py program on IDLE editor"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/Python_shell_run.png" alt="Python shell example with output from an executed program"></p><p>Popular alternatives to IDLE are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> — Python IDE for beginners, lots of handy features like viewing variables, debugger, step through, highlight syntax errors, name completion, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> — smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting and quick-fixes, automated code refactorings, rich navigation capabilities, support for frameworks, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a> — typically used for scientific computing</li><li><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> — web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text</li><li><a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> — community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of VSCode</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">Vim</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a> — text editors with support for syntax highlighting and more</li></ul><h2><a href="#repl" id="repl">REPL</a></h2><p>One of the best features of Python is the interactive shell. Such shells are also referred to as REPL, which is an abbreviation for <strong>R</strong>ead <strong>E</strong>valuate <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>L</strong>oop. The Python REPL makes it easy for beginners to try out code snippets for learning purposes. Beyond learning, it is also useful for developing a program in small steps, debugging a large program by trying out few lines of code at a time and so on. REPL will be used frequently in this book to show code snippets.</p><p>When you launch Python from the command line, or open IDLE, you get a shell that is ready for user input after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9
Python 3.9.0 (default, Dec  2 2020, 10:42:13) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre><p>Try the below instructions. The first one displays a greeting using the <code>print()</code> function. Then, a user defined variable is used to store a string value. To display the value, you can either use <code>print()</code> again or just type the variable name. Expression results are immediately displayed in the shell. Name of a variable by itself is a valid expression. This behavior is unique to the REPL and an expression by itself won't display anything when used inside a script.</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('have a nice day')
have a nice day

&gt;&gt;&gt; username = 'learnbyexample'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(username)
learnbyexample

# use # to start a single line comment
# note that string representation is shown instead of actual value
# details will be discussed later
&gt;&gt;&gt; username
'learnbyexample'

# use exit() to close the shell, can also use Ctrl+D shortcut
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()
</code></pre><p>I'll stress again the importance of following along the code snippets by manually typing them on your computer. Programming requires hands-on experience too, reading alone isn't enough. As an analogy, can you learn to drive a car by just reading about it? Since one of the prerequisite is that you should already be familiar with programming basics, I'll extend the analogy to learning to drive a different car model. Or, perhaps a different vehicle such as a truck or a bus might be more appropriate here.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Depending on the command line shell you are using, you might have the <code>readline</code> library that makes it easier to use the REPL. For example, <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> arrow keys to browse code history, re-execute them (after editing if necessary), search history, autocomplete based on first few characters and so on. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline">wikipedia: GNU readline</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/readline">wiki.archlinux: readline</a> for more information.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> You can use <code>python3.9 -q</code> to avoid <em>version and copyright messages</em> when you start an interactive shell. Use <code>python3.9 -h</code> or visit <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html">docs.python: Command line and environment</a> for documentation on cli options.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#documentation-and-getting-help" id="documentation-and-getting-help">Documentation and getting help</a></h2><p>The offical Python website has an extensive documentation located at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">https://docs.python.org/3/</a>. This includes a tutorial, which is much more comprehensive than the contents presented in this book, several guides for specific modules like <code>re</code> and <code>argparse</code> and various other information.</p><p>Here's a couple of annotated screenshots:</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_1.png" alt="Python documentation: part 1"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_2.png" alt="Python documentation: part 2"></p><p>Python provides a <code>help()</code> function, which is quite handy to use from the REPL.

What would we find if we opened the safe of this tiny State located in the heart of the European Union, listed by many researchers in the world’s top&nbsp;5 tax havens&nbsp;? The OpenLux investigation, conducted by <em>Le Monde</em> along with ten media partners for more than a year, provides answers&nbsp;: 55,000&nbsp;offshore companies managing assets worth at least 6&nbsp;trillion euros.</p>          <p>These phantom companies without offices or employees were created by billionaires, multinationals, sportsmen, artists, high-ranking politicians and even royal families. Luxembourg acts as a magnet for the wealth of the world&nbsp;: in a territory of 2,586&nbsp;km2, Tiger Woods and Cristiano Ronaldo rub shoulders with Shakira and the King of Bahrain. Hundreds of multinationals (LVMH, Kering, Altice, Pfizer, Amazon…) have opened financial subsidiaries. Wealthy families increase their real estate assets there.</p>            <p>More surprisingly, OpenLux reveals that questionable funds, suspected of originating in criminal activity or linked to criminals targeted by judicial investigations, have been concealed in Luxembourg. This is the case of companies linked to the Italian Mafia, the’Ndrangheta, and the Russian underworld. The League, Italy’s far-right party, has hidden a secret fund which is sought by the Italian authorities. People close to the Venezuelan regime have recycled corrupt government procurement funds.</p>          <p>To conduct this investigation, <em>Le Monde </em>has compiled a huge database that lists the beneficiaries of the 124.000&nbsp;commercial companies registered in Luxembourg, i.e. their true owners, along with 3.3&nbsp;million administrative acts and financial reports. These are documents that have recently been made public, but are only available on the Luxembourg trade register website. <em>Le Monde </em>was able to extract them in their entirety for analysis, in partnership with the <em>Suddeutsche</em> <em>Zeitung </em>in Germany, <em>Le Soir</em> in Belgium, McClatchy in the United States, Woxx in Luxembourg, <em>IrpiMedia</em> in Italy, and the OCCRP Consortium of investigative journalists.</p>          <h2>157 nationalities represented</h2>          <p>These investigations confirm that the Grand Duchy is, contrary to what the Luxembourg authorities claim, a veritable offshore centre, halfway between the City of London and the British Virgin Islands. Nearly 90&nbsp;% of its <em>«&nbsp;companies&nbsp;»</em> are controlled by non-Luxembourgers. Among the 157&nbsp;nationalities represented in this amazing <em>«&nbsp;Who’s who&nbsp;»</em>, the French stand out&nbsp;: they head the list with, in total, more than 17.000 companies<strong>.</strong></p>            <p>What they house is surprising&nbsp;: valuable property, here a castle near Paris owned by a Saudi prince, there a vineyard in Provence owned by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and an endless list of villas on the French Riviera and well-appointed Parisian apartments. But also flagships of the French economy, such as Yves Rocher, Chanel, JCDecaux and Decathlon. It’s almost as if Luxembourg owned small pieces of France.</p>                     <p>The case of France is not isolated&nbsp;: it is also through Luxembourg companies that some investment funds buy whole swathes of cities such as Berlin and London, causing real estate prices to rocket without being identifiable or paying taxes. The list of international assets held in Luxembourg is a gigantic inventory, including luxurious residences, chalets, yachts, helicopters, private jets and big planes, music catalogues, the rights to images, works of art, in short, the list is endless.</p>          <p>In total, as confirmed by the list of 64,458&nbsp;beneficiaries identified by OpenLux&nbsp;: the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg concentrates a large part of the world’s wealth. It is home to at least 279 of the more than 2,000&nbsp;billionaires listed by <em>Forbes</em> magazine. But also 37 of the 50&nbsp;wealthiest French families, such as the Mulliez, Guerrand-Hermès and Bernard Arnault, who structure their group, their assets and their investments through dozens of Luxembourg holding companies.</p>          <h2>A prime location for tax planning</h2>          <p>There are various reasons for choosing Luxembourg&nbsp;: a central position in the European Union, high-quality financial engineering, financial regulations tailored to business, direct access to the country’s institutions, and political stability. But let there be no mistake&nbsp;: the first reasons are taxation and discretion. They are the result of political choices dating back to the time of former Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker (1995-2013), who later became President of the European Commission.</p>            <p>Luxembourg has certainly turned its back on its former tax rescripts, these ultra- advantageous arrangements granted to large multinationals, following the revelations on the subject in 2014 by the <em>«&nbsp;LuxLeaks&nbsp;»</em> investigation. But it remains a hotbed of tax planning for companies and wealthy individuals through preferential tax regimes. This encourages, in some cases, abuse and, possibly, fraud.</p>          <p>The scale of the financial centre is such that the Grand Duchy seems, moreover, insufficiently equipped to guarantee effective control over all the flows it handles. Its services seem to be more calibrated to the size of the country than to its offshore activity. The trade register has only 59&nbsp;employees to enforce the legal obligation to declare the actual beneficiaries of more than 100.000&nbsp;entities and to carry out an initial control of the declarations. The Financial Sector Supervisory Commission (CSSF) has only 900 employees, even though the financial sector accounts for a quarter of the country’s economy.</p>          <p>Of course, Luxembourg is not the only country to have entered the race for the lowest tax bill. But this is the first time that an investigation has exhaustively documented the phenomenon, through the analysis of the microeconomic fabric of a State.</p>          <blockquote> <p>The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem</p> </blockquote>         <p>This truth operation would not have been possible without a directive voted by the European Union in 2018, which required the creation of public registers of the real owners of companies in all member states. This historic reform came after a decade of financial scandals, culminating in the <em>«&nbsp;Panama papers&nbsp;»</em> in 2016, that revealed the extent of the role played by opaque companies and offshore arrangements in laundering criminal activities, including tax fraud. A decade in which at the same time anti-corruption judges and tax authorities saw their investigations coming up against front companies and front men.</p>            <p>Luxembourg was one of the first to apply the European directive, making its register public in autumn 2019. In a way, it is therefore paying the price of transparency. The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem by guaranteeing the reliability of these registers. For example, almost half of the companies, funds and foundations registered in Luxembourg have no real identifiable beneficiaries to date. However, as the European directive states, <em>«&nbsp;public access to information on the actual recipients allows greater control of information by civil society (…) and helps to preserve confidence in the integrity of commercial transactions and the financial system&nbsp;»</em>.</p>                                 </section>    </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f2fc11fb4d616c1f00b5"><div><p>Whenever someone asks which <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs#database" target="_blank">Node.js ORM</a> they should use, one of the first answers is always some version of “<em>don’t use an ORM, just write SQL</em>”. This answer is then usually attacked with an opposite opinion along the lines of “<em>you need to use an ORM to hide all that nasty SQL</em>”. People always seem to ignore the third option: using <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">an ORM that embraces SQL</a>!</p><p>I completely understand where the hatred comes from though. There are real problems in many ORMs, that <a href="https://medium.com/u/ac187d616e0b" target="_blank">Thomas Hunter II</a> summarizes well in his post <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/why-you-should-avoid-orms-with-examples-in-node-js-e0baab73fa5" target="_blank">Why you should avoid ORMs</a>. The main points Thomas listed were</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You learn the ORM, not SQL and that knowledge is usually not transferable to other tools.</p></li><li><p>Complex ORM calls are inefficient. ORMs have their own object-oriented query language which they try to convert to SQL, and it’s usually really difficult.</p></li><li><p>ORMs can’t do everything. The object oriented approach of most ORMs doesn’t map well to SQL. For many SQL operations, there is no object oriented equivalent.</p></li></ol><p>These problems arise from the fact that most ORMs are designed to abstract away SQL in favor of some object oriented interface. But not all ORMs are like that!</p><p>I created an ORM called <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">objection.js</a> for exactly the reasons Thomas listed. The design goal of objection.js is to allow you to use SQL whenever possible and only provide a DSL (Domain Specific Language) or a custom concept when something cannot be easily done using SQL. I’ll get back to objection.js soon. First, I’ll introduce you to the most common argument for avoiding ORMs:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easier to write &lt;something&gt; in plain SQL than using an ORM</p></blockquote><p>This argument is usually followed by a contrived example like this:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_4953"><p>Yes, if you only need a flat list of items from one table at a time, by all means, don’t use an ORM! Of course you can use joins, subqueries and multiple queries to access related items in other tables, but that easily becomes tedious. For example, here’s a very basic query that joins a many-to-many relationship (children of a person) and a has-many relationship (pets of a person)</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_6074"><div><p>That’s already quite a bit of SQL. What if you want to join more relationships? How about nested relationships? You also need to repeat that every time you want to fetch the related objects. Not to mention the result of that query is a flat list of items and not a nested tree of objects.</p><p>The next thing any ORM hater would do is to use a library that converts that flat result list into a nicely nested object tree and then proceed to writing a bunch of helper functions for adding those joins to queries so that you don’t need to repeat yourself. You quickly realize that most of these helper functions look the same and only the table names and foreign keys are different. Then the obvious choice is to go ahead and define the relationships in a single place as objects and create a generic function that takes a relationship description object and outputs the needed joins.</p><p>Congratulations, you’ve just reinvented the ORM!</p><p>In my opinion, that’s all a good ORM is: a set of tools to make using SQL easier! It allows you to fully use all the features of SQL and the underlying database engine and only provides helpers and custom solutions to things that are difficult to achieve with just plain SQL.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_8837"><div><p>With objection.js, you always work with a<a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/#class-querybuilder" target="_blank"> query builder</a>. You can build any query and use as much SQL as you want but it also helps you to deal with the repetitive stuff like relations if you want it to. The <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/join-methods.html#joinrelation" target="_blank">leftJoinRelation</a> method is given the names of the relations you want to join and objection.js uses the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/relations.html#examples" target="_blank">relation mappings</a> to create the joins. </p><p>Now you may be thinking, “that’s not much shorter and I still need to define the relationships somewhere”. Well yeah, but you only need to do that once. If your project is so simple that defining the relationships and models takes a significant part of your development time, it doesn’t matter whether you use an ORM or not.</p><p>The <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/join-methods.html#joinrelation" target="_blank">joinRelation</a> query above is 100% equivalent to the previous SQL query and would still produce a flat list of result rows. You can easily get a tree of objects using the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading" target="_blank">joinEager</a> method:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_9918"><p>Loading nested relations is just as easy:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554871633687_10767"><p>And in the next code block is the minimal SQL needed to carry out that query. The selects with aliases are needed to be able to build the object tree from the flat list.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555046254723_11559"><p>For many ORMs, SQL concepts like subqueries are difficult or impossible to write. Since all objection.js operations return a <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/" target="_blank">query builder</a>, writing <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/recipes/subqueries.html" target="_blank">subqueries</a> is just as easy as using plain SQL. For example, fetching all people that have at least one pet called ‘Fluffy’</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_14131"><p>But there’s also an easier way to write this in objection.js if you have defined the <code>pets</code> relationship for the <code>Person</code> model:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_15231"><div><p>But that requires you to learn the ORM (which was one of the arguments against ORMs). You can still start by writing the SQL solution you are familiar with. Once you learn more about objection.js, you find helpers like this that improve your productivity.</p><p>Here’s another example of using the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/model/static-methods.html#static-relatedquery" target="_blank">relatedQuery</a> helper</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554876097081_10902"><div><p>If your application is simple and you rarely need to deal with nested data and relations, using plain SQL or a query builder like <a href="https://knexjs.org/" target="_blank">knex</a> can be a good option. However, in most applications you want to work with nested data and a lot of relations and an ORM can be a helpful tool. With objection.js, you don’t need to make a compromise. You get the flexibility of a query builder and the relational power of an ORM in the same package.</p><p>If you found any of this interesting, take a closer look at <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">objection.js.</a></p><p>Some links to get you started</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/installation.html" target="_blank">Getting started</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading" target="_blank">Eager loading</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#graph-inserts" target="_blank">Graph inserts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/1069" target="_blank">Who is using objection</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html" target="_blank">Query examples</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/recipes/relation-subqueries.html" target="_blank">Relation subqueries</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

February 9, 2021 | https://thibault.uk/posts/why-give-id-card/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thibault.uk/posts/why-give-id-card/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Youtube asked me to verify my age. To do so, I got asked to either enter a credit card in my name, or to upload my ID card.</p><p><img src="https://thibault.uk/images/why-give-id-card-01.png" alt="Youtube age verification"></p><p>And that’s a no. I won’t. Why should I?</p><p>Digging more into this, I find out that Youtube posted <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/using-technology-more-consistently-apply-age-restrictions/">a blog</a> on September 22, 2020, annoucing the new changes to their policy. In this blog post, titled <em>Using technology to more consistently apply age restrictions</em>, Youtube team goes over the forthcoming European Union’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/revision-audiovisual-media-services-directive-avmsd">Audiovisual Media Services Directive</a>, and how, under this directive, they have to make sure their user is over 18 to access restricted content.</p><p>Fair enough. Let’s check <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018L1808&amp;from=EN#d1e1323-69-1">this directive</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Article 6a</p><p>Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that audiovisual media services provided by media service providers under their jurisdiction which may impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors are only made available in such a way as to ensure that minors will not normally hear or see them. Such measures may include selecting the time of the broadcast, age verification tools or other technical measures. They shall be proportionate to the potential harm of the programme.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, the directive mentions age verification tools. This is used as an example, and clearly balanced based on the content. Like, I may be young, but I know there is porn on TV. In short, this age verification is not something Youtube has to do, it’s something they decided to implement.</p><p>They could have leveraged:</p><ul><li>the age of the account, mine is 14 years old, and I did not open it at age 4</li><li>the kind of videos/channels I’m subscribe to</li><li>or ask me to come at a later time, if the content is too sensitive</li></ul><p>This is not a legal advice. I’m not a lawyer. Nevertheless, I’m sure there were better way to handle this.</p><h2 id="everyone-does-it">Everyone does it
<a href="#everyone-does-it"></a></h2><p>The ask from Youtube feels an extension of showing a card to buy alcohol or to enter a club. It is a weird moment between you and what you are looking for, protected by a bored guardian.</p><p>And to their defence, they are not the only one asking for my ID card. In fact, most services I use are moving to this type of check. This is labelled as Know Your Customer (KYC) policies.</p><p>For what I recall, the first service asking me to upload my identity card was my bank. Then came an airline company. Then a company mandated by an estate agent. Now Youtube.</p><p>Is this really necessary? I put money on my bank account monthly, I fly regularly with my airline company, and I have a deposit with my estate agent. Youtube probably has more data than all of these companies combined, and is still asking for some verification.</p><p>The thing that depresses me the most is when they all come at the end of the year with shiny web interfaces telling me how great the year with me was. The bank telling me I spent hundreds in groceries, the airline that it’s missing me, the estate agent that my rented flat is the best they’ve ever seen. And Youtube celebrating creators I don’t follow. So clearly, they have data, they know me. Nevertheless, they still ask me.</p><h2 id="the-cost-to-user">The cost to user
<a href="#the-cost-to-user"></a></h2><p>I should not feel concern but I am. We are in 2021. It is easier than ever to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7370015B2/en">impersonate a website</a>. Most users do <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858214">not know basic security principles</a>. I probably don’t either.</p><p>And with all this in mind, most companies require users to upload sensitive information via web forms. Companies that do not have an actual need for it! Youtube does not, my estate agent does not, my airline company falls into a category I wish would not. And my bank, well, is my bank.</p><p>The KYC system is worse than it looks. Once one of the company you have KYC-ed with falls victim of a breach, your online identity is compromised everywhere. With a manual verification, the attacker can now impersonate you in most of your accounts. ID cards don’t lie.</p><p>A remedial to this issue came when companies started asking for a unique passcode (usually 6 digits) to be written down when uploading the picture of your ID card. I am still unsure how this helps. Sure, it delays the scammers that got ID before, but we are in 2021; Adobe Photoshop is more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">30 years old</a>. Moreover, computer generated pictures start to look good, very good.</p><p><img src="https://thibault.uk/images/why-give-id-card-02.png" alt="Picture of generated.photos"></p><p>In the end, users pay the cost. They are the ones which credentials get compromised. It is their identity that is placed at risk. Their life being uploaded online. I trust companies saying they are complying with the law. I trust Youtube telling me they have to check my age. I simply think that these checks do not fulfil their goals and place an immense burden on users.</p><h2 id="a-better-path">A better path
<a href="#a-better-path"></a></h2><p>This post could have ended here. Me ranting that things were better before, pointing out issues in the way data is being handle by tech companies. However, the picture would not be complete. I think there are ways to make this better.</p><p>First, no company should ask me for documents defining my identity. These are <em>very</em> sensitive data and I don’t trust any company with them. No matter how secure they are, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches">will have a breach</a>. This is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lsi.12303">trickier</a> for services that have actual legal requirements to do so, such as my bank.</p><p>Second, if your password system does not offer Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), do not bother ask for secure documents. Asking for specific letters in a second password does not count as MFA. If you are expecting me to trust you are doing everything possible to store my documents securely, apply standard security practices. I don’t care about “but our telephone support needs to know the 3rd character of your password”. This is a no!</p><p>Thirdly, look at cryptography. Recent research in Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Zero Knowledge Proof made secure assessment on the client side feasible. I imagine a company valued over a trillion dollar, and with some of the best researchers on the planet, has resources to unearth privacy preserving age verification tools.</p><p>Finally, companies should be more transparent on their policy enforcement. Internet has become a central place of exchange for a lot of people online. New policies have a huge impact on users, and their daily life. I applaud the effort of the Youtube team to share a blog about their policy change, but I can only deplore the absence of user quotes. An additional requirement places content <a href="https://twitter.com/yopalmm/status/1344806043881189383?s=20">one step away from the user</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

quarter circle will be roughly proportional to the area. More specifically, the fraction of all the grid points inside

<p>The great ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes figured out the circle area over two thousand years ago without
integral calculus (or trigonometric functions for that matter). He started with an elegant insight about regular (i.e.,
equal-sided) polygons.</p>
<p>The famous <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI37.html">“half base times height”
formula for the area of a triangle already had a well-known proof in the first book of Euclid’s Elements of
Geometry</a> (easily derived from <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI35.html">a
theorem about parallelograms</a>). Conveniently, any regular polygon can be split into equal triangles joined to the
centre. For example, a regular hexagon splits into six triangles, as in the figure below. We can take any one of the
triangles (they’re all the same) and call the “base” the side that’s also a side of the polygon. Then the “height” is
the line from the centre of the base to the centre of the polygon.</p>

<p>Now here’s Archimedes’s neat insight: The ratio of the triangle area to the base is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">

<p>Of course, Archimedes was a respected mathematician who couldn’t get away with just assuming that anything true of a
polygon is true of a circle (counterexample: all polygons have bumpy corners, but circles don’t). He used the kind of
geometric proof by contradiction that was popular in his day. (He even took it further and analysed spheres, cylinders,
parabolas and other curved objects, almost inventing something like modern real analysis a couple of millenia early.)
Sadly, not all of his mathemetical work has survived, but <a href="https://flashman.neocities.org/ARCHCI1set.htm">the
key part of his Measurement of a Circle</a> has.</p>
<p>Here’s the high-level version. Archimedes claimed that the area of a circle is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><a href="https://cppinsights.io/">C++ Insights</a> is a <a target="_blank" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>-based tool which does a source to source transformation. Its goal is to make things visible, which normally and intentionally happen behind the scenes. It's about the magic the compiler does for us to make things work. Or looking through the classes of a compiler.</p> <p>Some time ago, I started looking into some new things we got with C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20. Amazing things like lambdas, range-based for-loops, and structured bindings. I put it together in a talk. You can find the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.andreasfertig.info/talks_dl/afertig-ndcolo-2017-fast-and-small.pdf">slides</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Bt7KzFxcbgc">video</a> online.</p> <p>However, all that research and some of my training and teaching got me to start thinking about how it would be if we could see with the eyes of the compiler. Sure, there is an AST-dump, at least for clang. With tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/#">Compiler Explorer</a>, we can see what code the compiler generates from a C++ source snippet. However, what we see is assembler. Neither the AST nor the <a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/#">Compiler Explorer</a> output is in the language I write code, and therefore I'm most familiar with. Plus, when teaching students C++ showing an AST and explaining that it is all there was not quite satisfying for me.</p> <p>I started to write a <a target="_blank" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>-based tool able to transform a range-based for-loop into the compiler-internal version. Then, I did the same for structured bindings and lambdas. In the end, I ended up doing a lot more as initially planned. It shows where operators are invoked, places in which the compiler does some casting. <a href="https://cppinsights.io/">C++ Insights</a> is able to deduce the type behind <code>auto</code> or <code>decltype</code>. The goal is to produce compilable code. However, this is not possible in all places.</p> <p>Still, there is work to do.</p> <p>I do not claim to get all the things right. This is just the initial version of <a href="https://cppinsights.io/">C++ Insights</a> I consider good enough to hand it to the public. Also, keep in mind that it is solely based on clang and my understanding of C++ and the AST.</p> <p>You can see, for example, the transformation of a <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/f7710a4b">lambda</a>, <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/40f6a267">range-based for-loop</a>, or <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/e1a8cf40">auto</a>. Of course, you can transform any other C++ snippet.</p> <p>For those who like videos, there is a C++ Insights series on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhIubRbFfuM&amp;list=PLm0Dc2Lp2ycaFyR2OqPkusuSB8LmifY8D" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. If you have topics you like me to speak about, please reach out to me.</p> <p>The version information of the C++ Insights version running on this website can be found here: <a href="https://cppinsights.io/version">https://cppinsights.io/version</a>.</p> <p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/andreasfertig/cppinsights-web">source</a> of the web front-end and the tool <a href="https://github.com/andreasfertig/cppinsights">C++ Insights</a> on Github.</p> <p>If you like to support the project, consider <a href="https://github.com/andreasfertig/cppinsights/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">submitting</a> a patch.

Lieberman caused an international stir nearly a decade ago when he published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08723">paper</a> showing that running in cushioned sneakers encourages people to hit the ground harder than running barefoot.</p><p data-reactroot="">Lieberman, a professor of biological sciences at Harvard University, also started running barefoot himself as an experiment and kept doing it because he enjoyed it. Every spring, after running the Boston Marathon, he would trade his traditional sneakers for a pair of minimal shoes or no footwear at all. The more he ran barefoot, the more callused and protected his feet became. “But I could still feel the ground just as well as when my calluses were really thin,” Lieberman says. From an evolutionary standpoint, it made sense that callused feet would still feel: they are the body’s only contact with the ground, and ancient people could not afford to lose that sensation, he thought.</p><p data-reactroot="">Now Lieberman and his colleagues at Harvard and in Germany and Kenya have conducted another study, published Wednesday in <i><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1345-6">Nature</a></i>, that confirms his suspicions. It finds that although calluses thicken as people walk barefoot more often, there is no trade-off in sensation from that extra protection. Essentially, the hard surface of the callus transmits mechanical force through the foot to the nerves deep inside the skin equally well as an unprotected sole.</p><p data-reactroot="">Calluses are made out of the protein keratin, the same material as fingernails, glued together with another special protein. “There’s no viscosity to calluses, so forces from the ground go right into deeper layers of skin, and you don’t lose any information,” Lieberman says.</p><p data-reactroot="">Lieberman and his colleagues measured the sensitivity of the sole to mechanical stimuli, showing that people with thick calluses were as sensitive to vibrations as those with thin or no calluses. The researchers compared calluses and foot sensitivity among 81 people from western Kenya, some of whom regularly went without footwear and some of whom did not. They also collected similar data from 22 people in Boston.</p><p data-reactroot="">With cushioned shoes, the stiffness of the sole slows the rate at which the body hits the ground, making the impact more comfortable, but the force is the same, Lieberman says. “The energy that gets shot up your leg is about three times bigger in a cushioned shoe than if you’re barefoot,” he says, adding that “we have no idea what that means” for joint health. It is theoretically possible, he says, that this extra impact is behind the doubling of rates of arthritis of the knee since World War II—about the time that technological advances in footwear design allowed for more cushioned soles. But there is no solid evidence to support such a connection.</p><p data-reactroot="">In some ways, walking barefoot is better for the body than wearing deeply cushioned soles, Lieberman says. But he insists he is not antifootwear: “I’m not saying people shouldn’t wear shoes.” Rather he thinks that scientists do not yet understand the impact of footwear on the body over the course of millions of steps. Lieberman says it would be challenging to study the effects of wearing shoes for millions upon millions of steps over the course of 70-plus years in humans, but he is currently exploring the impact of such cushioning on animal locomotion.</p><p data-reactroot="">Balance might also be a casualty of soft soles. People’s feet become less sensitive as they age. If they have also lost touch with the ground, they might become more vulnerable to falls, Lieberman explains. “If your feet can’t sense what’s going on on the ground, maybe you’re more susceptible and more vulnerable [to falls], and shoes may be a part of that,” he says. “If we can give people’s brains, their reflexes, more information, that might help them.”</p><p data-reactroot="">Gymnasts and martial artists go barefoot to increase their connection with the ground, and Formula One race car drivers wear hard-soled shoes that actually boost their sensitivity, according to one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19277695">study</a>.</p><p data-reactroot="">With today’s cushioned shoes, “we add comfort, but we reduce functionality,” says Thorsten Sterzing, a footwear scientist who designs high-performance shoes. He was not involved in the new research but hopes to build on it in his own work. Too often, people opt for footwear that fits society’s idea of beauty, yet that does not promote healthy walking, he says. Studies like Lieberman’s can lead to better-designed shoes that complement the body’s natural abilities rather than undermine them.</p><p data-reactroot="">Kristiaan D’Août, a senior lecturer in musculoskeletal biology at the University of Liverpool in England, says the foot is one of the least understood structures in the body because of individual variation, the complexity of foot bones and ligaments, and because so much of what happens inside the foot is impossible to see. D’Août was not involved in the recent paper, but he conducts related work and wrote a commentary about the study that appears in the same issue of <i>Nature</i>. In one of his research studies, D’Août had participants wear minimal shoes for six months. Although they were uncomfortable at first, “quite a few people prefer them now,” he says. “One of the things that I would really hope would come out of this research and footwear research in general is that people will start to realize that shoes can be quite invasive.” (D’Août admits he usually wears regular shoes himself because of the wet, gloomy weather in Liverpool.)</p><p data-reactroot="">People have probably been wearing shoes for about 40,000 years, Lieberman says, although some suspect that Neandertals remained shoeless. In some parts of the world, including India and Kenya, where Lieberman conducts research, many people still go their whole lives without wearing shoes. “I find it unimaginable to be barefoot in middle of Europe in the Ice Age, but then again, all the other animals in Europe during the Ice Age were barefoot—so maybe our cousins, the Neandertals, were able to handle it just fine,” Lieberman says.</p><p data-reactroot="">Still, he says, he has no plans to test going barefoot himself during a New England winter.</p><p data-reactroot=""><i>Karen Weintraub is a freelance health and science journalist who writes regularly for the </i>New York Times<i>, </i>STAT<i> and </i>USA Today<i>, among others.</i></p></section></div></div></article></div></article></div>]]>

<p>And it looks pretty hard.</p>


<p>In his classic paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.8330&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">How to Build a Highly Available System Using Consensus</a> Butler Lampson laid out a pattern that's become very popular in the design of large-scale highly-available systems. Consensus is used to deal with unusual situations like host failures (Lampson says <em>reserved for emergencies</em>), and leases (time-limited locks) provide efficient normal operation. The paper lays out a roadmap for implementing systems of this kind, leaving just the implementation details to the reader.</p>

<p>The core algorithm behind this paper, Paxos, is famous for its complexity and subtlety. Lampson, like many who came after him<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, try to build a framework of specific implementation details around it to make it more approachable. It's effective, but incomplete. The challenge is that Paxos's subtlety is only one of the hard parts of building a consensus system. There are three categories of challenges that I see people completely overlook.</p>

<p><strong>Determinism</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>"How  can  we  arrange  for  each  replica  to  do  the  same  thing?  Adopting  a  scheme  first proposed  by  Lamport,  we  build  each  replica  as  a  deterministic  state  machine;  this means that the transition relation is a function from (state, input) to (new state, output). It is customary to call one of these replicas a ‘process’. Several processes that start in the same state and see the same sequence of inputs will do the same thing, that is, end up in the same state and produce the same outputs" - Butler Lampson (from <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.8330&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">How to Build a Highly Available System Using Consensus</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Conceptually, that's really easy. We start with a couple of replicas with <em>state</em>, feed them <em>input</em>, and they all end up with <em>new state</em>. Same inputs in, same state out. Realistically, it's hard. Here are just some of the challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Concurrency</em>. Typical runtimes and operating systems use more than just your program's state to schedule threads, which means that code that uses multiple threads, multiple processes, remote calls, or even just IO, can end up with non-deterministic results. The simple fix is to be resolutely single-threaded, but that has severe performance implications<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li><em>Floating Point</em>. Trivial floating-point calculations are deterministic. Complex floating point calculations, especially where different replicas run on different CPUs, have code built with different compilers, may not be<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>. In <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20-paper-brooker.pdf">Physalia</a> we didn't support floating point, because this was too hard to think about.</li>
<li><em>Bug fixes</em>. Say the code that turns <em>state</em> and <em>input</em> into <em>new state</em> has a bug. How do you fix it? You can't just change it and then roll it out incrementally to different replicas. You don't want to deploy all your replicas at once (we're trying to build an HA system, remember?) So you need to come up with a migration strategy. Maybe a flag sequence number. Or complex migration code that changes <em>buggy new state</em> into <em>good new state</em>. Possible, but hard.</li>
<li><em>Code updates</em>. Are you sure that version <em>N+1</em> produces exactly the same output as version <em>N</em> for all inputs? You shouldn't be, because even in the well-specified world of cryptography <a href="https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am">that's not always true</a>.</li>
<li><em>Corruption</em>. In reality, <em>input</em> isn't just <em>input</em>, it's also a constant stream of failing components, thermal noise, cosmic rays, and other similar assaults on the castle of determinism. Can you survive them all?</li>
</ul>


<p>And more. There's always more.</p>

<p>Some people will tell you that you can solve these problems by using <em>byzantine</em> consensus protocols. Those people are right, of course. They're also the kind of people who solved their rodent problem by keeping a leopard in their house. Other people will tell you that you can solve these problems with blockchain. Those people are best ignored.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring and Control</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Although using a single, centralized, server is the simplest way to implement a service, the resulting service can only be as fault tolerant as the processor executing that server. If this level of fault tolerance is unacceptable, then multiple servers that fail independently must be used. - Fred Schneider (from <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/SMSurvey.pdf">Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using the State Machine Approach: A Tutorial</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole point of building a highly-available distributed system is to exceed the availability of a single system. If you can't do that, you've added a bunch of complexity for nothing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Complex systems run in degraded mode. - Richard Cook (from <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">How Complex Systems Fail</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Depending on what you mean by <em>failed</em>, distributed systems of <em>f+1</em>, <em>2f+1</em> or <em>3f+1</em> nodes can entirely hide the failure of <em>f</em> nodes from their clients. This, combined with a process of repairing failed nodes, allows us to build highly-available systems even in the face of significant failure rates. It also leads directly to one of the traps of building a distributed system: clients can't tell the difference between the case where an outage is <em>f</em> failures away, and where it's just one failure away. If a system can tolerate <em>f</em> failures, then <em>f-1</em> failures may look completely healthy.</p>

<p>Consensus systems cannot be monitored entirely <em>from the outside</em> (see <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2016/01/03/correlation.html">why must systems be operated?</a>). Instead, monitoring needs to be deeply aware of the implementation details of the system, so it can know when nodes are healthy, and can be replaced. If they choose the wrong nodes to replace, disaster will strike.</p>

<blockquote><p>Control planes provide much of the power of the cloud, but their privileged position also means that they have to act safely, responsibly, and carefully to avoid introducing additional failures. - Brooker, Chen, and Ping (from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20-paper-brooker.pdf">Millions of Tiny Databases</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Do You Really Need Strong Consistency?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>It is possible to provide high availability and partition tolerance, if atomic consistency is not required. - Gilbert and Lynch</p></blockquote>

<p>The typical state-machine implementation of consensus provides a strong consistency property called <em>linearizability</em>. In exchange, it can't be available for all clients during a network partition. That's probably why you chose it.</p>

<p>Is that why you chose it? Do you need <em>linearizability</em>? Or would something else, like <em>causality</em> be enough? Using consensus when its properties aren't really needed is a mistake a lot of folks seem to make. Service discovery, configuration distribution, and similar problems can all be handled adequately without strong consistency, and using strongly consistent tools to solve them makes systems less reliable rather than more. Strong consistency is not better consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Despite these challenges, consensus is an important building block in building highly-available systems. Distribution <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/01/02/why-distributed.html">makes building HA systems easier</a>. It's a tool, not a solution.</p>

<p>Think of using consensus in your system like getting a puppy: it may bring you a lot of joy, but with that joy comes challenges, and ongoing responsibilities. There's a lot more to dog ownership than just getting a dog. There's a lot more to high availability than picking up a Raft library off github.</p>

<p>Rust support in Emacs improved <em>a lot</em> during the past two years. This post will walk you through setting up Emacs to allow for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigating the source code (go to to implementation, list references, outline module structure)</li>
<li>Code completion</li>
<li>Code snippets</li>
<li>Highlighting errors and warnings inline</li>
<li>Apply code fixes and refactorings</li>
<li>Automatically import definitions if necessary (such as for Traits)</li>
<li>Code formatting with rustfmt</li>
<li>Building &amp; running other cargo commands</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup will be based on <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/">rust-analyzer</a>, a LSP server that is under very active development and powers the Rust support in VS Code as well.</p>
<p>This post is accompanied by a <a href="https://github.com/rksm/emacs-rust-config">github repository</a> that you can use as a reference or directly checkout and run Emacs with (<a href="#quickstart">see below</a>). I’ve tested the configuration with Emacs 27.1, rust stable 1.49.0 and on macOS 11.1, Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>For a setup that uses the emacs-racer backend<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> please see <a href="https://github.crookster.org/my-emacs-rust-language-config/">David Crook’s guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>
<p>If you have already Rust and Emacs installed (see <a href="#prerequisites">prerequisites</a>) you can get quickly up and running without modifying any of your existing configuration. The <a href="https://github.com/rksm/emacs-rust-config">rksm/emacs-rust-config github repo</a> contains a <code>standalone.el</code> file that you can use to start Emacs with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ git clone https://github.com/rksm/emacs-rust-config
$ emacs -q --load ./emacs-rust-config/standalone.el
</code></pre></div><p>This will start Emacs with an <code>.emacs.d</code> directory set to the location of the checked out repository (and a different elpa directory). This means, it will not use or modify your <code>$HOME/.emacs.d</code>. If you are unsure if you are happy with what is described here, this is an easy way to figure it out.</p>
<p>All dependencies will be installed on first startup, this means the first start will take a few seconds.</p>
<p>On windows you can use a shortcut to start Emacs with those parameters. If you are on macOS and have installed the Emacs.app you will need to start Emacs from the command line with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">/Applications//Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -q --load ./emacs-rust-config/standalone.el
</code></pre></div><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before we get to the actual Emacs configuration, please make sure your system is setup with the following.</p>
<h4 id="rust">Rust</h4>
<p>Install the rust toolchain with cargo. <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> makes that easy. Install rust stable and make sure that the <code>.cargo/bin</code> directory is in your PATH. rustup will do this by default. rust-analyzer will also need the Rust source code and you can install that with <code>rustup component add rust-src</code>.</p>
<h4 id="rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</h4>
<p>You need the rust-analyzer server binary. You can install it following the rust <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#rust-analyzer-language-server-binary">analyzer manual</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/releases">pre-compiled binaries</a> are available. However, since rust-analyzer is so actively developed I usually just clone the github repository and build the binary myself. This makes upgrading (and downgrading should it be necessary) very straightforward:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ git clone https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer.git
$ cd rust-analyzer
$ cargo xtask install --server <span># will install rust-analyzer into $HOME/.cargo/bin</span>
</code></pre></div><h4 id="emacs">Emacs</h4>
<p>I have tested the setup with Emacs 27.1. On macOS I normally use <a href="https://emacsformacosx.com/">emacsformacosx.com</a>. On Windows I use the “nearby GNU mirror” link at <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html">gnu.org/software/emacs</a>. On Ubuntu <a href="https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/09/install-emacs-27-1-ppa-ubuntu-20-04/">adding another apt repository</a> is necessary. Note that the config will likely work with older Emacs versions but Emacs 27 got substantial improvements around JSON parsing which speeds up LSP clients quite a bit.</p>
<p>Note that I use <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> for Emacs package management. It will be auto-installed in the standalone version of this config. Otherwise you can add a snippet like below to your <code>init.el</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
</code></pre><h2 id="rust-emacs-configuration-in-detail">Rust Emacs Configuration in Detail</h2>
<p>The essential modes being used are the following:</p>
<ul>

<h4 id="rustic">Rustic</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/brotzeit/rustic">rustic</a> is a fork of <code>rust-mode</code> and extends it with a number of useful features (see the its github readme). It is the core of the setup and you can use just it without any other Emacs packages (and without rust-analyzer) if you just want code highlighting and cargo commands bound to emacs shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>(use-package rustic
  :ensure
  :bind (:map rustic-mode-map
              ("M-j" . lsp-ui-imenu)
              ("M-?" . lsp-find-references)
              ("C-c C-c l" . flycheck-list-errors)
              ("C-c C-c a" . lsp-execute-code-action)
              ("C-c C-c r" . lsp-rename)
              ("C-c C-c q" . lsp-workspace-restart)
              ("C-c C-c Q" . lsp-workspace-shutdown)
              ("C-c C-c s" . lsp-rust-analyzer-status))
  :config
  ;; uncomment for less flashiness
  ;; (setq lsp-eldoc-hook nil)
  ;; (setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil)
  ;; (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil)

  ;; comment to disable rustfmt on save
  (setq rustic-format-on-save t)
  (add-hook 'rustic-mode-hook 'rk/rustic-mode-hook))

(defun rk/rustic-mode-hook ()
  ;; so that run C-c C-c C-r works without having to confirm
  (setq-local buffer-save-without-query t))
</code></pre><p>Most of rustics features are bound to the <code>C-c C-c</code> prefix (that is press Control-c twice and then another key):</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-07_rust-with-emacs/rustic-shortcuts-1.png">
    <!-- <div><pre style="font-size: small; display: inline;">C-c C-c</pre> which key</div> -->
  </figure>


<p>You can use <code>C-c C-c C-r</code> to run the program via <code>cargo run</code>. You will be asked for parameters and can for example specify <code>--release</code> to run in release mode or <code>--bin other-bin</code> to run the target named “other-bin” (instead of main.rs). To pass parameters to the executable itself use <code>-- --arg1 --arg2</code>.</p>
<p>The shortcut <code>C-c C-c C-c</code> will run the test at point. Very handy to run inline tests and to not always have switch back-and-forth between a terminal and Emacs.</p>
<p><code>C-c C-p</code> opens a popup buffer that will give you similar access to the commands shown above but will stick around.</p>
<p>Rustic provides even more helpful integration with cargo, e.g. <code>M-x rustic-cargo-add</code> will allow you to add dependencies to your projects <code>Cargo.toml</code> (via <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit">cargo-edit</a> that will be installed on demand).</p>
<p>If you would like to share a code snippet with others, <code>M-x rustic-playpen</code> will open your current buffer in <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">https://play.rust-lang.org</a> where you can run the Rust code online and get a shareable link.</p>
<p>Code formatting on save is enabled and will use rustfmt. To disable it set <code>(setq rustic-format-on-save nil)</code>. You can still format a buffer on demand using <code>C-c C-c C-o</code>.</p>
<h4 id="lsp-mode-and-lsp-ui-mode">lsp-mode and lsp-ui-mode</h4>
<p>lsp-mode provides <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-rust/">the integration</a> with rust-analyzer. It enables the IDE features such as navigating through source code, highlighting errors via flycheck (see below) and provides the auto-completion source for company (also below).</p>
<pre><code>(use-package lsp-mode
  :ensure
  :commands lsp
  :custom
  ;; what to use when checking on-save. "check" is default, I prefer clippy
  (lsp-rust-analyzer-cargo-watch-command "clippy")
  (lsp-eldoc-render-all t)
  (lsp-idle-delay 0.6)
  :config
  (add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook 'lsp-ui-mode))

(use-package lsp-ui
  :ensure
  :commands lsp-ui-mode
  :custom
  (lsp-ui-peek-always-show t)
  (lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover t)
  (lsp-ui-doc-enable nil))
</code></pre><p>lsp-ui is optional. It provides inline overlays over the symbol at point and enables code fixes at point. If you find it to flashy and prefer not activating it just remove <code>:config (add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook 'lsp-ui-mode)</code>.</p>
<p>The config shown above already disables the documentation normally shown inline by lsp-ui. This is too much for my taste as it often covers up source code. If you want to also deactivate the documentation shown in the minibuffer you can add <code>(setq lsp-eldoc-hook nil)</code>. To do less when your cursor moves consider <code>(setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil)</code> and <code>(setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil)</code>.</p>
<h4 id="code-navigation">Code navigation</h4>
<p>Having setup lsp-mode, you can use <code>M-.</code> to jump to the definition of function, structs, packages etc. when your cursor is over a symbol. <code>M-,</code> to jump back. With <code>M-?</code> you can list all references of a symbol. A little demo:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-07_rust-with-emacs/rust-lsp-demo-1.png">
  </figure>


<p>With <code>M-j</code> you can open up an outline of the current module that allows you to quickly navigate between functions and other definitions.</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-07_rust-with-emacs/imenu.png">
  </figure>


<h4 id="code-actions">Code actions</h4>
<p>Refactorings are possible using <code>M-x lsp-rename</code> and <code>lsp-execute-code-action</code>. Code actions are basically code transformation and fixes. For example the linter may find a way to express code more idiomatically:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-07_rust-with-emacs/rust-lsp-demo-2.gif">
  </figure>


<p>The number of available code actions continuously growth. A full list is available in the <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#assists-code-actions">rust-analyzer documentation</a>. Favorites include automatically importing functions or fully qualifying symbols. E.g. in a module that does not yet use HashMap, type <code>HashMap</code> and then select the option to <code>Import std::collections::HashMap</code>. Other code actions allow you to add all possible arms in a match expression or converting a <code>#[derive(Trait)]</code> into the code needed for a custom implementation. And many, many more.</p>
<p>If you developing macros, quickly seeing how they expand can be really useful. Use <code>M-x lsp-rust-analyzer-expand-macro</code> or the shortcut <code>C-c C-c e</code> to macroexpand.</p>
<h4 id="code-completion-and-snippets">Code completion and snippets</h4>
<p>lsp-mode directly integrates with <a href="https://company-mode.github.io/">company-mode</a>, a completion framework for emacs. It will display a list of possible symbols that could be inserted at the cursor. It is very helpful when working with unknown libraries (or the std lib) and reduces the need for looking up documentation. Rust’s type system is used as a source for the completions and thus what you can insert makes (mostly) sense.</p>
<p>By default the code completion popup will appear after <code>company-idle-delay</code> which is set to 0.5 seconds by default. You can modify that value or disable the auto popup completely by setting <code>company-begin-commands</code> to <code>nil</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(use-package company
  :ensure
  :custom
  (company-idle-delay 0.5) ;; how long to wait until popup
  ;; (company-begin-commands nil) ;; uncomment to disable popup
  :bind
  (:map company-active-map
	      ("C-n". company-select-next)
	      ("C-p". company-select-previous)
	      ("M-&lt;". company-select-first)</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><b>New study found that electrons can reach ultra-relativistic energies for very special conditions in the magnetosphere when space is devoid of plasma</b></p><p>Recent measurements from NASA’s Van Allen Probes spacecraft showed that electrons can reach ultra-relativistic energies flying at almost the speed of light. Hayley Allison, Yuri Shprits and collaborators from the German Research Centre for Geosciences have revealed under which conditions such strong accelerations occur. They had already demonstrated in 2020 that during solar storm plasma waves play a crucial role for that. However, it was previously unclear why such high electron energies are not achieved in all solar storms. In the journal Science Advances, Allison, Shprits and colleagues now show that extreme depletions of the background plasma density are crucial.  
</p><p><b>Ultra-relativistic electrons in space </b></p><p>At ultra-relativistic energies, electrons move at almost the speed of light. Then the laws of relativity become most important. The mass of the particles increases by a factor ten, time is slowing down, and distance decreases. With such high energies, charged particles become most dangerous to even the best protected satellites. As almost no shielding can stop them, their charge can destroy sensitive electronics. Predicting their occurrence - for example, as part of the observations of space weather practised at the GFZ - is therefore very important for modern infrastructure. 
</p><p>To investigate the conditions for the enormous accelerations of the electrons, Allison and Shprits used data from a twin mission, the "Van Allen Probes", which the US space agency NASA had launched in 2012. The aim was to make detailed measurements in the radiation belt, the so-called Van Allen belt, which surrounds the Earth in a donut shape in terrestrial space. Here - as in the rest of space - a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles forms a so-called plasma. Plasma waves can be understood as fluctuations of the electric and magnetic field, excited by solar storms. They are an important driving force for the acceleration of electrons.  
</p><p><b>Data analysis with machine learning </b></p><p>During the mission, both solar storms that produced ultra-relativistic electrons and storms without this effect were observed. The density of the background plasma turned out to be a decisive factor for the strong acceleration: electrons with the ultra-relativistic energies were only observed to increase when the plasma density dropped to very low values of only about ten particles per cubic centimetre, while normally such density is five to ten times higher.  Using a numerical model that incorporated such extreme plasma depletion, the authors showed that periods of low density create preferential conditions for the acceleration of electrons - from an initial few hundred thousand to more than seven million electron volts. To analyse the data from the Van Allen probes, the researchers used machine learning methods, the development of which was funded by the GEO.X network. They enabled the authors to infer the total plasma density from the measured fluctuations of electric and magnetic field.  
</p><p><b>The crucial role of plasma </b></p><p>"This study shows that electrons in the Earth's radiation belt can be promptly accelerated locally to ultra-relativistic energies, if the conditions of the plasma environment - plasma waves and temporarily low plasma density - are right. The particles can be regarded as surfing on plasma waves. In regions of extremely low plasma density they can just take a lot of energy from plasma waves. Similar mechanisms may be at work in the magnetospheres of the outer planets such as Jupiter or Saturn and in other astrophysical objects”, says Yuri Shprits, head of the GFZ section Space physics and space weather and Professor at University of Potsdam.  “Thus, to reach such extreme energies, a two-stage acceleration process is not needed, as long assumed - first from the outer region of the magnetosphere into the belt and then inside. This also supports our research results from last year," adds Hayley Allison, PostDoc in the Section Space physics and space weather.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

			<p>One recently-completed project I mentioned in January’s <a href="https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2021/01/Now-Jan-2021.html">“Now” post</a> was locking down SSH in my personal computing infrastructure using Yubikeys. In this post, I’ll outline my goals, the strategy I took, and the problems and solutions I ran into along the way.</p>

<h2>Goals &amp; Strategy</h2>

<p>Historically, I’ve used a pretty basic SSH setup for my personal projects: my user account on every laptop/desktop/server had its own key in <code>~/.ssh</code>, and I’d try to keep the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> lists on all my servers more-or-less up-to-date. This presents a number of obvious security problems.</p>

<p>I wanted to ensure that, should an attacker gain access to one of my servers, they can’t use that access to move onto any other computer I control. To do this, I moved to using a few <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikeys</a> to store my SSH keys; there’s no longer key material stored on any server for a hypothetical attacker to steal. The Yubikeys require a PIN, so this is an example of two-factor authentication: something I physically have, and something I know.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/25/what-is-ssh-agent-forwarding-and-how-do-you-use-it/">SSH agent forwarding</a> is used to allow me to SSH from one server to another or fetch code from GitHub on a remote server. With <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, my preferred agent software, every single SSH operation — yes, even those performed via agent forwarding — requires a physical touch to confirm.</p>

<p>I use a private Git repository to synchronize SSH configuration (including <code>authorized_keys</code>, the list of public keys corresponding to my Yubikeys) between machines, with a modular local configuration system allowing me to quickly enable commonly-used SSH configuration blocks which only apply to a subset of my machines.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Yubikeys</h3>

<p>I found it easiest by far to use <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a> for this project. It’s pretty straightforward to set this up; the real work was figuring out how to smooth out the various difficulties I encountered later.</p>

<p>(The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<p>Install <code>yubikey-agent</code> with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code>brew tap filippo.io/yubikey-agent https://filippo.io/yubikey-agent
brew install yubikey-agent
brew services start yubikey-agent
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>yubikey-agent -setup</code> to generate a new SSH key on your Yubikey.</p>

<p>Set the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable (do this in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>). In <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/zsh/.zshrc#L24">my dotfiles</a>, I first check that <code>yubikey-agent</code> is installed, then proceed:</p>

<pre><code>command -v yubikey-agent &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock"
</code></pre>

<p>Enable SSH agent forwarding for a specific, trusted host (don’t enable it for all hosts; that’s a potential security issue) by adding <code>ForwardAgent yes</code> to that host’s block in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. A complete example might look like:</p>

<pre><code>Host dzombak.com
    User chris
    HostName dzombak.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit of a spoiler for a topic later in this blog post, but we’ll also add this to our <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host *
    IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
</code></pre>

<p>This allows apps started from outside your terminal — like the GUI Git client, <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork.app</a> — to find and use <code>yubikey-agent</code>.</p>

<h4>A note: Secretive.app</h4>

<p>I’d like to use the new macOS app <a href="https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive">Secretive</a>, which stores SSH keys in the Secure Enclave on newer MacBooks and requires Touch ID to authenticate. Unfortunately, for Reasons™ I’m still using macOS Mojave, and Secretive requires Catalina or Big Sur. I plan to move to Big Sur soon enough, since I want to get an M1 MacBook Pro when the 16” models are released, so I’ll be able to try Secretive soon enough. (Worth noting, this changes the security model somewhat, as the second factor is biometric rather than a PIN, but it’s still two factors.)</p>

<h3>Server Configuration</h3>

<p>Of course, moving to Yubikeys doesn’t solve much if your servers still allow password logins. On every server, in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, I set the following. Make this change only after you’ve set up a Yubikey and added it to <code>authorized_keys</code> for your user account on the server!</p>

<pre><code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
</code></pre>

<p>(That last line — <code>PermitRootLogin no</code> — ensures that logins as <code>root</code> via SSH are never allowed, which is a good SSH best practice unrelated to Yubikeys.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-restart-ssh/">Restart the SSH service</a>, and immediately — before logging out — open a new terminal window and test that you can still login to the server with your Yubikey.</p>

<p>macOS tends to lose changes to <code>sshd_config</code> during OS upgrades, so after installing macOS updates I make sure to check that my SSH server configuration is intact.</p>

<h3>Git repo for SSH configuration</h3>

<p>I keep my <code>~/.ssh</code> directory, with a few important exceptions (keys are never committed!), in a private Git repo. This allows me to sync configuration and <code>authorized_keys</code> changes between systems easily. I’ve created a stripped-down version at <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">cdzombak/ssh-example</a> which you can use as a basis for your own setup.</p>

<p>I’ll walk through the highlights here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md"><code>README.md</code></a> covers initial installation &amp; setup.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/authorized_keys"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> is where you’ll add the public keys associated with the new, private SSH keys on your Yubikeys.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config"><code>config</code></a> is where you’ll add <code>Host</code> blocks for your servers. At the top, it sets some SSH best practices that I’ve accumulated over the years.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/fix-permissions.sh"><code>fix-permissions.sh</code></a> ensures that <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and <code>~/.ssh/rc</code> have the correct permissions. I run this after pulling from the repository; if it results in any changes the files’ permissions in the repo should be corrected.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc"><code>rc</code></a> runs after I log into a machine via SSH. In this case, it updates a symlink in <code>~/.ssh/sock</code> to point to the new SSH agent socket. See the “Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions” section, below, for an explanation on why this is necessary.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.templates"><code>config.templates/</code></a> contains SSH configuration blocks which <em>can</em> be included on a given machine, but shouldn’t be included everywhere. The most important of these are <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, which when enabled sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the <code>yubikey-agent</code> socket as described above; and <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock"><code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code></a>, which sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the symlink <code>rc</code> creates after an SSH login. On any given machine, I enable one and only one of these two configurations, depending whether it’s a client machine with Yubikey attached or a server which will rely on agent forwarding for any outgoing SSH connections.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.local"><code>config.local/</code></a> is <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config#L2">included by</a> <code>config</code> and ignored by Git. I can add symlinks from here to <code>config.templates</code> to enable a specific SSH configuration block on the machine.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those last two — <code>config.local</code> and <code>config.templates</code> — are important, because that’s how I achieve variations in SSH configuration between different machines. <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md#configuration">The README covers</a> how to enable config templates on a given computer.</p>

<h2>Challenges &amp; Solutions</h2>

<h3>Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions</h3>

<p>I use GNU <code>screen</code> (yes, still; I haven’t bothered to learn <code>tmux</code>) as a terminal multiplexer and to provide persistence between SSH sessions. This was a problem for SSH agent forwarding: when I first SSH in and start a <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable would be set. But when I logged in from somewhere else and reattached to the <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable wouldn’t get updated, so SSH agent forwarding was broken until I started a new <code>screen</code> session.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/martijnvermaat/8070533">This Gist</a> helped me fix this situation. There are a few parts to this solution. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>First, we have to have a location for our SSH agent socket that doesn’t change between logins. These few lines in <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc#L5-L7"><code>~/.ssh/rc</code></a> achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>if test "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ; then
    ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Great! Then we just need clients to use this new, always-updated socket. To do this, we configure <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/screen/.screenrc#L31-L32"><code>~/.screenrc</code></a> to set the environment variable <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code>:</p>

<pre><code>setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK $HOME/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we’ll also want to include <code>IdentityAgent ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock</code> in our SSH configuration. We can do this by including the <code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code> configuration block within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock .
</code></pre>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding when running commands under sudo</h3>

<p>When running a command with <code>sudo</code>, you’re working in a new environment; your user’s environment variables are not preserved. This will, of course, break SSH agent forwarding.</p>

<p>To solve this, we want to preserve the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable when using <code>sudo</code>. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>Run <code>visudo</code> (as <code>root</code>) to edit your <code>sudoers</code> file, and add:</p>

<pre><code>Defaults&gt;root    env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK
</code></pre>

<p>This means that when using <code>sudo</code> to run a command as <code>root</code> (not as any other user), your <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> variable remains intact, and agent forwarding works as expected.</p>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding via <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> doesn’t work with GUI macOS apps</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ForkIssues/Tracker/issues/44">This issue in the Fork app’s issue tracker</a> was really helpful here. <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.zshrc</code> don’t apply to GUI apps (unless you launch them from the terminal), so setting <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> <em>only</em> in shell configuration files won’t work.</p>

<p>This is why we need <code>IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock</code> in our SSH configuration. To enable this within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/yubikey-agent .
</code></pre>

<p>(This change applies to macOS client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<h3>Avoiding repeated mystery Yubikey prompts (using HTTPS for GitHub and Bitbucket repositories)</h3>

<p>After I set this up, my Yubikey would periodically blink as if I were trying to SSH into something, but I hadn’t tried to do anything with SSH! That was worrying, until I realized it was just <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork</a> trying to update repository info in the background.</p>

<p>I decided to configure Git on my laptops to use HTTPS instead of SSH when communicating with GitHub and Bitbucket, so Fork can work in the background as it desires.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll add the following to <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. (This …</p></article></div>

<p><i>PWAs are powerful, effective, fast and app-like. It's hard to imagine a mobile web property that could not be significantly improved via PWA implementation. They can also potentially eliminate the need for many vanity native apps that exist today. progressive web apps are for everyone, desktop and mobile users alike. I think it’s important to reiterate that there is no mobile web.</i></p>

<p>Progressive web apps have taken functionality from both native and web apps. They can run fast regardless of mobile operating systems and device types also providing rich functionality as if they were developed for a specific device. Thanks to easy installation, discoverability, automated updates, slow network or even the offline work mode, PWAs can enhance user experience.</p>

<h3 id="Low_Development_Costs">Low Development Costs</h3>
<p>PWAs do not require different versions for various devices; a single progressive app meets the requirements of all endpoints on which it operates. So, it significantly reduces the amount of efforts that developers provide, and as a result, the cost to create a PWA decreases. The cost is three or four times lower than that of a native mobile app.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="App_Like_Look_and_Feel">App-Like Look and Feel</h3>
<p>Nowadays, mobile users prefer apps to browsers as applications compare favorably with browsers, as they are more user-friendly, can operate offline and have a more attractive interface. Progressive web applications provide an advanced user experience by combining the look and feel of mobile applications and the best of website performance.</p>
</section>
 <section>
<h3 id="Fast_Installation">Fast Installation</h3>
<p>Unlike regular mobile applications, PWAs do not require a long and complex installation process, which significantly improves user experience. Users just download an app, quickly and directly to their devices, and they do not need to go to the App Store or Google Play. It streamlines the procedure and significantly reduces user abandonment.</p>

<p>Their performance is also not as good as the performance of native apps, which has a lot to do with the fact that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>org-d20 is a minor mode for Emacs’ <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>
for GMs running games whose rules centre around rolling d20s.  It
should be useful for <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> 3rd, 4th and 5th editions,
Paizo’s <em>Pathfinder</em>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_System">d20 System</a> games like <em>d20
Modern</em>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you’re already keeping your campaign notes in an
Org-mode file.  This minor mode does useful things for you while you
are visiting that buffer.  For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rolling dice, with 5e’s advantage and disadvantage displayed in case
those are needed;</p></li>
<li><p>tracking combat turns and rounds right next to your existing
description of the monsters and the terrain.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The minor mode’s defaults suit the way that I run D&amp;D 5e.  Patches to
add <code>defcustoms</code> to make org-d20 more suitable for other games, and
other sets of house rules, are welcome.</p>

<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

			<p><span>For almost as long as we’ve been tracking the COVID-19 pandemic, sf.citi has been closely monitoring the San Francisco tech exodus. Of course, some of the forces driving this phenomenon—remote work and the growing appeal of cities beyond San Francisco—predate 2020. Few can argue, however, that the pandemic has accelerated these trends. What we’re seeing today is nothing short of a mass migration of tech companies and tech employees outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><span>To help you keep up with fast-moving data surrounding the San Francisco tech exodus, sf.citi created an all-in-one resource. Below, you’ll find the latest insights about tech’s relocation, the economic implications of a tech exodus in San Francisco, and context around the policies that have led us to where we are today.</span></p>

<li><span>Near the end of 2020, City Controller Ben Rosenfield announced that San Francisco had not met its projected tax revenue targets, and the City faces an </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/S-F-City-Hall-faces-another-big-budget-deficit-15717821.php"><span>additional budget deficit of $116 million</span></a><span>. That’s on top of the $1.5 billion budget deficit the City had to close in 2020. And in a </span><a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/Five%20Year%20Financial%20Plan%20FY21-22%20through%20FY%2025-26.pdf"><span>five-year budget forecast</span></a><span>, the City Controller’s Office predicts hundreds of millions of dollars in budget shortfalls over the next five years due to a widening gap between the City’s revenues and expenses.</span></li>
<li><span>Current and future San Francisco budget deficits are directly tied to losses in hotel, business, and sales taxes. The San Francisco Business Times </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/02/05/0205-foc-sanfrancisco.html"><span>reported</span></a><span> that the City expected close to $1.5 billion in business taxes in 2019-2020 but ended the fiscal year $228 million under budget.</span></li>
<li>From April to June 2020, revenue from San Francisco’s local sales tax dropped to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/S-F-sales-tax-data-shows-likely-population-15632448.php">$30.8 million</a>, a decrease of 43 percent from 2019. Stay-at-home orders resulted in steep declines in brick-and-mortar sales taxes throughout the Bay Area. All of the counties surrounding San Francisco, however, saw increases in online sales taxes while San Francisco registered only a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Yes-people-are-leaving-San-Francisco-After-15635160.php">1 percent increase</a>—the worst showing among California’s 20 largest counties. Speaking to the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/S-F-sales-tax-data-shows-likely-population-15632448.php">San Francisco Chronicle,</a> San Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan attributes the drop in revenue to “tech people moving.”</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://altcampus.school/images/posts/4-systems-learn-programming-faster-altcampus.png" alt="Systems to learn programming faster"></p>
<h3>1. Learn in public</h3>
<p>Learning in public means sharing whatever you are learning publicly. It could be through tweets, blog posts, videos, cartoons etc. The idea is to teach whatever you have learnt or share whatever you have created.</p>
<p>It helps in keeping you accountable, consistent and motivated. You increase the surface area of getting feedback and networking with other.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that you can do to get started</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweet everyday about your progress</li>
<li>Write blog posts on whatever you have learnt</li>
</ul>
<p>To get inspiration, look at the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=AltCampus">students of AltCampus tweeting their progress publicly</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about this idea, read this fantastic article - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a></p>
<h3>2. Solve the problem on the paper</h3>
<p>One of the biggest problems with newbies is that they are just so excited to write code that they jump into the text editor the minute they have a problem statement. The problem with this approach is that you are actually not taking the time out to understand and think about the solution of the problem.</p>
<p>Resist the temptation of writing code straightaway. Code is nothing but a medium to implement the solution. Actual solution is in the thought process and the approach that you take.</p>
<p>Always keep a pen and paper handy when you are learning. Anytime you get a problem, understand it, break it down. Write. Draw. Write steps in plain words, also called pseudo code. Solve the problem on the paper first. Once you know what the right approach is, start converting the pseudo code into actual code in your text editor.</p>
<h3>3. Find a feedback mechanism, someone to give you feedback or do code review</h3>
<p>If you are not good at something how do you know if what you are doing is actually good or if you are improving at all?</p>
<p>What helps is having someone senior to give you constructive feedback. Feedback on what you are doing right, wrong. Feedback on how to improve the structure of your code.</p>
<p>When you have someone to get feedback from, you know what you need to fix and thus your pace of learning increases. This idea of getting feedback and then acting on it and again seeking feedback is called feedback loop. The shorter the loop in time frame, the faster you learn.</p>
<p>At AltCampus we focus heavily on feedback. Mentors provide regular feedback to students on a granular level like assignments and checkpoints.</p>
<h3>4.  Actually build something. Don't be in tutorial hell.</h3>
<p>A problem with newbies that they keep switching from one tutorial to another, one course to another, without actually using the knowledge to build something. This is partly because most of the courses just focus on delivering concepts via video or text. Assignments and projects are missing.</p>
<p>The actual learning happens when you are using those concepts to build a project. For e.g. if you recently learnt about tags, elements etc in HTML, did you actually use to build a webpage from scratch?</p>
<p>Don't be stuck in tutorial hell. Pick a good course that has everything in it and then build stuff. Building accelerates your pace of putting things together. Building is where fun and learning is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg" alt="Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora"></p><figcaption>Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.</p>
<h3>Why are NFTs interesting?</h3>
<p>NFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.</p>
<p>NFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.com/">NIFTEX</a>), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. <a href="https://nftfi.com/">NFTfi</a>). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game <a href="http://aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a> combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.</p>

<p>NFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>NFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.</p>
<p>Programmable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg" alt="Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night"></p><figcaption>Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg" alt="Osinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted"></p><figcaption>Osinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted</figcaption></figure>
<p>A common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21">$3.5 million</a> from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg" alt="Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale"></p><figcaption>Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale</figcaption></figure>
<p>Digital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a <a href="https://superrare.co/thevault/collection">SuperRare profile</a> as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com/">Cryptovoxels</a>, a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg" alt="Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels"></p><figcaption>Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels</figcaption></figure>
<p>A common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.</p>
<p>With NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner">T206 Honus Wagner baseball card</a> was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&amp;">counterfeit Black Lotus</a> cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Steam, a popular video game platform, has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/?">Community Market</a> where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg" alt="Steam Community Market"></p><figcaption>Steam Community Market</figcaption></figure>
<p>Steam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html">DotA 2 pink war dog courier</a> for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/">CryptoKitty</a>. Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price">Black Lotus</a> card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.</p>
<p>Decentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/">100 million players</a> in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a> and <a href="https://www.skyweaver.net/">SkyWeaver</a> are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg" alt="Gods Unchained"></p><figcaption>Gods Unchained</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the most popular games in crypto is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>. You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The game has become popular in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid">Philippines</a> and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even <a href="https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/">beating minimum wage</a> in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even <a href="https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/">purchased</a> for $159,000 total.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/26353bcc-0d05-47ea-89ac-fcdc9d2dd848.jpeg" alt="Axie Infinity battle"></p><figcaption>Axie Infinity battle</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s another popular game <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg" alt="Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT"></p><figcaption>Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT</figcaption></figure>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>If you don’t know what you don’t know, it’s hard to learn it. There are so many resources for learning, but if you can’t find them, you’re going to have a hard time taking advantage of them. Sometimes you need to spend time learning what you need to spend time learning. That is to say, you need to learn the broad outlines of a segment of knowledge before diving in.</p>



<p>This time spent prepping your understanding of swathes of a domain will be useful because it will accelerate your learning in the future, letting you grasp concepts and find resources more quickly.</p>



<p>Let’s say I got hired by a company to write a compiler, which would be a new area of software for me. Here are some things I would do if I were trying to learn this new domain. </p>



<p><strong>Glossaries</strong></p>



<p>I’d look for some glossaries about compiler design. Here’s the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/cs375vocab.html">first result</a> from Google when I search for “compiler design glossary”. Reading this would help me understand the meaning of words I might know from other contexts, such as “array” and “value”, but would encounter when reading more about compilers. Knowing the jargon of a domain is extremely helpful when you are searching to see whose shoulders you can stand on, as well as communicating with your team members.</p>



<p><strong>Pattern match</strong></p>



<p>Matching patterns is something I’ve done many times. I take something I understand fairly well and see whether it matches up to a new concept, domain, or technology. In this case, I might read about a compiler for parsing regular expressions. I understand how regular expressions work as an end user, so it won’t be as much of a leap as if I were to try to study a compiler for C. Here’s a <a href="https://kean.blog/post/lets-build-regex">search result</a> that I might work through.</p>



<p><strong>Books and videos</strong></p>



<p>If I have time, books and videos can be very helpful at getting a wider view of a domain. Sometimes it’s hard to know which book or video to invest your time in. By looking at reviews on sites like Amazon and Youtube, you can leverage the wisdom of many people. I’d probably <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=compiler+design&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">start with one of the top books here</a>, were I to need to jump into compiler design. When I do this, I don’t feel the need to read the entire book or watch every minute of the video. </p>



<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>



<p>You can use Twitter to “get smart quick” too. Basically, you can follow folks who are highly regarded by other folks in the same domain. Wesley did a great job of explaining it, so I’ll just point you to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bu9bo5bpyjxhtas/AACIKdI_wmU5XBhfTZ61oAZBa?dl=0&amp;preview=Wesley+Faulkner+%26+Lorna+Mitchell%3A+Twitter+Strategies.mp4">this video</a>. You want to watch between 15:53 and 20:00, where he talks about getting smart around “quantum computing”. Once you know who to follow on Twitter because they are respected by the community, you can start figuring out the words and concepts they use.</p>



<p><strong>Follow some rabbits down holes</strong></p>



<p>I’m a big fan of timeboxing investigations, and I always tell team members I am mentoring that they shouldn’t spin their wheels too long; far better to ask a team member. But sometimes, when you are exploring a new domain, you should spin your wheels a bit. Follow some paths and see if they end up where you thought, or if they were dead ends. In this stage of knowledge gathering, there are no wasted efforts. Any time you “waste” investigating or following some threads of discussion will compound and save you time in the future. Do take some notes, either mental or written (I like a blog post, <a href="http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3144">as I did here</a>). Don’t feel like you need to come up with any firm answers. And feel free to timebox it, just make the time limit higher than it would be if you were actually trying to solve a problem. </p>



<p><strong>Take a class</strong></p>



<p>One time I was working on a project at a real estate brokerage where we wanted to do statistical analysis on property data. I didn’t have much background on it, so I ended up taking a free class from Coursera. This is a substantial time investment, but for foundational knowledge that you can leverage across other parts of your life (I’m a lot more suspicious of stats I see now), the additional time can be worth it. </p>



<p>Pick the technique that resonates with you next time you have to get smart quickly about a topic or technology. Spend some time investing in your upfront knowledge and I promise it will pay dividends as you dig deeper.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

					<div>
						<p>The 21st century has seen some phenomenal advances in our ability to make scientific discoveries. Scientists have developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">new technology</a> to build vaccines swiftly, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">new algorithms</a> to predict the structure of proteins accurately, <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data">new equipment</a> to sequence DNA rapidly, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">new engineering solutions</a> to harvest energy efficiently. But in many fields of science, reliable knowledge and progress advance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">staggeringly</a> <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/11/is-the-rate-of-scientific-progress-slowing-down.html">slowly</a>. What slows it down? And what can we learn from individual fields of science to pick up the pace across the board – without compromising on quality?</p>
<p>By and large, scientific research is published in journals in the form of papers – static documents that do not update with new data or new methods. Instead of sharing the data and the code that produces their results, most scientists simply publish a textual description of their research in online publications. These publications are usually hidden behind paywalls, making it harder for outsiders to verify their authenticity.</p>
<p>On the occasion when a reader spots a discrepancy in the data or an error in the methods, they must read the intricate details of a study’s method scrupulously, and cross-check the statistics manually. When scientists don’t share the data to produce their results openly, the task becomes even harder. The process of error correction – from scientists publishing a paper, to readers spotting errors, to having the paper corrected or retracted – can take <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/26/university-asked-numerous-retractions-eight-months-later-three-journals-done-nothing/">years</a>, assuming those errors are spotted at all.</p>
<p>When scientists reference previous research, they cite entire papers, not specific results or values from them. And although there is <a href="https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/does-science-self-correct">evidence</a> that scientists hold back from citing papers once they have been retracted, the problem is compounded over time – consider, for example, a researcher who cites a study that itself derives its data or assumptions from prior research that has been disputed, corrected or retracted. The longer it takes to sift through the science, to identify which results are accurate, the longer it takes to gather an understanding of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>What makes the problem even more challenging is that flaws in a study are not necessarily mathematical errors. In many situations, researchers make fairly arbitrary decisions as to how they collect their data, which methods they apply to analyse them, and which results they report – altogether leaving readers blind to the impact of these decisions on the results.</p>
<p>This murkiness can result in what is known as p-hacking: when researchers selectively apply arbitrary methods in order to achieve a particular result. For example, in a study that compares the well-being of overweight people to that of underweight people, researchers may find that certain cut-offs of weight (or certain subgroups in their sample) provide the result they’re looking for, while others don’t. And they may decide to only publish the particular methods that provided that result.</p>
<p>If a reader can’t find out how different versions of a study method have affected the results, how are they to know whether the finding really was robust – that it would be found regardless of how the data was looked at?</p>
<p>Now, it’s common to assume that these errors and flaws are largely smoothed out during the process of peer review, where peer scientists are asked to scrutinise a study and recommend to journal editors whether it should be revised or even published at all. But unfortunately peer review often fails to accomplish this, as the scientist Stuart Ritchie has described in his book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250222695"><i>Science Fictions</i></a>.</p>
<p>Substandard methods and questionable research practices are widespread even in published work. There is an enormous number of journals available, with different standards of publication, in which scientists can publish their work if they are rejected by some. And many lines of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full">evidence</a> suggest that ‘high impact’ journals (journals which are said to be highly reputable and have a wide reach) accept papers with similar or weaker methods than low-impact journals do.</p>
<p>Peer review instead functions predominantly as a practice of gatekeeping, as the philosophers of science Liam Bright and Remco Heesen have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjps/axz029/5526887">explained</a>. Reviewers provide scientists with comments that are rarely made public. Whether research is published in a particular journal largely depends on the idiosyncratic decisions of reviewers who are available at the time and who are liked by the journal’s editors.</p>
<p>Peer review filters which research is published, with no use of transparent metrics for others to understand the reasoning behind these choices. The lack of transparency lends itself to misconduct – reviewers may discourage the publishing of science that challenges the prevailing consensus of the time or fails to replicate it – and hype, encouraging the publication of results that seem exciting over those that provide nuance.</p>
<p>These decisions have consequences, because journals are the dominant platform for sharing scientific research. When non-scientists, who want to apply scientific knowledge elsewhere, read research, they have little way of knowing which methods are sound and which results are reproducible or replicable.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>Reproducibility relates to whether the results can be reproduced using the same data and code as in the original analysis. Replicability relates to whether other scientists find similar results in their own studies.</span>
	 Other scientists can face the same problems, finding it difficult to assess the state of knowledge in a field, particularly if they have expertise in a different subject. This is troubling: the longer it takes to sift through the research to find out which results are reliable, the longer it takes to apply knowledge to solve new problems.</p>
<p>This view paints a bleak picture of the state of scientific knowledge, and the question that arises is: is all of science like this?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the answer is no. But unfortunately, many good practices are fairly modern and limited to specific domains. Here are some of them.</p>
<p>The remarkable <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">breakthrough</a> by DeepMind in 2020 – in accurately predicting the folded structure of proteins using only the code of protein sequences – was made possible because DeepMind’s AlphaFold algorithm was trained using data from <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/index">Protein Data Bank</a>, a vast public database that dates back to 1971. Molecular scientists have been carefully applying difficult laboratory techniques to establish the structure of proteins and have manually submitted information about them to this database <a href="https://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2008/01/00/sc5004/">for decades</a>. In parallel, data managers have been reviewing each of their submissions for accuracy. The platform now harbours over 150,000 curated entries of protein structures.</p>
<p>With databases like this, the benefits to other scientists are enormous: specifically, understanding the structure of proteins can help scientists design precise drugs that fit into them, as has been done for the <a href="https://cen.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/structural-biology/structural-biologists-revealed-new-coronaviruss/98/i17">spike protein</a> of the coronavirus. It can also help them understand why resistance to a drug has developed, such as in <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-protein-data-bank-exploring-biomolecular-structure-14199109/">HIV research</a>. But more broadly, individual researchers no longer have to rediscover these protein structures over and over again if they have already been shared publicly, if they want to use that knowledge for other purposes.</p>
<p>The practice of sharing data is also the norm in the neighbouring field of genomics. The tradition largely stems from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">Human Genome Project</a>, which began in 1990 and aimed to determine the entire code of the human genome. During the project, a group of scientists developed protocols called the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-083115-022515">Bermuda Principles</a>, which recommended that labs working on the project should upload the details of any new genetic sequences that they discovered onto public data repositories on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Though the project was completed in 2003, the movement paved the way for data sharing principles in many genetic projects to come, such as the HapMap project, the 1000 Genomes project, dbGaP, and more recently, GISAID and NextStrain – two databases which publicly share genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span>The HapMap project is a project that maps common genetic mutations of the human genome, while the 1000 Genomes project aims to develop a map of rare genetic mutations. dbGaP is a database of genetic mutations that are associated with medical traits and diseases.</span>
	 As with protein databases, these open sharing practices are remarkably important in genomics, in particular because they allow scientists to investigate a large number of genes and mutations at the same time, each detailed with a large amount of information that other scientists have collected.</p>
<p>These databases are immensely useful in sharing <i>data</i> for other researchers to analyse, but different tools are necessary for researchers to share the code used to <i>analyse data</i> – for example, if they want to test specific hypotheses. Some researchers voluntarily share their analysis code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://osf.io/">OSF</a>, two platforms where people can upload their data, code and research plans and update them when changes are made. But the practice of sharing code is not widely used by scientists even within these fields.</p>
<p>In computer science however, there are examples of journals that work with version control tools like Git. Take <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/">JOSS</a> as an illustration, a journal that publishes research describing open source software. JOSS is actually built upon the platform of GitHub: software developers submit their software together with working papers describing them to the journal via GitHub, and the journal’s reviewers provide comments on their code and suggest revisions to their work publicly. Both reviewers’ comments and past versions of the software are therefore transparent and accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Apart from these examples of sharing data and code openly, some fields already commonly try to tackle p-hacking and other questionable research practices, described before. In economics, researchers typically perform “<a href="http://www.nickchk.com/robustness.html">robustness checks</a>” to demonstrate that their …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I fancied getting an eink screen to use for future projects. I bought a wee one with a raspberry pi “hat” attached. However, I realised later that I could maybe just re-purpose an old Amazon Kindle ebook reader.</p>



<p>I’ve messed with Kindles before, ages ago: I ported an <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/09/kif-an-infocom-text-adventure-interpreter-for-the-kindle/">Infocom interpreter</a> and a <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/20/mangle-a-better-manga-reader-for-the-kindle/">Manga</a> reader to it. I managed to get Amazon’s own software to load them as “Kindlets” and show them integrated into their ebook reader. However, now I just want a nice cheap Linux based eink development platform.</p>



<p>Cheap Kindle From Ebay (and why)</p>



<p>So, off to ebay I went! I saw a number of really cheap ones marked “BLOCKED BY AMAZON”; I decided not to go for these since theoretically they might have been stolen. In the end, I went for £7 Kindle 4 “non-touch”.</p>



<p>A few days later, it turned up. And I discovered <em>why</em> it might have been so cheap: its stuck in some sort of unquittable demo mode:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1725" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_demo_mode/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg" data-orig-size="892,1239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_demo_mode" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737 737w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=108 108w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216 216w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=768 768w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg 892w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px"></figure>



<p>I did some googling and although it seems later Kindle versions can be un-demo-mode-ed, nothing seemed to work for this version. I don’t actually care though; I don’t want to run the original Kindle ebook software on this.</p>



<p>So, the next step is to gain access. Browsing the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=166687">mobileread forums</a> showed it has a debug serial port: time to open the case!</p>



<p>Physical Access Granted!</p>



<p>This was kinda tricky! There are multiple clips all round it and the case is glued onto the battery compartment, so judicious application of a Big Knife was required to persuade it to let go. I cleaned the glue up with some Acetone.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1729" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_illustrated/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg" data-orig-size="998,1331" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_illustrated" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg?w=768" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg?w=768" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg?w=768 768w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg?w=112 112w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg?w=225 225w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_illustrated.jpg 998w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure>



<ul><li>Red: annoying clips</li><li>Purple: <strong>really</strong> annoying glue.</li><li>Yellow: the serial port!</li></ul>



<p>As usual for this sort of thing, the serial port is missing its socket, so we need to solder onto the tiny contacts on the board. I like to use ~0.2mm wirewrap wire for this sort of thing, and the surface mount rework bit for my soldering iron:</p>







<p>I don’t want to leave any wires flapping about, but I also know at some point I’m going to screw up and need serial port console access, so I came up with a solution and attached it:</p>







<p>I superglued a piece of Veroboard onto the kindle’s PCB, then soldered wirewrap wires from the tiny PCB contacts onto one end. Finally, I soldered a larger, more conventional “Dupont” cable socket on the other end so I could easily attach and detach from it. Oh, the top cable on the Kindle PCB is 0v/GND, the others are TX and RX (I forget the order of those two).</p>



<p>Final hurdle: the kindle serial port runs at 1.8v, so I needed a serial port adaptor which supports that:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1737" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_usbserial/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg" data-orig-size="545,828" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_usbserial" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg 545w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=99 99w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197 197w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"></figure>



<p>The one I bought does 5v. 3.3v, 2.5v, and 1.8v: it’s pretty neat!</p>



<p>Root Access Granted!</p>



<p>Next, I attached the serial adapter to my laptop, ran the <strong>minicom</strong> serial port software and rebooted the Kindle. Then, once I (inevitably) swapped the TX and RX wires around, I was greeted by this!</p>

Welcome to Kindle!

kindle login: </code></pre>



<p>Great, so that’s booting the uboot bootloader, then booting into linux and asking me to login.</p>



<p>Trying to login as root prompts for a password: Hmm… However, I already knew from previous Kindle stuff that you can generate the password from the serial number. I found <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">this website</a> which generates a number of possible passwords for a specific device: Mine was the third on the list.</p>



<p>In case that site dies here’s the key snippet of Javascript:</p>



<pre><code>var md5 = hex_md5(serial);
document.getElementById("rootpw").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,11);
document.getElementById("rootpw2").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,10);
document.getElementById("rootpw3").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substr(13,3);</code></pre>



<p>Oh: I forgot to mention how I extracted the device’s serial number. Well, plugging it into USB doesn’t really “work”: you can’t mount these demo devices as disks. But, under linux, it still outputs the serial number in linux’s <strong>dmesg</strong> output (you can also get it using <strong>printenv</strong> in uboot if you press enter when it says “Hit any key to stop autoboot”):</p>



<pre><code>[128033.676587] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 51 using xhci_hcd
[128033.829631] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1949, idProduct=0004, bcdDevice= 1.00

[128033.829648] usb 1-2: SerialNumber: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</code></pre>



<p>Cool! We have root and can login! Now to figure out how to make it a bit easier to do stuff on it.</p>



<p>Dumping The System</p>



<p>First step is usually to dump the disks for analysis on another computer.</p>



<p>Checking <code>/proc/mounts</code> shows multiple partitions of the main disk on <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>.</p>



<p>Running <code>fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</code> gives the following:</p>



<pre><code>Units = cylinders of 64 * 512 = 32768 bytes

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/mmcblk0p1   *        1025       12224      358400  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p2           12225       14272       65536  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p3           14273       15296       32768  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p4           15297       59776     1423360   b Win95 FAT32</code></pre>



<ul><li>So, four partitions, three linux, and one FAT32. </li><li>The first disk starts quite far into the disk: turns out the kernel is stored in that “missing” area. </li><li>Poking about a bit more shows partition 1 is the normal system, 2 is a sort of diagnostic tool partition, 3 is for storing internal private state of the kindle (eg wifi passwords). Finally, 4 is the one you see when you plug a kindle in over USB: its where your books would reside.</li><li>Partition 4 is mounted at /mnt/us.</li></ul>



<p>I dumped the start of the disk and partitions 1-3 onto /mnt/us using dd (I like to take a complete raw image if I can so I can restore it in case something goes wrong):</p>



<pre><code>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/mnt/us/kindle.img bs=32768 count=15297</code></pre>



<p>Although this Kindle doesn’t show a disk over USB, since I have root, I can simply make it do it:</p>



<pre><code>rmmod g_file_storage
modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p4</code></pre>



<p>It popped up on my laptop so I copied everything off.</p>



<p>System Analysis</p>



<p>Finally, I mounted the partitions in kindle.img on my laptop with:</p>



<pre><code>kpartx -v kindle.img</code></pre>



<p>I could then mount the individual partitions on my laptop. I extracted all the files into a folder so I could poke around them and grep them easily. I figured out:</p>



<ul><li>It uses <code>rc.d</code> as its system init system, so there are lots of nice plain text scripts.</li><li>Init level 5 is the “normal” system running the ebook software</li><li>The ebook software is in <code>/opt/amazon</code> and is in Java (I kinda already knew this, but needed a quick refresher).</li><li>There’s a whole load of interesting plain text “diag” scripts for testing.</li><li>There’s a rather nifty <code>wifid</code> daemon for managing the wifi connection: I figured out how to talk to this from the diag scripts.</li><li>You can write to the eink screen from the command line using the <code>/usr/sbin/eips</code> command (<a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Eips">docs here</a>).</li><li>I couldn’t find an obvious “turn off demo mode” switch: it appears the demo mode is a customised build of the Java ebook software.</li><li>The following system services are to do with unsupported features, the ebook software, or talking back to amazon: <code>S50wan S70wand S75phd S81usbnetd S93webreaderd S94browserd S95framework S96boot_finished</code>.</li></ul>



<p>Talking To Wifid</p>



<p>You can use the built in wifid to connect to wifi and manage your wifi profiles. Oh, also, remember many Kindles only support 2.4Ghz wifi when you wonder why it isn’t working 😉</p>



<p><strong>List number of WIFI profiles:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-get-prop com.lab126.wifid profileCount</code></p>



<p><strong>Show contents of a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index=(0)}" | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid profileData</code></p>



<p><strong>Delete a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid deleteProfile WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Create a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo '{essid="WIFIESSID", smethod="wpa2", secured="yes", psk="WIFIPSK"}' | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid createProfile</code></p>



<p>smethod can be one of open,wep,wpa,wpa2 (if you choose open, set secured to “no”)</p>



<p>WIFIPSK is the WIFI PSK as generated with the <code>wpa_passphrase</code> utility (which is actually on the kindle): a normal “wifi passphrase” will not work.</p>



<p><strong>Connect a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid cmConnect WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Show WIFI connection status:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index = (0)}" | lipc-hash-prop -n com.lab126.wifid currentEssid</code></p>



<p>Making Changes To Root</p>



<p>Many of the following instructions need to change the root disk on the kindle. However, by default it is mounted in read only mode, preventing modification. To fix, run this command on the kindle:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot rw</code></pre>



<p>When done, set it back to read only mode to prevent any unwanted changes:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot ro</code></pre>



<p>Installing Dropbear SSH</p>



<p>I wanted to be able to ssh into my kindle, so I needed to install the <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">dropbear</a> ssh daemon. Of course this is an ARM based device, so I either had to compile it myself or find it somewhere. Luckily …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

<p><em>You can listen to <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/6719542d">an audio version of this essay here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Trust me, I <em>tried</em> to make the Clubhouse bear case.</p>
<p>The original title of this post was "Everything Clubhouse Did Right — and Why It Will Fail Anyway". The exercise forced me to list the reasons why it wasn't worth $1 billion - why live conference calls are inferior to existing formats like podcasts and Discord.</p>
<p>When I was done, I went for a walk to think about it. By the time I came back, I had done a complete 180. (Note - <em>this was even before I heard about the Elon event</em>)</p>
<p>I <em>still</em> dislike the Clubhouse experience. I wouldn't recommend it to you. But all the reasons I dislike it are the same reasons it will work:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is exclusive</strong>. You have hoops to jump and gates to open every step of the way. It's iOS only. Invite only. Requires your phone number for no goddamn reason. And once you're through <em>all of that</em> you gain the privilege of being in the voiceless audience hoping senpai will notice your raised hand and puffed up bio.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is ephemeral</strong>. Conversations aren't recorded. Your work doesn't compound and isn't searchable. This is <em>horrible</em> for ROI on your time as a content creator.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is live-only</strong>. If all the convos are happening in Pacific Time and you live in Europe, tough luck. If you came in halfway and have no idea what was said, tough luck. The only way to be fully involved is to turn on mobile notifications and track scheduled chats. Causing more — not less — distraction and work for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse enhances existing privilege</strong>. Because automated recommendations aren't possible, Clubhouse mostly relies on a Twitter-like follow graph. To gain a following you mostly already have to be famous off-platform or well-connected to people who will bring you up on stage ("second-degree famous"). Choosing a <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Status as a Service</a> model (Twitter) over a <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat">Sorting Hat</a> model (TikTok) sacrifices discovery for establishment.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is a terrible listening experience</strong>. There's no audience chat or polling. Obnoxious speakers can dominate the conversation. <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1355817942093496320?s=20">Trolls</a> and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/tiffany-haddish-bullies-doctor-on-clubhouse-covid/">harassment</a> abound. You can't play at 2x or rewind an important part. Podcasts were trending towards better audio and editing, Clubhouse regresses to shitty phone mics with feedback and connection issues. Signal is scarce, noise is rampant.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my original write up I listed the many better offerings in every dimension. Want to listen to interviews with great audio and show notes? Podcasts. Want ultrascalable livestreaming? Twitch. Want livestreamed audio with recording and submitted questions? <a href="https://twitter.com/N8Elliott/status/1355203379392176131?s=20">Capiche</a>. Want to do an audio webinar? Use Zoom with the camera off. Want voice with text chat? Discord. Just want a Clubhouse clone with less friction? <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">Twitter Spaces</a>.</p>
<p>When I was done listing the alternatives, I knew I had made a mistake. They checked more boxes on a feature comparison basis. But social media doesn't work like that. I was trying to be logical in a <em>socio</em>-logical domain.</p>
<p>I had conclusively <em>PROVED</em>, with my big brain and fancy words, how profoundly inferior Clubhouse was. No compounding creator should prefer it, and no self respecting listener should enjoy it, compared to alternatives.</p>
<p>But the majority of people don't work like that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some people are turned off by exclusivity and friction. But <em>most people</em> take it as social proof of something cool.</li>
  <li>Some creators are turned off by ephemerality. But <em>more people</em> will start trying precisely because it's easy and doesn't matter. The Elon Musks and Vlad Tenevs of the world will be less guarded, despite clearly knowing anything they say will be recorded, because <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">the medium is the message</a></em>.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by demands on their time. But <em>most people</em> leave mobile notifications on and the live nature of chats creates some of the most urgent notifications you'll get on your phone, second only to a call from your mother. The synchronicity creates an <em>event</em> — a clear Before and After where you can excitedly gossip and feel superior to people out of the loop. This is a rarity in an everything-async world.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by stacked decks. But <em>most people</em> just want to follow celebrities and experts and aren't interested in the challenging, messy work of finding people on the way up.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by the listening experience. But Clubhouse is <a href="https://www.swyx.io/good-enough/">Good Enough</a>, especially if content is created sooner and in bigger quantity than available anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clubhouse should've died <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse">in July when the VC and Media abuse cases erupted</a>. Instead it came back stronger than ever, standing at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210131175202/https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-hype-about-1-billion-clubhouse-not-so-crazy-2021-1">2 million weekly active users</a>. <strong>If any of these negatives mattered</strong>, the app should have seen extreme churn. Instead, <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/01/24/investing-in-clubhouse/">Andrew Chen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1353393250552270850">Ryan Hoover</a>, and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/gumroad-is-switching-from-zoom-to-clubhouse-34e4b4e5e1">Sahil Lavingia</a> — who do this for a living and have insider knowledge of metrics — value it above $1 billion dollars, six months after it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/05/15/andreessen-horowitz-wins-vc-sweepstakes-to-back-clubhouse-voice-app/?sh=5b8466d56f2a">valued at $100 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong>People. Aren't. Churning.</strong> No matter how much you may hate the app — usage is going <em>up</em>. This is scary and worth taking note. Clubhouse is already showing signs of successful expansion in Asia (read: non-English Clubhouses).</p>
<p>Instagram had 30 million MAUs when Facebook bought it for $1 billion. Whatsapp had 450m for $19 billion. By Whatsapp metrics, Clubhouse is wildly overvalued (lets say it has 10m MAU right now). But audio isn't text. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2019/10/17/the-audio-revolution/">Alex Danco says</a> that texting is a cold medium, while audio is the hottest medium of all. He was mildly wrong — podcasting is still kinda lukewarm — but <strong><em>live, ephemeral</em></strong> audio is so hot you will literally drop everything and stay up late and ignore your partner to go listen to Elon.</p>
<p>Worse is better. The exact reasons you hate Clubhouse — the kind of thing that drives you to read an article like this to the end — are the exact same reasons it is going to win.</p>

							<p><a href="http://www.nathanshipley.com/"><strong>Nathan Shipley</strong></a> is using artificial intelligence to bring historical figures to life, in ways we’ve never seen before. Most of these figures lived far before the advent of photography, so there are no photographic records of them, only paintings and drawings. His clever use of AI is making these figures photorealistic for the first time. And in doing so, he’s breathing unique life into them.</p>

<p>We caught up with Shipley to discuss his latest work, which builds on years of research using GAN, or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative adversarial networks</a>. It’s a growing field of study, and one that will surely impact our lives in the coming years.</p>

<p>Shipley explains some of his education and process for this unique work:</p>


<p><em><strong>“I definitely can’t claim full credit for this process – it is built on code that researchers have generously released.&nbsp; However, I have done my own modifications to that code and am building a custom library of face attributes that I can use to&nbsp;direct the output.&nbsp; My favorite part of these kinds of processes is learning how they work, how to use them, and then how to break them or use them for techniques not originally&nbsp;imagined!”</strong></em></p>


<p>It’s still somewhat surreal to see William Shakespeare or Marie Antoinette as a photorealistic person, and we’re struck by how accurate the models seem to be.</p>

<p>We’re familiar with the notion of ‘deep fakes’, or image creation that is used with the intent of manipulating or tricking a system, but Shipley has utilized this technology on historical paintings, bringing almost an archeological perspective to the science.</p>






<p><strong>“StyleGAN is a kind of machine learning architecture that can be used to “learn” how to create more of a particular kind of image that you show it.&nbsp; For example, if you show it a dataset of images of cats, it will learn to create new images&nbsp;of cats that aren’t direct copies of the input.&nbsp; Properly trained, it can make cats that don’t exist!</strong></p>



<p><strong>I come from a VFX and animation background,&nbsp;so it’s been fascinating&nbsp;to see how images can be created that&nbsp;would previously have been impossible.&nbsp; It’s pretty technical but a really fascinating area to explore!”</strong></p>

<p>Shipley is quick to say these visual experiments aren’t saying <em>“this is what William Shakespeare looked like”</em></p>


<p><strong>“I consider these recreations to be experiments that I am sharing publicly.&nbsp; The AI doesn’t “know” what Shakespeare really looked like, but it’s fascinating to see how this particular combination of variables can come together to give us a glimpse!”</strong></p>

<p>My first proper programming language was C.
It was super confusing, and I wrote some terrible code that didn't really do anything terribly useful.</p>
<p>Along the way, however, I learned a bit about how computers do things, sort of.
I say sort of because <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/267583/why-is-c-still-in-the-category-of-high-level-language" title="If you disagree, please voice your dissent in my comment section">C is a <em>high level language</em></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there are <em>higher-level</em> languages, and those end up being really good for a very wide array of tasks, so I went and learned them, and then I started actually getting things done.
I'm glad I started with C, though, since it gave me an idea of what these other languages must be doing under the hood to accomplish so much with so little code.</p>
<p>Using Scheme, Python, or Javascript, I didn't have to bother with managing the computer's memory allocation manually, and that turned out to be a lot more fun.</p>
<p>At some point a while back, I heard about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust-lang</a>.</p>
<p>What is Rust?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sounds-good-right">Sounds good, right?</h2>
<p>Yea, actually.</p>
<p>I think it's a pretty awesome language.
The problem is, I make my living writing stuff working on web apps, and that means writing Javascript.
That's not a problem, necessarily, but I just don't have much use for a language like Rust.</p>
<p>It definitely seems awesome, and as a lisp aficionado, I love a lot of its high level concepts.
As I recall, Rust even has properly nesting block comments, which I find quite practical.</p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-going-with-this">Where am I going with this?</h2>
<p>Well, I just wanted to clear up that I don't think Rust is a bad language.
I'm not going to criticize <em>Rust</em> in this article, however, I am going to criticize a part of the community surrounding the language.</p>
<p>To be honest, actually, I'm not really sure the people I'm going to criticize are even a part of the community.
At best, they seem to be a part of the fringe.</p>
<p>Who are these people?</p>
<p>They are the people who show up unannounced on your software project's doorstep (probably your issue tracker) and ask the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you considered <em><strong>Rewriting It In Rust</strong></em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="yes-im-starting-a-language-flame-war">Yes, I'm starting a language flame war</h2>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>If you've spent any time at all in a community where programmers hang out, you've probably seen a flame war over which language is best.</p>
<p>I don't know which language is best, though I've argued for Scheme many times because nobody else seems to be doing it.</p>
<p>That being said, I've noticed that this particular subset of the Rust community seems to do this particular thing often enough that it's nearly the only thing that I know about the Rust community.</p>
<p>I've joked about it with friends and coworkers, and sure enough, most of them have witnessed it in the wild.</p>
<p>I believe the first time I saw it was on the (now disabled) <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">cjdns</a> issue tracker.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have the tracker turned on for long enough that I was able to get a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/cjdns-eventually-moving-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="'prevent thread problems' in software that runs on one thread... yea"></p>
<p>It all started and ended pretty quickly.
Some <em>Rustafarian</em> asked a question, and the author (<a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle">@cjdelisle</a>) answered somewhat sarcastically.</p>
<p>Once OP figures out that their brilliant idea is not being taken seriously, they get annoyed and leave.</p>
<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there's more</h2>
<p>Yea, of course it goes on.
I heard it a few more times, laughed about it (oh, this again), and then continued on with my life.</p>
<p>Of course, clearly it happened enough times that I started to notice a trend, because as I mentioned, I've joked about it with people, and they've noticed it too.</p>
<p>So, this morning (<strong>2016-03-22</strong>) I saw <a href="https://github.com/fc00/go-fc00/issues/1">a thread</a> in a repo I'm watching, and there it was again:</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/go-fc00-why-go.jpg" alt="" title="...my actual question was about building a maybe more valuable solution..."></p>
<p>Once again, my friends make some snappy comments.
Pair those with a classic <em>if you want it written why don't you write it</em>, a few more <em>lulz</em> and our <em>Rustacean</em> acquaintance gets annoyed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ok, didn't thought a simple question would attract that much angry trolls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>..and things pretty much die out.</p>
<h2 id="but-then-i-started-thinking">But then I started thinking</h2>
<p>We joked about it on IRC, and a few more people comment that they've also seen this in the wild, and quickly enough we find that we need an acronym because <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em> takes too long to type and so <strong>RIIR</strong> is born.</p>
<p>So, naturally, once an acronym is born, we have a meme, and memes like to spread.
So, naturally, I start digging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who else has been hit by this storm that has been sweeping the web?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="nix">Nix</h3>
<p>Apparently there were a few threads like <a href="http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2015-December/019040.html">this one</a> which went on for a while.
I haven't checked the exact timelines, but since this is a language flame war, I'm sure somebody will leap in to do that research for me.</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/nix-dev-perl-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Rust does this very well, to the point where me enumerating its benefits would be redundant."></p>
<h3 id="tor">Tor</h3>
<p>Yup, Tor, the very large, critical infrastructure that keeps journalists, criminals, schizophrenics, and <del>piracy</del> privacy activists anonymous has been <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11331">asked to rewrite their software</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/rewrite-tor-in-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Writing C code that is safe is super hard (even for exeperienced Tor devs)"></p>
<h2 id="more-still">More still...</h2>
<p>Why not <a href="https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-advantageous-to-rewrite-the-Linux-kernel-in-Rust-when-the-language-is-stable" title="this one isn't on an issue tracker, at least">rewrite the Linux Kernel</a>? I'd love to hear Linus's answer to this.</p>
<p>Then of course there's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11337399">this comprehensive thread</a> on Hacker News covering a bunch of angles on the pros and cons of this meme.</p>
<p>Finally, I stumbled across <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/rewrite-everything-in-rust.html" title="rewrite everytihng in rust">this blog</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being quite new, and certainly newer than the meme itself, this post seems to exemplify many of the talking points extolled by proponents of <strong>RIIR</strong>.</p>
<p>Its title even comes in the form of a call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rewrite Everything In Rust</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so">So...?</h2>
<p>I don't really have more to say on the matter.
I just wrote this much to document a phenomenon I've noticed.</p>
<p>I don't have a comments section, because it ends up being really time consuming to say annoying, opinionated things if you have to answer for the fallout in your comments section.
Instead, I made <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR" title="Rewrite It In Rust">a github repo</a> where you can <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR/issues">file an issue</a> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>voices your own obnoxious opinion</li>
<li>supports my thesis<ul>
<li>super bonus points if you find more github issues asking for Rust rewrites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>refutes my thesis<ul>
<li>super science points if you find that this behaviour is not exhibited disproportionately by Rust users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>links to some project where somebody actually did <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="did-this-post-offend-you">Did this post offend you?</h2>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Talk about it.</p>
<p>Tell your friends.</p>
<p>Good memes die hard.</p>

<p>By Carroll Wainwright and Peter Eckersley<br>
<span>Published on 2019-12-04, on the <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/safelife/">PAI blog</a></span>.</p>
<p><span>The Partnership on AI (PAI) is today releasing SafeLife – a novel reinforcement learning environment that tests the safety of reinforcement learning agents and the algorithms that train them. SafeLife version 1.0 focuses on the problem of avoiding negative side effects—how can we train an agent to do what we want it to do but nothing more? The environment has simple rules, but rich and complex dynamics, and generally gives the agent lots of power to make big changes on its way to completing its goals. A safe agent will only change that which is necessary, but an unsafe agent will often make a big mess of things and not know how to clean it up.</span></p>
<p><span>SafeLife is part of a broader PAI initiative to develop benchmarks for safety, fairness, and other ethical objectives for machine learning systems. Since so much of machine learning is driven, shaped, and measured by </span><a href="https://eff.org/ai/metrics"><span>benchmarks</span></a><span> (and the datasets and environments they are based on), we believe it is essential that those benchmarks come to incorporate safety and ethics goals on a widespread basis, and we’re working to make that happen.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to try out SafeLife for yourself, you can </span><a href="https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/safelife/"><span>download the code</span></a><span> and try playing some of the puzzle levels. If you’d like to see how to create an AI to play SafeLife, additional details about the environment and our initial agent training can be found</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01217">in our paper</a>.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Side Effects</h3>
<p><span>Reinforcement learning agents are rapidly growing in capabilities. They can </span><a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go"><span>beat masters in chess and go</span></a><span>, control robotic hands with enough manual dexterity </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/"><span>to solve a Rubik’s Cube</span></a><span>, and potentially be applied across many domains with </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265"><span>variable and unknown rules</span></a><span>.</span> <span>As reinforcement learning agents start to get deployed in real-world high-stakes scenarios, it is critical to make sure that they operate within appropriate (and often quite strict and intricate) safety constraints. However, the whole point of reinforcement learning is that it can greedily search for novel techniques when solving a problem. </span><b>If we can’t predict what an AI is going to do, how can we predict that it will be safe?</b><span> In practice, reinforcement learning can only be used in the real world in settings where safety is so well understood that constraints can be exactly and correctly codified in advance. </span><span>Other tasks, like safely controlling the behavior of a robot when it is interacting with the world at large, are much more challenging.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the thorniest </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565"><span>problems in AI safety</span></a><span> is learning to avoid negative side effects. Usually, when we give an agent a task, we have something specific in mind that the agent should do. At the same time, we have a huge implicit list of things that the agent should </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> do. When we train a robot to fetch the coffee, we want it to efficiently brew the tastiest cup possible. But we also do not want the robot to step on the cat (even if it’s in the way), or rob the local grocer (even if it’s cheaper than paying), or crash the stock market (even if it would bring down the price of beans). Specifying all the things that the robot should not do is a near impossible task; we just want our delicious cup of coffee, nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span>Difficult though this problem may be, there has been some promising research on how to avoid side effects in general. The </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"><span>proposed</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09725"><span>techniques</span></a><span> have been tested on hand-crafted Sokoban-style environments which have demonstrated both the problem and the ways in which naive solutions may fail. However, these environments are very small; they can easily be overfit, and the “effects” tend to be straightforward and isolated. </span><b>Until now, there has been no rich environment with difficult goals in which effects are both necessary and required at different scales. SafeLife aims to fill this gap.</b></p>
<h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/pattern-demo.gif"></p><p>Figure 1. Creating complex patterns in SafeLife.</p>
</div>
<p><span>SafeLife is based on </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"><span>Conway’s Game of Life</span></a><span>, a set of rules for cellular automata on an infinite two-dimensional grid. In Conway’s Game of Life, every cell on the grid is either “alive” or “dead”. At each time step, the entire grid is updated. Any living cell with fewer than two or more than three living neighbors dies, and any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes alive. All other cells retain their previous state. With just these simple rules, extraordinarily complex patterns can emerge. Some patterns will be static—they won’t change between time steps. Other patterns will oscillate between two, three, </span><a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Jason%27s_p156"><span>or more</span></a><span> states. Gliders and spaceships travel across the grid, while guns and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffer_train"><span>puffers</span></a><span> can produce never-ending streams of new patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite its name, Conway’s Game of Life is not actually a game—there are no players, and there are no choices to be made. In SafeLife we’ve minimally extended the rules by adding a player, player goals, and a level exit. At each time step, the player can choose to move one space along the board, create a new life cell in an adjacent space, or destroy a cell in an adjacent space. By judiciously creating and destroying life cells, the player can build up quite complicated patterns (as seen above!). By matching these patterns to goal cells, the player earns points and eventually opens the exit to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span>We add a few more cell types to allow richer dynamics. There are indestructible walls and trees, movable crates, and spawning cells that are capable of generating never-ending streams of new random patterns. Cells also come in different colors. Some colors, like green and yellow, are neutral and should be left alone by safe agents, while red cells denote unwanted patterns which yield rewards when removed.</span></p>
<h3>Agent behaviors and benchmark levels</h3>
<p><span>We trained agents on five different tasks: building and removing patterns on initially static boards, building and removing patterns on dynamic boards, and navigating across maze-like boards. All of the training levels were randomly generated, and agent performance was graded on a set of 100 fixed benchmark levels for each task.</span></p>
<p><span>In order to form a baseline, we trained agents with </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347"><span>proximal policy optimization</span></a><span>,</span><span> both with and without a simple side effect impact penalty. </span><span>The penalty we chose simply punishes the agent every time a cell changes away from its starting state. This is not a good way to measure side effects! It is, however, an </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> way to measure side effects, and helps illustrate the shortcomings of side effect impact penalties more generally.</span></p>
<h5>Agents in Static Environments</h5>
<p><span>A static environment is the easiest environment in which one can measure side effects. Since the environment doesn’t change without agent input, </span><i><span>any</span></i><span> change in the environment must be due to agent behavior. The agent is the cause of every effect. Our simple side effect impact penalty performs quite well here.</span></p>
<p><span>When agents are trained without an impact penalty they tend to make a big mess.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-append-still-013_p0.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-still-003_p0.gif"></p><p>Figure 2. Left: an unsafe agent builds new patterns while disrupting existing ones. Right: an unsafe agent destroys red patterns along with much of the rest of the level.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 2, the image on the left shows a pattern-building agent that has learned how to construct stable 2-by-2 blocks that it can place on top of goal cells. The agent has not, however, learned to do so without disrupting nearby green patterns. Once the green pattern has been removed, the agent can more easily make its own pattern in its place.</span></p>
<p><span>Likewise, the image on the right in Figure 2 shows a pattern-destroying agent that has learned that the easiest way to remove red cells is to disrupt </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> cells. Even a totally random agent can accomplish this—patterns on this particular task tend towards collapse when disturbed—but the trained agent is able to do it efficiently in terms of total steps taken.</span></p>
<p><span>Applying an impact penalty yields quite different behavior.</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-append-still-013_p1.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-still-003_p1.gif"></p><p>Figure 3. Left: a safe agent builds new patterns, but is too cautious to complete its goals. Right: a safe agent successfully removes red patterns without disrupting anything else.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 3, the image on the left illustrates how the pattern-building agent is now too cautious to disrupt the green pattern. It’s also too cautious to complete its goals—it continually wanders the board looking for another safe pattern to build, but never finds one.</span></p>
<p><span>In SafeLife, as in life, destroying something (even safely) is much easier than building it, and the pattern-destroying agent with an impact penalty (Figure 3, right) performs much better than the one without the penalty. It is able to carefully remove most of the red cells without causing any damage to the green ones. However, it’s not able to remove </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> of the red cells, and it completes the level much more slowly than its unsafe peer. Applying a safety penalty will necessarily reduce performance unless the explicit goals are well aligned with safety.</span></p>
<h5>Agents in Dynamic Environments</h5>
<p><span>Side effects are much more difficult to disentangle in dynamic environments. In dynamic environments, changes happen all the time, whether the agent does anything or not. Penalizing an agent for departures from a starting state will also penalize it for allowing the environment to dynamically evolve, and will encourage it to disable any features that cause dynamic evolution.</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-spawn-019_p0.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-spawn-019_p0.5.gif"></p><p>Figure 4. Left: an unsafe agent predictably ignores the chaotic region and focuses on its goals. Right: in its effort to avoid side effects, an overzealous agent destroys dynamic parts of the level.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 4, the image on the left shows an agent trained without an impact penalty. This unsafe agent ignores the stochastic yellow pattern and quickly destroys the red pattern and exits the level. The image on the right shows the effects of an agent with a small impact penalty. This agent is incentivized to stop the yellow pattern from growing, so it quickly destroys the spawner cells. Only then does it move on to the red cells, but it doesn’t manage to remove them safely, as its training has taught it to focus more on the …</span></p></div></div>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>For the last four years, a small team at Popgun has been studying the application of deep learning to music analysis
and generation. This research has culminated in the release of <a href="https://splashpro.popgun.ai/">Splash Pro</a> - a free, AI-powered plugin 
for Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). With the release of this blog, we hope to provide an accessible introduction to 
deep learning with music, by explaining some core projects we have worked on.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this post I want to describe the design of a model for expressive piano synthesis. The model, 
which we call ‘BeatNet’, is capable of analysing a piano performance and generating new pieces that imitate the 
original playing style. Before I get into the technical workings, here are a few samples generated by BeatNet:</p>

<p><strong>In the style of “Yiruma - River Flows In You”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Chopin - Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Errol Garner - Misty”*</strong>
</p>





<p>BeatNet is able to replicate many of the characteristics present in human piano performances, albeit with
some weaknesses and limitations that I will address. To explain how this model works, I have split the 
remainder of the blog into two sections. Part I will discuss musical representations, while Part II will explore the 
model design and showcase more of its capabilities.</p>

<p><span>
*Note: BeatNet does not model sustain pedal events. Sustain was manually added to this piece.
</span></p>

<h2 id="part-i---representations-of-music">Part I - Representations of Music</h2>

<p>In designing a model for music generation, it is critical to choose an appropriate representation. This choice
determines which data can be faithfully encoded, the modelling techniques that are available, and the efficacy of the 
overall system. For this reason, I have decided to begin with a brief explanation of some common musical 
representations. If this all feels familiar to you, feel free to skip ahead to part II.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>When we talk about audio in machine learning, we are typically referring to an array of time-domain samples. These
samples are a digital approximation to the physical sound pressure wave. The quality of this approximation is
determined by the sample rate and the bit-depth (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a>). In 
research, it is common to see sample rates of 16-22kHz. However, to capture the full range of human audible frequencies,
most HiFi applications (e.g. music, podcasts, etc) use rates of around 44kHz 
(see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist Theorem</a>).</p>

<p>Because of its high dimensionality, modelling raw audio is extremely challenging. For a generative model to 
reproduce audio structure on a timescale of a few seconds, it must capture the relationships between tens of 
thousands of samples. While it is becoming increasingly feasible to do this (see <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>), there are more 
efficient ways to encode piano performances.</p>

<p>Note: For an example of music modelling directly in the audio domain, 
see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/">OpenAI’s Jukebox</a> <a href="#citation-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="midi">MIDI</h3>

<p>MIDI is a technical standard allowing electronic instruments and computers to communicate. It comprises
a sequence of ‘messages’, each describing a particular musical event or instruction. Instructions relating to the 
note timings, pitch and loudness (i.e. velocity) can be transmitted and stored. For example, a piano performance 
encoded as MIDI is a record of which notes were pressed, how forcefully and at what time.</p>

<p>To convert a MIDI file back into listenable audio, a piece of software replays these instructions and
synthesizes the relevant notes. MIDI does not encode acoustic information, such as the instrument sound or the recording
environment. For this reason it is drastically more efficient than audio, and it is a good starting point for our 
exploration.</p>

<p>When working with MIDI we use the terrific <a href="https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi">PrettyMIDI</a> library by Colin Raffel. This abstracts away many
complexities of the raw format. See Colin Raffel’s <a href="https://colinraffel.com/publications/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for
a more in-depth explanation of the MIDI file format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 - Für Elise in PrettyMIDI Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>Note(start=0.000000, end=0.305000, pitch=76, velocity=67)
Note(start=0.300000, end=0.605000, pitch=75, velocity=63)
Note(start=0.600000, end=0.905000, pitch=76, velocity=74)
Note(start=0.900000, end=1.205000, pitch=75, velocity=71)
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how succinctly we can represent Für Elise this way, and consider that the equivalent audio section 
contains approximately 50k samples (for a 44kHz recording).</p>

<h3 id="piano-roll">Piano Roll</h3>

<p>This will look familiar to anyone who has used a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as GarageBand or Ableton.
The vertical axis denotes pitch, and the horizontal axis denotes time. The velocity of each note is encoded
by its magnitude. As well as providing an intuitive way to visualize MIDI, piano roll has some interesting 
properties for machine learning.</p>

<p>For example, consider the effect of raising the song’s pitch by one semitone, or delaying its onset by a few seconds. 
These transpositions preserve the spatial structure of the piano roll. When designing a model we can exploit this 
property by applying 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Early experiments at Popgun tried exactly
this, as did <a href="https://youtu.be/nA3YOFUCn4U?t=597">this project</a> using PixelCNN. However, there are some serious drawbacks to this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 - Für Elise in Piano Roll Format</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://popgun-labs.github.io/ml-blog/assets/images/piano_roll_fur_elise_crop.png" alt="Für Elise - Piano Roll"></p>

<p>A typical song encoded as piano roll is incredibly sparse: nearly all entries are zero. 
Naively applying a CNN wastes a large amount of computation on entirely empty regions. It is also difficult
to choose a suitable resolution for the time axis. If the original data is quantised, such that each note aligns
perfectly with a uniform musical grid, we can choose the resolution based on the quantisation strength. However,
this breaks down for expressive piano performances, where natural variations in timing are critical to the musicality.</p>

<p>Note: Many works have tried to model piano roll, using a broad range of neural net architectures. For those interested 
to learn more, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6392">this paper</a> is a good starting point <a href="#citation-16">[16]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="time-shift-format">Time-Shift Format</h3>

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/blog/">Google Magenta</a> released a model called Performance RNN <a href="#citation-3">[3]</a>, which demonstrated the ability 
to model expressive piano performances with high fidelity. The key innovation was a new format that is highly 
suited to this task. For reasons that will become apparent, we refer to this “performance representation” simply as 
“time-shift”. Like MIDI, time-shift encodes music with a sequence of discrete musical events. What sets it apart is 
the unique way it encodes the progression of time. Instead of representing time along a specific axis (piano roll), 
or as a property of each individual note (MIDI), in time-shift there is a specific event that indicates the 
advancement of the piece.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 - Für Elise in Time-Shift Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>272 - Set Velocity = 64
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
271 - Set Velocity = 60
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
203 - Turn Off MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
274 - Set Velocity = 72
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
273 - Set Velocity = 68
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one-dimensional sequence of tokens is similar to the encodings used in language models.
This means that modern advances in NLP (e.g. ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a>, Transformers <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a>) can be 
readily applied to the time-shift format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4 - An Explanation of the Time-Shift Events</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 - 127: Note on events    
128 - 255: Note off events    
256 - 287: 32 velocity change events   
288 - 387: 100 quantized time-shift values (10ms -&gt; 1000ms)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: We have not accounted for sustain pedal events, however it might be interesting to incorporate them
in future work.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii---beatnet-a-convolutional-model-for-piano-music">Part II - BeatNet: A Convolutional Model for Piano Music</h2>

<p>In 2016, researchers at Google’s DeepMind lab released the now-famous WaveNet paper <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>. The core 
insight was that 1D convolutions could produce efficient sequence models, by eliminating the need for expensive 
recurrent computations during training. The efficacy was proven with a 
<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio">demo</a> of raw audio generation. The 
publication of ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a> shortly afterwards, extended this idea to the domain of natural language 
processing.</p>

<p>Inspired by this work, Popgun developed its own ByteNet model for symbolic piano music. We refer to this work as
“BeatNet”. The choice to use ByteNet over traditionally dominant RNNs was motivated by a few factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ability to capture long-term dependencies over hundreds or thousands of tokens</li>
  <li>Fast training</li>
  <li>Hype. WaveNet and ByteNet were the first papers to threaten the dominance of RNNs, before Transformer based
architectures <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a> exploded in popularity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data-collection-and-processing">Data Collection and Processing</h3>

<p>We curated a MIDI dataset by drawing from a number of online sources. One key source was the
<a href="http://www.piano-e-competition.com/">Yamaha e-Piano Competition Dataset</a>, consisting of jazz 
and classical music performances. Another source was the <a href="https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/">Lakh MIDI Dataset</a>, 
which contains a broader range of genres, including many contemporary pieces.</p>

<p>To create a model which generates highly expressive performances, we processed the data to filter out ‘low quality’ 
items. Anyone who has worked with MIDI datasets will appreciate that many songs sound ‘bad’.
This raises some difficult problems: What is musical quality? How can we account for subjective preferences? 
Are some songs so weird we can confidently deem them ‘not musical’? Suffice to say, these problems are beyond
the scope of this post.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our working solution can be summarised as this: An engineer listened to some data items, in each case 
proclaiming “Yep, this sounds musical” or “Nope, I don’t like it”. In the process, they developed automated heuristics
to filter unwanted items, biasing the dataset towards songs that are subjectively ‘musical’. In the future it would be 
interesting to crowd-source these assessments, or to devise heuristics based on music theory instead.</p>

        <p>The Raspberry Pi is capable of running the NoSQL database Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Either use <a href="https://schneefux.xyz/tech/raspberrypi-bootstrapping/">Arch Linux ARM</a> or the Raspbian Lite (Stretch) image and add the Elasticsearch apt repository. The packages are cross platform, but there are no official arm packages in the debian repository, so you need to force <code>arch=amd64</code>:</p>
<pre><code>deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/5.x/debian stable main
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Mount a btrfs formatted USB stick to <code>/var/lib/elasticsearch</code> using <code>nodatacow,noatime,nobarrier</code>. COW should always be disabled for directories with database files.</li>
<li>Install <code>elasticsearch kibana</code> and NodeJS (on ArchLinux with Kibana 5.5, you need <code>nodejs-lts-boron</code>).</li>
<li>Set the Elastic jvm minimum/maximum heap size to 1/2 of your Pi’s RAM. The rest will be used by Elastic’s Lucene backend.</li>
<li>Disable system call filter checks on startup with <code>bootstrap.system_call_filter: false</code> because the Raspberry Pi does not support JNI, which Elastic tries to import in order to run the checks.</li>
<li>Increase ping timeouts. The Raspberry Pi needs several minutes to start Elasticsearch and will timeout often. <code>discovery.zen.ping_timeout: 60</code></li>
<li>Set up clustering: specify a cluster name, add a few <code>discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts</code> and most importantly increase <code>discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes</code> to the minimum number of nodes / 2 + 1. The initial discovery will take a long time with timeouts from the Raspberry Pis in the cluster and increasing the minimum number of nodes will prevent the “split brain” where multiple Raspberry Pis elect themselves at masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having tested an Elasticsearch cluster with a 20G index across 3 Raspberry Pi nodes and my laptop, I cannot recommend it. Performance was awful, syncing data took hours, and <a href="https://schneefux.xyz/tech/scaling-elasticsearch/">removing the Pis from the cluster again</a> was a pain.</p>

<div>
<p>Data Governance seeks to bring order to the chaos that emerges as organisations turn to data to make decisions. To many, the term “data” is synonymous with “fact”, forgetting the fact that data requires context to be properly interpreted. Context varies by department, business unit across teams and even within teams, leading to misinterpretation of data and increasing the risk that data is misrepresented. Data Governance helps to define rules, processes and policies for how data is collected, managed to ensure that it can be consistently interpreted and applied to advanced analytics, machine learning and automation. </p>
<p>Analytics platforms like PowerBI, Tableau and Looker put data in the hands of employees and promise better decisions based on real data. But what happens when a colleagues number is different from yours? Or when people don’t know which version of a dashboard to view? Or when you discover the “Sales metric” you have been making decisions on doesn’t actually include all the things you thought it does?</p>
<p>Machine Learning has the capability to transform all aspects of business, from recommending products to your customers, optimising call routing in your call centre through to segmenting marketing messages. As organisations become more reliant on these technologies, they are more likely to incorporate them deeper into their processes leaving them vulnerable to prickly edge cases. Machine learning fails are already well-publicised, from<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G" rel="nofollow"> sexist recruitment AI at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/geraldmellor/status/712880710328139776?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Microsoft’s AI Twitter Bot “Tay” who lasted less than 24 hours before going full racist.</a></p>
<p>Automation, especially when combined with Machine Learning makes organisations more efficient and more scalable. Marketing Automation provides marketers with super-powers to deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. However, when automation fails (often due to errors in data), the problems are amplified – as one mistake can set off a chain of events that can destroy organisations.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p>To help illustrate the importance of Data Governance, we will use a fictional company, which has run into an equally fictional set of challenges. Forrest Corp, is an online book retailer with approximately 100 staff, based in Melbourne, Australia. As with many organisations of this size, Forest Corp has functional teams responsible for Marketing, Finance, Technology, Customer Service and Operations. Forrest Corp has been wildly successful, with sales exploding throughout COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>The executive team is very displeased that gross margins and profitability have deteriorated sharply, and that their personal (managed) Instagram feeds are blowing up with negative messages. They want answers! In speaking with leaders from different teams, they receive mixed messages:</p>
<ul><li>Marketing is excited to show a 10% increase in sales due to a Social Media Influencer campaign and finds it difficult to believe things are as bad as they are made out to be</li><li>Finance says sales are flat, with rising inventories, shipping costs and customer retention costs hurting margins and profitability</li><li>Customer service is inundated with complaints, but they feel they have it under control using their existing policies and procedures</li><li>Operations confirm the increase in sales, but their team is overworked in dealing with the influx of sales and a large number of returns.</li></ul>
<p>An analysis by an external analytics consultancy begins to unravel the story:</p>
<ul><li>The Marketing team recently established a new Social Media Influencer program, enabling influencers to sign up to earn referral commissions on books they recommend. </li><li>A very popular Social Media Influencer has recommended a particular book to their large follower base</li><li>The rapid increase in sales of the book have impacted the company’s recommendation model, leading to it being recommended to a much wider audience of customers</li><li>It turns out that the Social Media Influencer has misrepresented the book leading to a high rate of return from dissatisfied customers</li><li>In order to placate angry customers, customer Service follows its procedure of sending gifts to aggrieved customers, as recommended by their recommendation engine.</li><li>The gifts only inflame the situation, infuriated customers are often sent the same book as they initially returned.</li></ul>
<p>How could this all happen?</p>
<h2 id="Data-Governance">A failure of <span>Data Governance</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://datagovernance.com/">Data Governance Institute</a> defines data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.”</p>
<p>Data governance is often formally practised in large organizations, but many of the concepts are applicable to all organisations seeking to utilise data in decision making.</p>
<p>In Forest Corp’s case, a series of failures in the way it collects, manages and utilizes data led to the cascading problems illustrated above.</p>
<h2 id="Data-Quality">Data Quality</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="372" src="https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-1024x372.png" alt="" srcset="https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-1024x372.png 1024w, https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Data Quality Foundations <a href="https://profisee.com/data-quality-what-why-how-who/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Image credit</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Data quality is the foundation for all analytics and machine learning. As organisations seek to make more decisions on the basis of data, there is a real risk that decisions can be made incorrectly if the data underpinning them is incorrect, incomplete or inconsistent.</p>
<p>A key failure for Forest Corp’s marketing team was in its lack of screening of Influencer’s past histories. Social Media Influencers could sign up for their affiliate program easily, with critical pieces of information collected without any verification.</p>
<p>In the Forest Corp example, when the Marketing team’s analytics began showing the success of one affiliate code they immediately looked up the influencer behind it. Unfortunately, the URLs behind the profile were unusable. No data was supplied for their Twitter and Facebook handles, and their supplied Instagram handle didn’t actually exist. While contact information was provided, emails and phone calls went unanswered. So the Marketing Team was faced with a challenging scenario – their Social Media Influencer program is clearly generating sales but they are blind as to the content triggering it or the person behind it.</p>
<p>If data is captured incorrectly, it is often difficult or impossible to correct it. Worst of all though is that it’s only when an organisation <em>really</em> needs high-quality data that they realise it was never collected properly. In the Forrest Corp example, they were blind to a massive spike in sales attributable to a single affiliate without any way to tie it back to.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Quality-Recommendations">Data Quality Governance Recommendations</h3>
<h4 id="Incentivise-data-quality-at-the-point-of-collection">Incentivise data quality at the point of collection</h4>
<p>Digging deeper into the sign-up process for affiliates, it was discovered that the affiliate systems were built quickly following a mandate from the Executive Team to get the system up and running prior to a major holiday. Additionally, the Marketing Manager’s key KPI’s for the quarter were the number of onboarded affiliates, as well as the sales volume generated by affiliates. The problems with the affiliate signup process was a product of these incentives.</p>
<p>The time pressure to build the onboarding system meant that the initial design could not be implemented in its entirety. As Product Owner, the Marketing Manager had to prioritize which features would make the initial version, and which would be delayed to a future version. Automated verification of affiliates was seen as a large piece of work and thought to add friction to the signup process potentially hurting the Marketing Managers KPIs. It was therefore easy for the Marketing Manager to de-prioritise this feature of the onboarding system.</p>

<ul><li>Key Performance Indicators that create disincentives for data quality should be avoided.</li><li>Analyse and understand the unintended consequences of performance metrics on data quality</li><li>Incorporate data quality metrics into KPI’s for Product Owners whos products involve data capture</li></ul>
<h4 id="Projects-that-involve-data-collection-require-oversight-and-guidance,-and-periodic-review">Projects that involve data collection require oversight and guidance, and periodic review</h4>
<p>Without a process of oversight in how data was captured, the Marketing Manager was free to make decisions that ultimately caused the misleading Influencer to speak fraudulently on behalf of their organisation. However, the Marketing Manager is rightly focussed on Marketing, not issues of Data Governance. An organisation can’t and shouldn’t expect all its managers to be Data Governance experts.</p>

<ul><li>A Data Governance Council should provide advice on issues relating to how projects are implemented and the potential costs and risks of different implementations.</li><li>Data quality metrics should be established with any project that involves data capture</li><li>A Data Governance Council should periodically review or audit key systems to see how they are actually being used and assess the quality of the data they capture.</li></ul>

<p>Equally, in designing the affiliate sign-up form, the Marketing Team failed to understand the pressures on Social Media Influencers. One of these pressures is the need to sign up to a <em>lot</em> of affiliate programs, and the fact that time spent signing up to affiliate programs is time not spent building their brand and following. The Forrest Corp Affiliate Signup process, while failing to verify key information, also asked for a lot of information much of which seemed fairly unimportant to them getting paid. Therefore a lot of fields were left blank, even critical ones.</p>
<h5 id="Guiding-principles-for-designing-data-capture-systems">Guiding principles for designing data capture systems</h5>
<p>Data entry is often the least enjoyable aspect of a process., but is of critical importance. Systems that collect data need to be user friendly and easy to use. Here are a few principles:</p>
<ul><li>Make use of “pick lists” or “autocomplete” to make it easy to link data</li><li>Make it easy to identify existing entities to reduce the risk of creating duplicate entries</li><li>Avoid requiring too many fields, or …</li></ul></div></div></div></div></article></div>

                    <p>Last week started with the ambitious goal of adding 10 recipes from various cookbooks into Hey Chef. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to "eat my own dog food" and test the Add Ingredient UI.</p><p>Well, 2 recipes and 3 pages of notes later, I gave up.</p><h2 id="mistakes-i-ve-made-a-few">Mistakes, I've made a few</h2><p>I thought if I covered quantity, measurement and ingredient names I could add <em>most</em> recipes to the app. It turns out, even these simple pieces of information can have hidden gotchas.</p><p>I made assumptions such as "ingredients always have a quantity and measurement" &nbsp;<em>(spoiler: they don't) and</em> jumped from design to development without user testing.</p><p>If I wanted to deliver a great user experience, I'd have to dive deep on ingredients and find issues with my UI <em>before </em>development. Enter prototyping.</p><h2 id="what-s-a-prototype">What's a prototype?</h2><p>Prototypes are lightweight versions of your product, designed to highlight usability and flow issues prior to development. Although they <em>can</em> involve code, they typically range from sketches on paper to interactive design files. Development is expensive and prototyping saves time by discovering problems early in the design process.</p><h2 id="add-ingredient-v2">Add Ingredient v2</h2><p>I made this interactive prototype and set myself a new goal of "share it with 5 users and find problems early."</p><p>The clip below is of the design <em>after</em> feedback, but I'll go into the issues I discovered in my user testing sessions and why ingredients aren't as simple as the seem.</p><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/HeyChefAddIngredient.gif" alt=""><figcaption>New and improved Add Ingredient UI. This prototype is purposely designed in grey scale to focus on interactions over design.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ingredients-are-complicated">Ingredients are complicated</h2><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of how an ingredient sentence can quickly become more complex.</figcaption></figure><p>Ingredients can range from a simple list of names and measurements to complex sentences containing descriptions, alternatives and preparation advice. They aren't always consistent in their sentence structure, and can vary wildly from source to source.</p><p>I've found 4 main categories of information that can be included in ingredient lists.</p><h3 id="quantity">Quantity</h3><blockquote><em>extra virgin olive oil</em></blockquote><p>Ingredients always have a quantity, until they don't. Sometimes recipes will just say "olive oil." As in, olive oil will be used at some point, in some quantity but I'm not telling you how much.</p><p>The strange thing is, the recipe will usually say in the method somewhere to add "1 tablespoon of olive oil." Just put that in the ingredients then!</p><p>I've decided that Hey Chef will always require a quantity. It'll make development of features like "Shopping Lists" easier and keep data consistent. </p><h3 id="not-every-ingredient-has-a-measurement">Not every ingredient has a measurement</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Old UI vs New Design. User can add extra pieces information about their ingredient. Measurements and Preparations are the current options, but more on that later.</figcaption></figure><p>Ingredients are often written without a measurement. For example, "4 spring onions." That's ok spring onions, you're good just the way you are.</p><p>In the old UI, the user always had to add a measurement, otherwise the "Add Ingredient" button would be disabled. Now, the user can just tap "Done" and save the ingredient without one.</p><p>I did have issues in user testing with people not <em>always</em> seeing the option to add a measurement, so I might have to revisit that UI in future.</p><h3 id="custom-measurements">Custom Measurements</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Smart measurement suggestions for "bacon." Suggestions change depending on the ingredient added.</figcaption></figure><p>Certain foods have measurements specifically associated with them. You can't have a knob of bacon but you can have a knob of butter.</p><p>I've added a "smart toolbar" above the keyboard that shows measurement suggestions based on the ingredient added.</p><p>Originally, the user could only select from the suggested measurements, but after user testing I discovered people wanted to type. Now, the suggestions will update as the user types and if the app can't find it, the user can add their own custom measurement.</p><h3 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h3><blockquote><em>"120g of <strong>firm</strong> white fish", "3 <strong>mixed-colour</strong> peppers", "1-2 <strong>fresh</strong> red chillies"</em></blockquote><p>These are words that aren't the ingredient but describe something about them. I include colour in the ingredient name and don't consider it a description. For example, "red onion" is an ingredient - it's not an onion that is red.</p><p>They're useful, but I'll add them later in Add Ingredient v3, the app is still usable without descriptions.</p><h3 id="preparation-info">Preparation Info</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An Ingredient can have common preparation advice specific to itself. The above is an example for "rice." Hey Chef will auto suggest these depending on the ingredient.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>"2 red onions, <strong>diced</strong>", "1 cup rice, <strong>washed</strong> and <strong>drained</strong>"</em></blockquote><p>Recipes will often describe how an ingredient should be prepared in the ingredient section instead of the method. When this happens, the method <em>usually</em> has vague steps like "sweat the onion in the frying pan."</p><p>I don't want someone chucking a whole onion in a frying pan because I didn't add preparation information. I'm kidding, but recipes wouldn't be useable without it.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The top 3 are solved and descriptions are a later problem.</figcaption></figure><p>Now that I have an "Add Ingredient" experience I'm happy with, I'm going to write it in code over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>I've found blog posts take considerably longer to write than I originally thought, so I'm aiming to do 2-3 week cycles of development, design and user research followed by a cycle of writing and marketing.</p><p>If I don't write as frequently, that's why - It's not that there isn't progress being made.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-find-new-recipes">How do you find new recipes?</h3><p>In my user testing sessions I asked the participants questions on how they researched new recipes, did their shopping and daily cooking habits. I found some fascinating insights that are going to change the priorities of Hey Chef, but that's for next time... 😉 </p><p>Yep, a cliffhanger 🧗‍♀️</p><p>👋</p>
