  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a mining town. Once upon a time there was a mine, and the mine was the largest employer in the town. They mined copper ore and sold it on the global market. This brought money into the town, which sprouted a restaurant, real estate broker, doctor’s office, and church. Although those people weren’t employed by the mine, they got enough customers from the miners, who fundamentally got money from outside the town.</p>

<p>But eventually the mine dried up. The miners lost their jobs, since the town was no longer bringing in enough money to pay them. The doctor, realtor, and waiter were still employed, as their “mines” didn’t dry up. But they did, as they were really just mining the miners. The town persisted for a bit, passing the same money around in a circle. But with each pass, there was a transaction fee. And there were still things like food, which needed to be imported into the town.</p>

<p>The town went broke, died, and became a ghost town.</p>

<hr>
<p><br>
<b>All jobs can be broken down into one of three groups.</b></p>

<p>The first(constant) is the shoeshiners, bank tellers, politicians, retail workers, clergy, social media managers, lawyers, and the rest of the service industry. An economy made up of only these people wouldn’t work. Imagine a town without imports and exports comprised of only this class of people. Considering every transaction always has a fee, regardless of what this town started with, they would always end up going broke.</p>

<p>So where does money come from? There’s a literal answer to this question, but that’s not what I want to explore. I mean money in a more abstract sense, perhaps more like wealth or value.</p>

<p>The second(linear) group produces “money” linearly. This group includes farmers, miners, and manufacturers. They create value by the ton, bushel, carton, or barrel, a ton of ore mined, a barrel of oil extracted, a bushel of apples grown. This is the only group that could sustain an economy by itself.</p>

<p>The third(exponential) group seeks efficiency improvements for the second. This group includes scientists and engineers. The scientist who genetically engineers crops to get 30% more yield per acre. The engineer who replaces a ox drawn plow with a tractor drawn megaplow. This group can’t sustain an economy alone, but mixing a few of them in with the second group yields much higher per capita money creation.</p>

<p><img src="https://geohot.github.io/blog/assets/images/ourworldindata_share-working-in-agriculture-since-1300.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Most people used to unquestionly be in the second group. The third group has this exponential effect, where in the beginning they do very little, but because they build on the previous successes of the group in a way the other groups don’t, they eventually come to be the driving force of society. Today, although we aren’t quite there yet, it is easy to imagine a few farmers farming all the land, extending their reach with automation and sensors. Or even, no farmers, just machines. And more machines to fix the machines. But the machines would still be in group 2. Group 2 is the basis of any economy.</p>

<p>I set about classifing the top 30 jobs (2/3rds of the workforce, minor level classification from bls.gov) in the US into the three groups, and realized I should break group 1 down further for more clarity. The top 4 jobs consist of just moving stuff around, a clearly group 1 activity!</p>

<p>Breaking down group 1 into 3 subgroups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1M: movers of stuff (waiters, retail, clerks, drivers, bankers)</li>
  <li>1E: fighters of entropy (maids, doctors, nurses)</li>
  <li>1B: people who tell other people what to do. “bosses” of various sorts (management, executives, specialists, “finance”, sales, admins)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found teachers somewhat hard to classify as well, assuming education works, they are group 2, producing more productive people, like a tractor maker. If education is daycare, they are group 1. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and included them in group 2.</p>

<p>And surely not all “Computer Occupations” are group 3, but that’s how it’s broken down.</p>

<p><img src="https://geohot.github.io/blog/assets/images/job_chart_percent.png" alt="image">
<img src="https://geohot.github.io/blog/assets/images/job_chart_class.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I would like to dive into this further, as the categories used from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were rather crude. You can dive even deeper than minor categories. I’d also like to see this analysis done for China, as perhaps this is a US specific problem that only predicts the decline of the US.</p>

<p>But this makes my point, that group 1 jobs have been growing at the expense of group 2. They are now 73% of US jobs! Group 1 jobs do not contribute to the money creation as a whole, and it’s concerning to consider what will happen if this trend continues. We cannot have a worldwide economy of group 1 jobs, as just like the town, the whole world would end up going broke.</p>

        <p>
          April 21, 2020

            ☼ <a href="https://tyler.kim/tagged/life">life</a>
            ☼ <a href="https://tyler.kim/tagged/roka">roka</a>
        </p>

        
<p>I’m an occasional on-call operator for my battalion, assisting the on-call commander and staffing the control room from 16:00 in the afternoon until 08:30 the next morning on weekdays. Most of the work is answering and making calls, updating documents, and making sure that nothing is out of the ordinary. It’s not that difficult, just tiring as there is a lot of stuff to follow and pay attention to through the night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on-call on Friday, the 10th, and for 24 hours last Wednesday (not the usual shift), starting from 08:30 to the next 08:30 since it was the legislative election day in Korea. I wrote most of this post over those two shifts to share how I personally am being on-call.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little past 2300 is when I try to find some peace. I usually make myself a cup of coffee, and it doesn’t take long to feel the caffeine flowing through my bloodstream. I’m exhausted. It’s been many hours since I started my shift, and I have nine hours to go. No shift goes without a hectic evening with lots of random situations to handle, and they are usually followed by a series of paperwork.</p>
<p>I sit in front of a bunch of monitors and tactical comms equipment in bad posture, and the chair predates the concept of ergonomics. Meanwhile my feet are trapped in my airtight combat boots and they are begging to take a breath. In addition, no matter how much water I drink, my mouth is dry the whole time. It’s probably from all the sugar-intakes from snacking. It’s a similar feeling to a tiring second day at a college hackathon - constant snack intakes and sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Around midnight, after I’m finished with all the paperwork that needs to be done by the morning, is a good time to seek solace in a cup ramen. It’s hard to convey the exact late-night-cup-ramen sentiment, but the hot soup warms you up in a way no others can console you in this late time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have books with me so that I can read whenever I can. Late in the night especially after a ramen session is usually a good time to read. Every time I try to read in the evening or during the day, I either get a disruptive phone call or a situation, and they make me re-read the same page multiple times. It gets annoying after a couple of tries.</p>
<p>When I tried to read on the past few shifts, I faced some sad ironies. I brought <em>Why We Sleep</em> to my first shift. Reading about the importance of sleep while not being able to sleep was quite saddening, so I stopped after a few pages in. At least I learned why I feel wide awake towards the end of my shift (in the morning), and why I have difficulties sleeping after my shift despite being tired as hell. Now I’m reading <em>the Utopia of Rules</em>, a book filled with social commentaries on bureaucracy and filling out paper forms. Reading that in between the processing and filling out a ton of paperwork was yet another sad irony I encountered. Inevitably and unfortunately, as the night passes, my ability to focus gets decimated. I wish I could accomplish more reading on the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 0300~0400, a little after 12 hours (or 20) into the shift, I’m usually passed out on my desk. In a zombie-like state, I get half-woken up by periodic phone calls but I occasionally sleep through the ringings. Sometimes I answer the phone and pretend to handle whatever they tell me, and then go right back to sleep, forgetting everything I heard. I also get woken up when I have to unlock a small safe with ammunition for those going to a guard shift at night. Even then, my body isn’t fully awake sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By dawn, I can feel my internal organs are rotting. With that, my body starts to produce an uncomfortable amount of gas. A little past 0600, with my internal rhythm resetting, my body spontaneously wakes me up. It’s when I start to get busy again. Meanwhile my body goes through this illusion of feeling refreshed, but soon enough it feels like it has aged about six months over the past six hours. It’s obviously not a great feeling and it takes me about two full days to recover. Five more on-call shifts will age me by two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite such horribleness, the one positive aspect about doing the on-call shifts is that I get to sleep in and rest for the entirety of the next day, getting exempt from pretty much everything. Then, after one shift, two days have gone by just like that. Time flies and a week passes by only after a few days. And I get to rest over the weekend. That’s a good feeling to have in here, the sense of getting closer to the discharge date quicker than how I would feel it otherwise. Just gotta rinse and repeat till I’m out. It’s like Stockholm syndrome - despite how shitty I feel during and after the shift, I’m a bit disappointed that I don’t have a shift this week.</p>

        <br>

	<p>If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard that
there are different date formats in the world such as the American one
(mm/dd/yyyy) and the European one (dd.mm.yyyy). If you’re smart
enough, you’ve probably also noticed that the American one makes no
sense and is just awful. A simple conclusion that many people draw out
of this is that the European format is the best one, however I don’t
think this is true. If you’re one of these people who think so, I’m
here to (hopefully) change your mind by introducing you to a
lesser-known date format called ISO 8601.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>As you can see by the “ISO” part in the format’s name, it’s an actual
standard written by the International Organization for
Standardization. It defines many cool things like a way to write time
intervals, which can be useful for writing portable software, and a
calendar where the year is separated not by months but by weeks, which
is used in finances, but here we’re only interested in the basics.
Simplified, the core date format looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
</code></pre><p>Yup, that’s about it. You write the year, the month, the day, and then
the time exactly like it’s done in other date formats. There’s nothing
extraordinary, so you can learn it in 2 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-better">Why it’s better</h2>
<h3 id="its-unambigous">It’s unambigous</h3>
<p>This is the main reason the standard was written and why people still
use it. Other date formats can be diffucult to tell apart. For
example, consider this date:</p>
<pre><code>02-03-04
</code></pre><p>When you read it out of context, you have absolutely no idea what’s
going on there. Is <code>02</code> here the day or the month? You just can’t know
unless the day in the date is greater than 12, in which case it just
can’t be a month:</p>
<pre><code>30-03-04
</code></pre><p>This day-month ambiguity is a really common problem, which often
occurs online. People just write down their dates in whatever date
format they know without even thinking that other people can interpret
it in different ways.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 doesn’t have this problem as it’s always obvious which part
is the day and which is the month because of the uniqueness of the
format:</p>
<pre><code>2004-03-02
</code></pre><h3 id="its-more-strict">It’s more strict</h3>
<p>While other date formats usually don’t provide strict requirements on
how to write something, ISO 8601 is an exception. Here there’s only
one correct way to write a date, which is not only useful for
computers to parse, but also helpful for humans to avoid confusion
with other formats and improve readability. Here are some of the
restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The elements in the date are always separated by a hyphen. Not many
date formats use this delimiter, and this also can be useful when
using dates inside filenames as slashes are usually not accepted in
them.</li>
<li>The elements are always padded to the maximum number of digits. This
not only makes all of the dates look equally nice, but also, coupled
with other quirks of this format, allows the files with the date in
the name to be sorted just by the filename.</li>
<li>The year is always written in the full form. This makes the format
unique when written down and  eliminates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">the year 2000 problem</a> in
any forms that it can take. For example, when writing down
birthdays, it always makes it obvious which century we’re talking
about.</li>
<li>The time is always written in the 24 hour format, so there can be no
confusion about what half of the day something happened in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="it-makes-more-sense">It makes more sense</h3>
<p>On the first glance, it seems like the European format is about as
logical as it can get - days go into months and months go into years:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>However, this ignores a very important characteristic of numbers -
endianness. Consider a regular number, for example:</p>
<pre><code>69420
&lt;---- Digits
</code></pre><p>As you can see the digits here do the opposite of what elements do in
the European format. When the leftmost element of something is the
most valuable, we call it big endian.</p>
<p>Thus, the European format is little endian while the numbers in it are
big endian:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>And the American format just makes no sense:</p>
<pre><code>12/18/2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
?????????? Elements
</code></pre><p>And, as you can see, ISO 8601 is completely consistent in this regard
as everything is big endian:</p>
<pre><code>2002-12-18
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- Elements
</code></pre><p>The situation becomes even worse if you consider time because it is
big endian, like ISO 8601, thus doesn’t work with any other date
format:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
---------&gt; &lt;------- Elements

12/18/2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
?????????? &lt;------- Elements

2002-12-18 23:03:59
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- &lt;------- Elements
</code></pre><p>If you’re still having trouble visualizing all of this in your head,
look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ISO8601/comments/ln33j2/datetime_format_by_region_visualised_v3_thanks/">this Reddit post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="its-standardized-and-actively-used">It’s standardized and actively used</h3>
<p>If you think that ISO 8601 is a silly thing that someone in their
basement made up and no one actually uses, think again because that
can’t be further from the truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that it’s standardized says at least something. Does your
favorite format has a neat several hundred page document where it’s
described in extreme detail and that is internationally recognized?
Also the standard is quite far from being dead - after being
published in 1988 it was updated in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019.</li>
<li>As I already mentioned, the standard is actively used in IT.
Almost everything that is used by software and somehow involves a
written numerical date format already speaks ISO 8601.</li>
<li>yyyy-mm-dd has been adapted or used since the beginning as a
national date format by many countries such as Canada, Sweden, and
Japan. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country">this article</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="why-not-use-a-format-like-01-jan-2020">Why not use a format like 01-Jan-2020?</h3>
<p>It doesn’t have any of the nice features ISO 8601 has and doesn’t work
well internationally (i.e. assumes the person you’re communicating
with knows knows English). If you think the latter is not a problem,
imagine how you would feel feel if you had to read a date someone
wrote in their native language that you don’t understand:</p>
<pre><code>01-Янв-2020
</code></pre><h3 id="yyyy-mm-dd-looks-weird">yyyy-mm-dd looks weird</h3>
<p>The only reason why it does to you is because you’re not used to it.
After a little bit of practice, it’ll be even less weird than your
favorite date format.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-the-european-date-format-is-better-because-the-elements-are-in-the--order-of-relevance">Maybe the European date format is better because the elements are in the  order of relevance?</h3>
<p>First of all, the claim that the order of relevance is little endian
is quite questionable. The only situation when you can say that for
certain is when we’re talking about events occuring on a day-to-day
basis, however I can think of numerous cases when the year and the
month are more relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article publication date</li>
<li>Historical event</li>
<li>Personal event that happened a long time ago</li>
<li>Someone’s birthday</li>
<li>Random database entry</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the order of relevance is actually irrelevant. Even if the
order of relevance was this way, you’re not reading the dates out
loud, so there’s no need for them to be ordered a certain way. If
you’re not interested in the year, you just skip it and read the end
of the date just like you would do when reading time while not being
interested in the hour.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my opinion, ISO 8601 seems clearly superior to other date formats
when it comes to international communication (such as posting things
online), and as you can see, I have enough reasons to say so. While
the format certainly has an audience, it’s unfortunate that it’s not
as big as it could be. By writing this article, I hope I made you at
least think about different date formats and be more careful when it
comes to making people understand what date you’re talking about.</p>

  </p>

  
  

  <p>Two years ago, I starting learning <a href="https://www.purescript.org/">PureScript</a>.  I
had been intrigued by purely functional programming for some time but had failed
to learn <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> once or twice. PureScript seemed to
be a kinder, gentler introduction to this world while retaining the fundamental
properties of pureness that made Haskell intriguing to me. As part of my
learning process, I rebuilt a slack bot<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I had previously written in go.</p>

<p>Once I had learned PureScript and become more comfortable with purely functional
idioms, the next logical step seemed to be learning Haskell. I was surprised to
discover how much Haskell I already knew from learning PureScript, but core
features like laziness (PureScript is a strict language) took some getting used
to.</p>

<p>I decided to finish my Haskell learning experience by rewriting my slack bot<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
once again, this time in Haskell. In this post I’ll compare and contrast my
experiences writing the same program in Haskell and PureScript. The application
I built was “real” enough to have some interesting design challenges. They
included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exposing an HTTP endpoint</li>
  <li>Parsing and generating JSON</li>
  <li>Full-text search</li>
</ul>

<p>On to the comparison!</p>



<p>Haskell is a lazy language while PureScript is a strict one. I expected this
core difference to manifest itself constantly when writing these applications,
but in reality it rarely came up. I had predicted a lot of banging my head
against the wall dealing with laziness bugs but it just didn’t happen.</p>

<p>I will say that I generally prefer PureScript being a strict-by-default
language. When laziness is required, there are plenty of ways to <a href="https://blog.drewolson.org/laziness-in-purescript">get
it</a>, but it is always explicit.</p>

<p>While not directly related to strictness, a pain point on the PureScript side
that I didn’t experience in Haskell was stack safety<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. In PureScript, it can
often be confusing to determine if the operation you’re using is stack safe.
When these operations <em>aren’t</em> stack safe, the errors that are produced can be
confusing and hard to track down. I found myself struggling with stack safety in
PureScript far more than I struggled with laziness in Haskell.</p>



<p>A year or two ago, I would have simply said that PureScript has incredible
tooling and Haskell does not. Thanks to the amazing work on the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server">Haskell
Language Server</a> project,
this gap is starting to close.</p>

<p>Regardless, PureScript still has far better tooling.
<a href="https://github.com/purescript/spago">Spago</a> is an incredible build tool that
offers many of the same features as
<a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> while remaining far
more user friendly and PureScript’s <a href="https://github.com/nwolverson/purescript-language-server">language
server</a> is excellent
and easy to install.</p>

<p>However, PureScript is currently struggling on a few fronts. First, the package
ecosystem is moving from bower to a
<a href="https://github.com/purescript/registry">registry</a> hosted on Github. The
resulting registry seems to be moving along nicely and I believe the result will
be incredible for the language, but the current in-between state is unfortunate.
I am glad the core maintainers are taking their time to design this registry
well and I firmly believe that this will be a strong positive for the PureScript
community in 6-12 months.</p>

<p>Second, PureScript doesn’t have a great option for a formatter. While
<a href="https://gitlab.com/joneshf/purty">purty</a> does exist, it seems to be mostly in
maintenance mode and many of the formatting choices are frustrating for me.
Specifically, the automatic removal of blank lines within functions and the
addition of newlines for <code>let</code> assignments in <code>do</code> blocks both hamper
readability and author intent. On the Haskell side,
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ormolu">ormolu</a> was easy to install and
“just worked”.</p>



<p>It’s not a controversial statement to say that Haskell has far more language
features than PureScript. It’s also not a new observation to say that it is
challenging to determine which of these features one should be using and what
extensions one should enable to use them. Here’s the list of default extensions
I have enabled for my project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DataKinds</li>
  <li>DeriveGeneric</li>
  <li>FlexibleContexts</li>
  <li>FlexibleInstances</li>
  <li>GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</li>
  <li>InstanceSigs</li>
  <li>LambdaCase</li>
  <li>MultiParamTypeClasses</li>
  <li>NamedFieldPuns</li>
  <li>OverloadedStrings</li>
  <li>ScopedTypeVariables</li>
  <li>TypeApplications</li>
  <li>TypeOperators</li>
</ul>

<p>I found Haskell’s deriving capabilities to be more powerful than PureScript and
led to reduced boilerplate, especially when creating my application monad. I
also like that Haskell’s type class instances do not require names. The names
required by PureScript add very little in terms of readability or author intent.</p>

<p>By far the biggest difference I felt between the two languages is the way they
deal with records. Again, this isn’t a new observation, but it can not be
overstated how much better PureScript’s records are than Haskell’s. Records
based on row polymorphism are a joy to work with, as is having a dedicated
syntax for creating, updating, and accessing records. GHC does have an <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst">accepted
proposal</a>
for adding record dot syntax which will solve many of these problems, but I
think the underlying implementation based on row polymorphism will continue to
give PureScript the edge here.</p>



<p>When I first learned PureScript I compared its compile times to other statically
typed languages like Rust, Go, and Java. I found it much slower than these other
languages, though incremental rebuilds were generally quite fast. I assumed upon
moving to Haskell that the situation would be comparable or better. I was very
wrong.</p>

<p>Compilation times in Haskell are significantly worse than PureScript, often by
an order or two of magnitude when compiling a project’s dependencies. I say this
less to rag on Haskell (this seems like a challenging problem to tackle), but
more to applaud the PureScript community for the work they’ve already done on
this front.</p>



<p>Haskell has a far larger ecosystem of packages than PureScript – kind of. In
terms of Haskell and PureScript in isolation, Haskell has a vastly superior
collection of packages and the quality of these packages is generally very high.
However, PureScript has done a great job of porting over many of the best
Haskell packages.</p>

<p>Additionally, PureScript gives you access to the entire ecosystem of JavaScript
packages via FFI. While many in the community find this to be something of a
disadvantage, from a practical perspective it is fantastic. As an example, when
building full-text search for Haskell, I ended up using the full-text-search
package. It was fully featured and comprehensive, but required <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot-hs/blob/736e4a47a29f8935ecb489d3cdbeb48b738c34ca/src/Epicbot/Data/Index/SearchEngine.hs">quite a
bit</a>
of code to get working.</p>

<p>On the PureScript side, I built a <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot/blob/e7e93d2e2642ae135c92c6ff5b73b733685b550e/src/Epicbot/Index.js">simple FFI
wrapper</a>
around elasticlunr. While I understand that the JavaScript ecosystem has
packages of variable quality, it does have <em>lots</em> of package solving <em>many</em>
problems and PureScript’s FFI makes it extremely easy to leverage this giant
ecosystem in a safe way.</p>



<p>For my PureScript application I chose the
<a href="https://github.com/cprussin/purescript-httpure">HTTPure</a>. It was light-weight
and easy to use while feeling idiomatic. This was a relatively simple choice
because there are few options for server-side frameworks within the PureScript
ecosystem that included the features I needed (specifically middleware).</p>

<p>On the Haskell side, the choice of web framework was more complicated. I wanted
something small and light-weight, but with the ability work within my custom
monad stack for my application. I ended up using <a href="">scotty</a>, but the default
middleware solution doesn’t operate within your application’s monad stack, so I
needed to explicitly provide middleware-like-functions for <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot-hs/blob/736e4a47a29f8935ecb489d3cdbeb48b738c34ca/src/Epicbot/Web/Router.hs#L33-L34">each
endpoint</a>
in my router.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this was mostly a wash between languages, but I expected
the Haskell ecosystem to be far more mature in the backend HTTP service space.</p>



<p>To deploy my PureScript application, I used
<a href="https://github.com/vercel/ncc">ncc</a>. While this required that I had <code>node</code>
available in my deployment environment, it made everything else easy. The <code>ncc</code>
tool produced a single, self-contained JavaScript file that included all of the
application code along with required dependencies. I then simply <code>scp</code>‘d this to
my deployment environment and ran it with <code>node</code>.</p>

<p>On the Haskell side, I used stack’s docker support to build my application’s
executable within a container that matches my deployment environment (debian),
and then shipped the resulting executable via <code>scp</code> as well. The executable was
completely self-contained.</p>

<p>Overall, both approaches felt equivalent in terms of ease. On the PureScript
side, it is a bit frustrating to need <code>node</code> within the deployment environment.
On the Haskell side, there was the added complication of having to use docker
for cross-compilation. Overall, though, both experiences were reasonably nice.</p>



<p>In reading over this post, I worry that it feels like I’m picking on Haskell –
I’m absolutely not. I’m very aware that PureScript is <em>heavily</em> influenced by
Haskell and is standing the shoulders of giants. PureScript was able to learn
from some of the mistakes of Haskell and make choices about intentional
departures from the Haskell ecosystem that better fit the intended use cases of
PureScript.</p>

<p>I found the experiences of learning and using both Haskell and PureScript very
rewarding. I will admit to being surprised at how well PureScript compared to
Haskell in the server-side HTTP space, given that its primary focus is currently
on the front end. I think both languages have a bright future and I’m excited to
follow their continued development.</p>

<p>For this week’s <strong>musing</strong>, I want to expand on an issue that came up in the discussion in the universal warrior series, which was the question of changing <strong>lethality</strong> in warfare.  Just how likely were you to <em>die</em> on the battlefield in different eras, and how did changing offensive, defensive and medical technologies alter that balance?  One assumption I see frequently is that since the advent of modern medicine has made serious infections survivable, it must follow that basically all wounds were fatal in the pre-modern period.  Of course balanced against this is the relatively higher lethality of modern weapons, which strike with much greater energies and in consequence do much more damage to the body.  So where does the answer lie?</p>



<p>(Just a quick reminder that these musings are just that: me talking through an idea and to some degree thinking out loud with the information I have available.  Consequently, you should take any of the conclusions here as preliminary; whatever level of confidence you place in my normal ‘Collections’ ramblings, a ‘musing’ is probably at least a half-a-notch lower in the ‘epistemological certainty’ scale.)</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it is complex.  The first question we need to ask is what kind of mortality we are interested in.  If we include non-combat related disease deaths, those will swamp combat related deaths, but there are problems with this.  Estimates for disease-losses in pre-industrial armies (some of these figures compiled in Rosenstein, <em>Rome at War</em> (2004), 130-2) vary tremendously; late nineteenth century rule of thumb held that disease casualties would be four times battle deaths; but in the American Civil War and the Boer War they were only twice battle deaths and in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War, they were actually four times <em>less</em> than battle deaths.  Basic sanitation, it turns out, matters a lot here.  The next problem is that here our question needs to be about <em>excess</em> deaths because of course some level of disease is prevalence in the larger society; that is even harder to calculate, but if we fail to adjust for that, all we are doing is measuring the size of armies, since the background disease death rate in the pre-modern world was so elevated.  In this case, I think it is best to remove non-combat disease deaths from the equation, since the concern here was the experience of battle, so we should limit ourselves to violent death in war.</p>



<p>Except that brings us to the next question, which is the word ‘battle.’  Are we limiting ourselves to <em>battles</em> or not?  If we want to consider warfare as a totality, then the evidence is fairly clear that violent death <em>per capita</em> (so adjusting for population growth) decreases as a function of time (on this, note A Gat, <em>War in Human Civilization</em> (2006) rather than S. Pinker, <em>Better Angels of Our Nature</em> (2011).  Yes, I am aware that the former has spoken highly of the latter’s book, but frankly the more careful and cautious argument of <em>War</em> is to be preferred).  This decline isn’t necessary a smooth curve, but seems to move in steps with lots of variation within those steps.  Lifetime violent mortality among early hunter-gatherers and other non-state peoples seems to have been on the order of 15% (with some examples above 25% generally.  These deaths were concentrated among males; a 15% overall rate of violent mortality might mean a 25% rate among males and only a 5% rate among females).  For pre-industrial agrarian state-societies, that figure falls to single-digit percentages, often very low single digits, but perhaps sometimes as high as 5-10% (some estimates for the military mortality of the Romans during the worst years of the Second Punic War run up to 20% of the adult male population, so c. 7% of the total population; I think this is a smidge too high and perhaps 5% is more correct).  In post-nuclear, post-industrial states where conventional war is often sharply constrained by deterrence and the industrial revolution means that returns to trade and investment are higher than returns to war (the reverse being true previously) that figure often falls to fractions of a percent, but again with potentially wide variance in the event of rare but extremely destructive wars.</p>



<p>But – and you knew there was a but coming – but that absolutely massive hunter-gatherer lethality level isn’t generally in <em>battles</em>.  The bulk of those deaths occur during very one-sided ambushes and raids, directed at individuals who are effectively incapable of fighting back.  So we might ask the question a different way: <strong>what was the chance of dying in a particular <em>battle</em> at a given point of time</strong>?  Once again, that’s complicated, in part because reliable casualty statistics for <em>losing</em> armies are often frustratingly rare even well into the modern period.  But there are a few observations we can make in terms of how technology might have impacted these changes.  First, in both West Africa and North America, we can observe that the introduction of gunpowder so radically increased the lethality of open battles that tactics shifted entirely away from them.  Now, this might not be surprising in North America, where the battles in question were of the first-system type – lower lethality missile exchanges when the raid or the ambush had failed .  But in West Africa, the battles in question were often state-on-state and concluded with shock infantry engagements (with a notable use of blunt weapons, since part of the goal in battle was for the victor to take many captives; on this see Lee, <em>Waging War</em>, ch. 8), yet even in that context the increased lethality of gunpowder meant that such battles had to be discontinued in a context where the demographics of the underlying society simply couldn’t support massive losses.  <strong>So the strong suggestion here is that gunpowder weapons represented a significant increase not merely in the lethality of the weapons but of the battles themselves.</strong></p>



<p>We might also compare individual battles or campaigns.  Rosenstein (<em>op. cit.</em>) estimates that for the Romans from 200 to 168 BCE (the period of our most sustained data, due to Livy), the Roman battle-death rate was very roughly 8-9% of soldiers engaged.  That accords fairly well with the general 5-15% rule of thumb often posited for hoplite combat in Classical Greece (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/934hfj/what_was_the_casualty_rate_for_battles_between/">but note the difficulties with those figures</a>).  To compare with, say, the Battle of Austerlitz (1805), there the French had c. 75,000 men and the coalition c. 90,000 and the former took c. 9,000 casualties to the latter’s c. 36,000; so out of 165,000 men engaged, 45,000 had become casualties (27%); it’s hard to say exactly how many <em>died</em> because the looser’s casualties in Napoleonic battles often aren’t broken out clearly between dead, captured and injured (because the loser is not in the position to count the field).  At least on the French side, the wounded outnumbered the dead roughly 5-to-1.  At Waterloo, where it is the coalition who won and thus have the more precise figures, British wounded outnumbered dead about 3-to-1, while Prussian wounded outnumbered dead by 3.5-to-1.  At Gettysburg (1863), with 104,256 Union and 75,000 Confederate forces engaged, there were 23,055 union casualties (3,155 killed, a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 4.6-to-1) and perhaps 23,231 confederate losses (4,708 killed, a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 1.2-to-1); about 25% of men engaged had become casualties of some sort, about 4-5% of those engaged had been killed.  I’d suggest that the flurry of figures there suggests, broadly, casualties moving very broadly within the same basic range as a percentage of men deployed.  Our ability to get a sense of the impact of wounds is complicated by the fact that pre-gunpowder sources tend not to give solid numbers for the wounded at all.</p>



<p>Now the question is how does the industrial revolution and antibiotics change this?  Well, for some World War I examples (post-industrialization, pre-widespread antibiotics), at the First Battle of the Marne (1914), roughly 1 million British and French troops had squared off against 900,000 Germans; both sides took around a quarter of a million losses (so c. 25%) of which c. 149,400 were killed (7.8%).  At the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes (also 1914), 215,000 Germans met 146,000 Russians with 10,000 German losses and 70,000 Russian WIA or KIA and another 30,000 prisoners, so roughly 30% casualties, but unclear what slice of those were deaths.  At Kolubara (1914), 400,000 Serbs faced off against 450,000 Austrian troops, with 405,000 total casualties, of which 52,000 were deaths (the WIA to KIA ratio was 5-to-1).  I’ve tried to pull major battles in 1914 because the long battles of the trench stalemate are difficult to generalize figures from as units rotate in and out.  Taking a longer view, some roughly eight million Frenchmen served in the first world war, of which 1,150,000 died in combat (not counting disease), suggesting a combat mortality rate over the whole war of a <em>staggering</em> (by modern standards) 12.5% (though note above that many non-state societies lived in a situation of WWI casualty levels <em>in every generation</em>).</p>



<p>(Update: note that the casualty figures here include KIA, WIA and MIA, so I’ve obtained the WIA-to-KIA ratio by by directly comparing those two figures, without the MIAs.  That seemed to have been confusing some folks in the comments.)</p>



<p>For post-industrialization, post-antibiotics, options are narrower.  American, British and Commonwealth forces had good access to …</p></div></div>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="programrejectedformentalhealthreasons">PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</h2>
<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>
<pre><code>       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL
       PLEASE ,1 &lt;- #5
       DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #54
       DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #192
       DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #136
       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #208
       DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #98
       DO COME FROM (1)
       DO READ OUT ,1
(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #134
(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)
</code></pre>
<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>
<h2 id="variablesmaynotbestoredinwesthyperspace">VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</h2>
<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name="i" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0"&gt;FizzBuzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 3 = 0"&gt;Fizz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 5 = 0"&gt;Buzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$i" /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="$i &amp;lt; 100"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="$i + 1" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

No matter how generous and smart we think we are in our private giving, unless we shift from trying to minimize our taxes to advocating to be taxed more, we are not living up to being “for humanity.” Are most millionaires there yet? No. I do feel a shift is starting, though. Please keep encouraging us — and keep pressuring us, too.</p><p><strong>ANAND: You have an interesting personal background that led you to this place of advocating for structural change as a very rich person. Tell us about your journey.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>I am one of those who gets highlighted by the media as a “self-made man.” I am told that I fit the storyline: I am an immigrant son of a single mother from Iran; while my mum cleaned in hotels, I studied hard, worked hard, and became a successful entrepreneur. I rose to be a multimillionaire — the American dream, except in Denmark!</p><p>It has always been evident to me, however, that I have not risen all by my own efforts: that I am&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a “self-made man,” that the&nbsp;<em>welfare state</em>&nbsp;made me. Without the creche care and schooling and health care I received, I could not have flourished. And without Denmark’s strong public services, neither could my business.</p><p><strong>ANAND: What was your epiphany, if any, in realizing that very rich people like yourself need to be reined in rather than asked to give back?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>I knew it as a working-class immigrant child. Later, when I became rich and got involved in philanthropy across the world, I witnessed that while philanthropy can help ameliorate tough times for some people, it is only in collective action through government policy that we can we achieve a fair society and shared prosperity. All the data bear out what I witnessed. The way I put it to my fellow rich people is this: there is a title that is more noble and consequential than “Generous Philanthropist,” and that title is “Happy Taxpayer.”</p><p><strong>ANAND: Since you’re speaking as a rich guy on these topics, give us a sense of how rich we’re talking about, without disclosing any of your account numbers or PINs.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>I made many millions of dollars, and I made them relatively young. I have three places I call home. I never worry about money. DM for my PIN.</p><p><strong>ANAND: What are the most significant structural changes that you think are necessary to attack wealth and income inequality worldwide and in certain countries in particular?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>We need a wealth tax everywhere. We need quality free health and education for everyone, everywhere. We need a green new deal everywhere. There’s no country where this is impossible, and no country where this is not necessary.</p><p><strong>ANAND: There has been a lot of recent discussion of a wealth tax in America, but even the most ambitious of the serious proposals, by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are quite far from being “erosive” wealth taxes. In other words, even at a top rate of 8 or 10 percent, most billionaires’ fortunes would grow rather than shrink each year under their plans. Do you think we need to go further and have an erosive wealth tax?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>You make an excellent point that even if there is a wealth tax, rich people can make so much from the interest on their capital that we will still keep getting richer, just less fast. The most important thing now is to initiate the wealth tax because there’s so much nonsense talk about how it “cannot” be done. Of course&nbsp;it can. The only way to move on from that debate is to bring a wealth tax in&nbsp;<em>now</em>. Someone has to pay for the recovery from Covid-19, in which everyone except the rich has lost. Are we multimillionaires going to say it’s not us? Are we going to be such shmucks, such losers, and say no?</p><p><strong>ANAND: You live in Denmark. Many Americans, especially people who aspire to business success like you’ve had, believe that if we were to adopt policies like Denmark’s, capitalism would die, and gulags would sprout across the land. Are they correct?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>They could not be more wrong.&nbsp;In real life, contrary to the Hollywood tale, kids are more likely to achieve the American dream in Denmark than in America. America is not a beacon to the world on how to run an economy. Scandinavia has a much more impressive economic record than the US and is much more innovative. Sorry, my American friends — we’re not just fairer than you. We’re doing&nbsp;<em>better</em>&nbsp;by being so.</p><p><strong>ANAND: In America, wealthy individuals and businesses lobby for a threadbare safety net to pay less in taxes. But this creates a complication. It puts the onus on companies to figure out healthcare for their employees, to make these awful life-or-death decisions about pensions and maternity leave and the like. And what I often hear from friends who are in business in Europe is how much easier it is to do business when you’re not making all these societal decisions about your employees’ well-being and health and life and children as part of your operation.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>Absolutely. And that’s just&nbsp;part&nbsp;of it. Social stability, low crime, a well-educated population, and great infrastructure are good for business. As we put it, the right thing to do is also the smart thing to do. We could also put it this way: the mean way to run an economy is also the dumb way to run an economy.</p><p><strong>ANAND: Should billionaires exist?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>In a well-regulated, well-managed, and thriving economy without monopolies, they wouldn’t. Wealth is like manure: spread it, and it makes everything grow; pile it up, and it stinks.</p><p><strong>ANAND: You advocate going “beyond philanthropy” and doing real structural change. I wonder what you think of the argument that philanthropy isn’t merely inadequate. That it can be actively part of the problem, by buying off a certain amount of anger, laundering reputations, and intensifying the plutocrats’ stranglehold over public conversation and power?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>You make a vital point. Right now, philanthropy is treated as an alternative to structural change. I focus on structural change, and I am working to persuade other multimillionaires to join me, advocating for a wealth tax on people like us. I still do philanthropy, but I know that it is no solution. You know, the thrill of seeing your nameplate on one school or a hundred schools is pretty empty in the end, compared to the thrill that we will all feel when&nbsp;<em>every child in the world</em>&nbsp;goes to a good school. Philanthropy is just so&nbsp;unambitious.</p><p><strong>ANAND: One of the features of the neoliberal age is that politicians, even left-leaning ones, are reluctant to use the language of “I welcome their hatred” that President Franklin Roosevelt used long ago. Do you think we need a little more class warfare, as it’s sometimes derisively called, rather than less of it?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>Warren Buffet was right when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/business/yourmoney/26every.html">he said</a>, “There’s&nbsp;class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”&nbsp;We set up <a href="https://www.millionairesforhumanity.com/">Millionaires for Humanity</a> as an international network to help more millionaires move across from the dark side.</p><p><strong>ANAND: Explain Elon Musk to me in one sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>There’s not much “there” there, is there?</p><p><em>Djaffar Shalchi is an entrepreneur from Denmark and founder of <a href="https://www.millionairesforhumanity.com/">Millionaires for Humanity</a>, a network of wealthy people who advocate for raising taxes on wealthy people.

<h2>
  <big>redbean</big><br>
  <small>single-file distributable web server</small>
</h2>

<p>
  redbean makes it possible to share web applications that run offline
  as a
  single-file <a aria-label="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/ape.html">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> zip archive which contains your assets. All
  you need to do is download the <code>redbean.com</code> program below,
  change the filename to .zip, add your content in a zip tool like
  Windows 10 or InfoZIP, and change the extension back to .com.

</p><p>
  redbean can serve 1 million+ gzip encoded responses per second on a
  cheap personal computer. That performance is thanks to zip and gzip
  using the same compression format, which enables kernelspace copies.
  Another reason redbean goes fast is that it's a tiny static binary,
  which makes fork memory paging nearly free.

</p><p>
  redbean is also easy to modify to suit your own needs. The program
  itself is written as a single .c file.

  Assets can be listed by running the following command:

</p><pre>unzip -vl redbean.com        # lists files

<p>
  Assets can be added to the zip archive as follows:

</p><pre>zip redbean.com index.html   # adds file
</pre>

<p>
  By default, anything you add to the archive gets compressed. Sometimes
  you don't want that to happen. A good example is video files. The web
  browser will want to send HTTP range requests to seek in the video, in
  which case redbean requires that the asset be uncompressed.

</p><pre>zip -0 redbean.com video.mp4  # adds file without compression
</pre>

<p>
  Each connection uses a point in time snapshot of your ZIP file.
  If your ZIP is deleted then serving continues. If it's replaced
  then issuing SIGUSR1 (or SIGHUP if daemon) will reindex the zip
  for subsequent connections without interrupting active ones. If
  SIGINT or SIGTERM is issued then a graceful shutdown is started
  but if it's issued a second time, active connections are reset.

Thank you, <a href="https://kevzettler.com/">Kev Zettler</a>, for showing your work on the Dasung Paperlike Pro and making all of this possible. I will later create an accompanying video to go over the Dasung HD-FT teardown process.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_203519.jpg"></p><h2 id="overview-of-the-dasung-hd-ft">Overview of the Dasung HD-FT</h2><p>The Dasung HD-FT is a third-generation e-ink monitor with a display of 13.3“, a screen resolution of 2200x1650, a touchscreen, and an adjustable backlight. The monitor connects via a proprietary Y cable, with connections for USB and HDMI; additionally, the Dasung HD-FT can be powered by the micro-usb connection on the left side.</p><p>Once connected to a computer, it acts as a second monitor or, for our purposes, a primary monitor for our e-ink laptop. The monitor’s physical buttons allow you to adjust the contrast, brightness, clear the screen, and change modes.</p><p>The modes (M1, M2, M3, Fast, Fast++, Black, Black+, Black++) correspond to how the monitor displays what’s rendered in the screen using different shades of grey or black/white.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look and dismantle the Dasung HD-FT and look at its components.</p><h2 id="opening-the-dasung-paperlike-hd-ft">Opening the Dasung Paperlike HD-FT</h2><p>Similar to Zettler’s observations and approach, the Dasung HD-FT is made of one piece of construction. I first began with a knife, carefully prying the outer edges of the Dasung Monitor where it’s all glued and making my way slowly through all of the sides.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_194558.jpg"></p><p>Once I finished prying through all of the sides, what became visible were the screws that were holding everything together.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_194714.jpg"></p><p>After removing all of the screws, I was able to gain access to the panel!</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_203519.jpg"></p><h2 id="the-e-ink-display-module-and-control-board">The E-ink display module and control board</h2><p>Like Zettler discovered, the Dasung HD-FT chip components upon closer inspection were also chemically peeled off to prevent reverse engineering of the e-ink display and control board.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201821.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201158.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201211.jpg"></p><h2 id="es133tt3-display-module">ES133TT3 Display Module</h2><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201921.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202037.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202009.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202020.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202024.jpg"></p><p>The e-ink display module model number for the Dasung HD-FT is the: <span><strong>ES133TT3</strong></span></p><p>beck-elektronik<span data-nosnippet=""><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></span> describes it as “<em>reflective electrophoretic E Ink technology display module based on active matrix TFT and plastic substrate.

<p>Oh come on!  Don’t play it safe and only go just go for a Coke or Pepsi.  You’re in Japan now.  It’s time to try something more adventurous.</p>



<p>Vending machines mainly for carbonated drinks started appearing across the country in 1960.&nbsp; Now there are an estimated 2,470,000 of them throughout Japan or 1 for approximately every 50 people.&nbsp; Thus, it is easy to grab either a cold or hot drink virtually anywhere in the country on a 24/7 basis.</p>



<p>While the same global players such as Coca-Cola and national powerhouses in the beverage industry like Suntory do, in fact, dominate distribution via vending machines and other channels, relatively obscure minor entrants have still managed to carve out a niche with several unique offerings.&nbsp; Even the big boys have become used to granting a creative license to their marketers to go well beyond normal colas.</p>

<p>The sheer variety of beverages—<em>both non-alcoholic and alcoholic</em>—available in Japan is staggering. &nbsp;To make sense of it all is soft drink critic Ryoko Shimizu (aside–<em>now that’s a cool job!</em>).&nbsp; She has been reviewing the world of non-alcoholic Japanese beverages since the 1980s.&nbsp; Shimizu recently published a <a href="https://news.nifty.com/article/entame/etc/12113-930661/">Top 50 list of her all-time favorites</a> (the original article in Japanese only).</p>



<p>…but wait!  First you need to know this.</p>



<h3><strong>What’s a <em>supodo</em>?</strong></h3>



<p><em>Supodo</em> (スポド) is an abbreviation for the made-up English term “sports drink” in Japanese.&nbsp; This category is a type of soft drink that replenishes the water and minerals lost from the body due to perspiration, especially during exercise. &nbsp;It supposedly helps to prevent dehydration and the potential for heatstroke while playing sports under the scorching sun.</p>



<h3><strong>Top Fifty</strong></h3>



<p>Okay, now that this term has been defined, let’s get to Shimizu’s extensive list which includes plenty of <em>supodo</em> as well as other types of drinks!</p>



<p>Not all of her favorites are still around, but, despite humble beginnings in some cases, a surprising number have since gone mainstream.&nbsp; Scroll down to see how Shimizu ranked them by counting backward from 50 down to 1:</p>



<h4>#50 Sports Mugicha</h4>



<p><strong>Sports Mugicha</strong> sold in the 1990s by Kanebo:&nbsp; Shimizu wrote, “When I first heard the name of this drink, my first impression was that it must be a blend of traditional barley tea and a ‘sports drink.’&nbsp; It consists, in fact, of a combination of an appropriate amount of salt mixed with regular barley tea to enhance its absorption into the body. &nbsp;The can was decorated with a theme from the professional baseball team Yokohama BayStars.”</p>

<h4>#49 Mountain Dew</h4>



<p><strong>Mountain Dew</strong> launched in 1981 by Pepsi Co:&nbsp; This long-seller, which is still popular today, is marketed in Japan with the tag line “new citrus beverage.”&nbsp; The package has changed little over the years.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Mountain Dew (written in Japanese), Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#48 Tab Clear</h4>



<p><strong>Tab Clear</strong> launched in 1993 by Coca-Cola:&nbsp; Shimizu commented, “It became a hot topic because it was a transparent cola, but I remember that it was subtle in terms of taste. Kotaro Tawara, a popular newscaster at the time, appeared in a commercial.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="245" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea.jpg 245w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea-230x300.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"><figcaption>Tab Clear, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#47 Tsubu-Tsubu Orange</h4>



<p><strong>Tsubu-Tsubu Orange</strong> was sold in the 1990s by Yamato:&nbsp; This orange drink was conceived based upon the trend of mashed fruit drinks in the 1980s.&nbsp; “Tsubu” means “bead” or “drop” in Japanese.&nbsp; When it was launched, Tsubu-Tsubu Orange lacked national distribution.&nbsp; It was only marketed locally in Nagoya, near where it was made.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="208" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg 208w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px"><figcaption>Tsubu Tsubu Orange, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#46 Post Water</h4>



<p><strong>Post Water</strong> launched in 1990 by Kirin:&nbsp; Made from lychees, this <em>supodo</em>  or “sports drink” made quite a scene when it debuted in an unusually-shaped flask.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="554" height="554" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter.jpg 554w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter-300x300.jpg 300w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px"><figcaption>Post Water, Image sourced from Twitter</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#45 Cheerio Grape</h4>



<p><strong>Cheerio Grape</strong> launched in 1965 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Shimizu fondly recalls Cheerio’s Grape drink as being for sale at the candy store near her childhood home.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="204" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea.jpg 204w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea-191x300.jpg 191w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px"><figcaption>Cheerio Grape, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#44 J Water</h4>



<p><strong>J Water</strong> launched in 1993 by Suntory:&nbsp; This drink made its debut as an officially licensed beverage of the J League or Japan Professional Football (soccer) League back when J League was new.&nbsp; This “sports drink” did not have a particularly distinctive taste, but the taste was secondary to packaging in any case.&nbsp; There are also team-specific variants.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="195" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg 195w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online-183x300.jpg 183w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px"><figcaption>J. Water, Image sourced from Bunshun Online</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#43 Ambasa</h4>



<p><strong>Ambasa</strong> launched in 1982 by Coca-Cola:&nbsp; Shimizu commented, “I felt a little &nbsp;uncomfortable with the unfamiliar word ‘Ambasa’ at first, but I quickly got used to it because it was put into virtually every Coca-Cola vending machine.” &nbsp;This carbonated beverage looks milky and tastes lighter than Calpis Soda. &nbsp;There were also melon and pine flavors for a while.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea.jpg 240w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"><figcaption>Ambasa, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#42 Apple Oolong Soda</h4>



<p><strong>Apple Oolong Soda</strong> launched in 1988 by Kirin:&nbsp; This is another drink that relies primarily upon packaging to drum up sales.&nbsp; It features characters from the anime Modern Children (いまどきのこども), which attracted a lot of attention when launched.  It is still fairly popular.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Apple Oolong Soda, Image sourced from Bunshun Online</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#41 Sweet Kiss</h4>



<p><strong>Sweet Kiss</strong> launched in 1982 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Sweet Kiss is sort of a variant of Mountain Dew (#49) and features a distinctive graphic design.&nbsp; It is, however, still relatively difficult to find this drink even in Tokyo.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="442" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net.jpg 590w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"><figcaption>Sweet  Kiss, Image sourced from J Town Net</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#40 Saruo Monkey King</h4>



<p><strong>Saruo Monkey King</strong> launched in 1994 by Lotte:&nbsp; The name Saruo literally means “monkey king” in Japanese.&nbsp; It was originally marketed as an exclusive type of oolong tea made from tea leaves grown on cliffs where monkeys like to forage food.&nbsp; There is, naturally, some question about whether monkeys actually harvest tea leaves.&nbsp; One of the respondents reportedly remarked in a taste test, “It sort of smells like a monkey.”&nbsp; Luckily for the brand, there are, however, plenty of other people who disagree!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="216" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea.jpg 216w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea-203x300.jpg 203w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px"><figcaption>Saruo or “monkey king” in Japanese, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#39 Afternoon Tea</h4>



<p><strong>Afternoon Tea</strong> launched in sold in 1986 by Kirin:&nbsp; This drink is a best selling long-runner.&nbsp; It is fairly sweet and was the first black tea sold in a 1.5 liter PET bottle.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="194" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg 194w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea-182x300.jpg 182w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px"><figcaption>Afternoon Tea, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#38 Bireley’s Orange</h4>



<p><strong>Bireley’s Orange</strong> launched in 1951 by Asahi:&nbsp; The name of this ultra-long-runner, “Birely’s,” used to be synonymous orange juice. Since the 1970s, when restrictions were introduced that limited marketers’ ability to label a drink as juice unless it was 100% juice, Birely’s had to drop the reference to juice.&nbsp; This minor setback did, however,  not make a major dent in its market share.  The brand is still sold today.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Bireley’s Orange, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#37 Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can</h4>



<p><strong>Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can</strong> launched in 1997 by Soka Komatsuen:&nbsp; This is a locally produced drink made to help immortalize the famous baseball player Hideki Matsui who was also a “favorite son” of Ishikawa Prefecture.&nbsp; Matsui, whose nickname was “Godzilla,” was a home run king who went on to play for the New York Yankees.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea.jpg 214w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"><figcaption>Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#36 Honey Lemon</h4>



<p><strong>Honey Lemon</strong> launched in 1986 by Suntory:&nbsp; This fruit drink experienced explosive sales upon its release.&nbsp; Suntory had a problem, though.&nbsp; As they could not register a trademark for “honey lemon” or even its nickname in Japanese <em>hachi-lemo</em>, this particular name essentially became its own category because several other manufacturers flooded the market with similar drinks by the same name.&nbsp; It is a classic example of just how cut-throat the non-alcoholic drink industry can be in Japan.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="225" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea.jpg 225w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><figcaption>Honey Lemon, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#35 McCOL</h4>



<p><strong>McCOL</strong> launched in 1982 by MMC:&nbsp; This collector’s item has long since been taken off the market.&nbsp; It was, apparently, relatively hard to find even when it was available through the mid-1990s.&nbsp; McCOL was marketed as “barley cola,” but it looked just like any other cola.&nbsp; The taste was a combination of barley tea and cider.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="197" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/McCOL-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/McCOL-Image-from-Crea.jpg 197w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/McCOL-Image-from-Crea-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px"><figcaption>McCOL, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#34 TESS Milk Tea</h4>



<p><strong>TESS Milk Tea</strong> sold in the late 1980s by Suntory:&nbsp; TESS had a relatively short lifetime as a semi-sweet type of milk tea.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="238" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tess-Milk-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tess-Milk-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg 238w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tess-Milk-Tea-Image-from-Crea-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px"><figcaption>TESS Milk Tea, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#33 NCAA</h4>



<p><strong>NCAA</strong> launched in 1981 by Suntory:&nbsp; Named for the National College Athletic Association (NCAA), this classic sports drink was introduced as “the brand new thirst quencher for those who love sports.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="193" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NCAA-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NCAA-Image-from-Crea.jpg 193w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NCAA-Image-from-Crea-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px"><figcaption>NCAA, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#32 Atamaruko</h4>



<p><strong>Atamaruko</strong> launched in 1990 by Suntory:&nbsp; This citrus mixture of kumquats and calamansi (aka “Philippine lime”) was actually sold hot in the heated section of vending machines. Its name means, in fact, “A Child to Warm You Up.”&nbsp; The cute package design proved effective at attracting customers. &nbsp;It actually led to a second-generation character called “Nacchan” that became even more famous than Atamaruko, who was relegated to the status of “the unknown older sister.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="223" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Atamaruko-Image-from-Suntory.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Atamaruko-Image-from-Suntory.jpg 223w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Atamaruko-Image-from-Suntory-209x300.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px"><figcaption>Atamaruko, Image sourced from Suntory</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#31 Gatorade</h4>



<p><strong>Gatorade</strong> sold in the 1980s by Yukijirushi:&nbsp; Having been replaced by homegrown rival Pocari Sweat, American uber-brand Gatorade is no longer sold in cans in Japan. It was, though, the first “sports drink” to appear in Japan.&nbsp; At that point, Gatorade was only available as a powder.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="198" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatorade-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatorade-Image-from-Crea.jpg 198w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatorade-Image-from-Crea-186x300.jpg 186w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px"><figcaption>Gatorade, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#30 Dr. Nakamatsu’s Head Tea</h4>



<p><strong>Dr. Nakamatsu’s Head Tea</strong> launched in 1994 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Now we’re entering the realm of the truly odd.&nbsp; Named for Dr. Yoshiro Nakamatsu, a leading researcher of “smart foods” at the time of launch, this strong blended tea was somehow supposed to enhance cognitive capability.&nbsp; Years later, the same Dr. Nakamatsu gained additional notoriety outside Japan by winning the “Ig Noble …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="hn-hijacks-your-brain">HN hijacks your brain</h2>
<p>You're an engineer who looks at Hacker News 2-5 times a day. HN is a good way to <em>fill the gaps</em> in time. You scan the front page- repeatedly- for links of interest... reading titles, eyeing scores... often jumping directly to the (overtly contrarian) comments to see if a link is even worth the energy.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>That cycle hits a sickening <strong>5</strong>/10 of Tristan Harris's <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">list of mind hijacks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Control the Menu, Control the Choices</li>
<li>(3)  Fear of missing something important</li>
<li>(4)  Social Approval (upvotes)</li>
<li>(6)  Bottomless bowl</li>
<li>(10) Forecasting</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These hijacks  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">aren't</a> intentional, they're just a byproduct of link aggregation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoics are turning in their graves, where instead of knowing what's important, the links on HN <em>become</em> what's important, no matter how trivial, pedantic, hyped, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>So if you want help breaking this negative feedback loop, I encourage you to reclaim your attention by turning HN into and RSS feed;</p>
<p>Get more <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">done</a>. Ignore the comments and the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">mooks</a>. Set limits. It's incredibly liberating to finish your RSS feed and think to yourself, <em>now what</em>?</p>

<p>Declaring what deserves your attention is the defining feature of RSS, so it's important to declare what aspect of HN you like. Generally people look at high scores. Fortunately HN already has a url specifically for its most "important" (i.e. upvoted) links: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a>.</p>
<p>So if we can subscribe to the links from that page, we'll get the bulk of the links that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>For me, it's critically important for RSS to be a self-hosted solution. No third parties <small>(I'm looking at <em>you</em>, Feedly)</small>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of retaking control, you're just shunting control to yet another third party.</p>
<p>My personal setup goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Raspberry Pi you bought but never used</li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li>Run FreshRSS</li>
<li>Add HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a> as an RSS feed</li>
<li>(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</li>
<li>(Optional) Pick out a smartphone app to sync with</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first thing that worked for me, so by no means is it the guaranteed best. Recommendations and alternatives are welcome! You can, of course, tailor the following guide if you'd like to use a VPS.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-the-pi">Prepare the Pi</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>
<p>Do a standard Raspbian setup the with <a href="https://soapstone.mradford.com/raspberry-pi-automatic-wifi-and-ssh">internet/ssh/hostname</a>. Then install git:</p>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install git
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h4>
<pre><span>curl -sSL</span><span> https://get.docker.com | </span><span>sh
</span></pre><pre><span>sudo</span><span> usermod</span><span> -aG</span><span> docker pi &amp;&amp; </span><span>sudo</span><span> reboot
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker-compose">Install Docker-compose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is specifically for Raspbian, if you're using a VPS or non-ARM machine, install docker-compose the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">conventional</a> way.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> libffi-dev libssl-dev
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> python3 python3-pip
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get remove python-configparser
</span><span>sudo</span><span> pip3 install docker-compose
</span></pre>
<pre><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS

cd FreshRSS/Docker
</span></pre>
<p>We're using a Raspberry Pi, so you'll need to pick out the ARM image! Use your favorite editor to modify these lines of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><span># docker-compose.yml
</span><span>-    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
</span><span>+    image: freshrss/freshrss:arm
</span></pre>
<p>Now you're ready to execute FreshRSS:</p>
<pre><span>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span> -d
</span></pre>
<p>Once that's complete, head to your Pi's IP address (or hostname, if you opted for that) on port <code>8080</code> in your laptop's/desktop's browser (something like http://1.2.3.4:8080), and go through the initial setup.</p>

<p>Add <code>https://hnrss.org/best</code> as an RSS feed (from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've officially RSS-ified HN!</p>
<h3 id="optional-port-forwarding-and-dns-setup">(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</h3>
<p>Unless you went with the VPS route, you're probably behind a LAN, so if you want to access your RSS outside your LAN, you'll need to set up port forwarding and/or DNS. That's beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many guides online that can get you there.</p>
<h3 id="optional-pick-out-an-app">(Optional) Pick out an app</h3>
<p>You could just expose the pi to the internet, and read RSS directly from the browser, but I think having an app is a nice touch.</p>
<p>First you'll need to enable API access in FreshRSS. Go to <code>Authentication</code> and check the box to allow API access:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-auth.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot1"></p>
<p>Then create an API key under <code>Profile</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-profile.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot2"></p>
<p>Now you can use the API url and the API key in your selected app to pull data down locally. Nice!</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of open-source (Android) apps to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readrops/Readrops">Readrops</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readrops.app">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/news-android">New Android</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.luhmer.owncloudnewsreader&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nilsbraden/ttrss-reader-fork">ttrss-reader-fork</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ttrssreader">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fistons/TinyTinyFeed">TinyTinyFeed</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.poopeeland.tinytinyfeed">play store</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, a lot of the closed source RSS apps I've checked out tend to be slightly higher in quality, so if you're willing to compromise on that front then they are worth exploring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-we-gain">What did we gain?</h2>
<p>It may not seem like it, but we've gained a <strong>lot</strong> by doing this!</p>

February 25, 2021 | https://rudderstack.com/blog/reverse-etl-is-just-another-data-pipeline | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rudderstack.com/blog/reverse-etl-is-just-another-data-pipeline">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Astasia from RedPoint Ventures wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/memory-leak/reverse-etl-a-primer-4e6694dcc7fb">great post</a> on new technologies supporting “reverse ETL” functionality in the customer data stack. </p>
<p>We’re excited to be innovating in the area of reverse ETL tech (via our Warehouse Actions feature) and our product and engineering teams discuss these topics and industry trends often, so we thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more technical depth on a few of Astasia’s points. </p>
<h2>1) Data Movement Differs Between Event Streams and Tabular Data, Which is an Important Consideration for Reverse ETL</h2>
<h3>Differences in Moving Data</h3>
<p>ETL/ELT solutions all accomplish a similar function, which is moving data, but there are several foundational differences to keep in mind when it comes to the data. One of those is the difference between <em>event stream data</em> and <em>tabular data</em>. </p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with this distinction on the ingestion side of the stack. Ingesting event streams is different from ingesting tabular data from SaaS applications (like Salesforce), not just in how the data is generated, i.e., pulled via API vs generated by an SDK, but also in the structure of the data itself. </p>
<p>This distinction has significant impacts, from real-time requirements to downstream reporting implications. This distinction has led to different vendors doing well in each category (i.e., Segment for event streaming and Fivetran for tabular data), but modern companies have to leverage both. </p>
<p>At RudderStack, we believe there is an opportunity to do both well, together. In fact, a unified stack to do both can achieve some interesting things, like cross-pipeline identity stitching (i.e., joining Salesforce record IDs with anonymousIDs) and unified data governance. We’re building these solutions at RudderStack, but that’s a topic for a different post. </p>
<h3>Event Stream vs. Tabular Data for Reverse ETL</h3>
<p>When you hear the term reverse ETL, it’s easy to think only of tabular data. The distinction still exists, though, and you can (and should) distinguish between event stream data and tabular data. </p>
<p>Astasia touched on a few use cases for tabular data, but reverse ETL as an event stream is equally as important. One use case we see quite often among our customers is sending events stored in logs (e.g., generated by your back end application and dumped into S3) into destinations like Google Analytics and Amplitude for analytics or platforms like Braze for marketing. </p>
<p>Many of our customers also perform more advanced processing like data mining or ML modeling of logs before sending them as events, then use RudderStack to pipe the data. </p>
<h2>2) Table Sync can be Modeled as an Event Stream</h2>
<p>An important point related to tabular vs event stream data is that tabular data can be modeled as events, but not necessarily the other way around. On the ETL/ELT side, CDC technologies (or incremental pulls) have generated quite a bit of interest because there are advantages of representing that data as events versus doing a batch pull via API. </p>
<p>Some of those advantages include incremental syncs for real-time updates, maintaining a consistent point-in-time state and routing the data to streaming technologies (we will covers this topic in more depth in a future post). </p>
<p>This is possible because <em>tabular data are actually a subset of event data</em>. In a similar way, batch processing is a subset of streaming processing. This means that tabular data can be derived from a stream of events and recreate the final state at any point (see event sourcing architecture). This is not true for the inverse, though. </p>
<p>In fact, the reason the industry adopted the tabular/batch model were primarily technical—it is much more difficult to build and manage streaming data, though this is changing with technologies like RudderStack. </p>
<p>At RudderStack, we have modeled table sync as an event stream in our reverse ETL solution. </p>
<p>At a high level, syncing a row from your warehouse to a ‘row’ in a cloud application is an “event” that specifies which data points are being mapped. Tools like Segment and RudderStack already accomplish that functionality with <code>.identify</code> calls in the event stream, so there is no inherent limitation of the data model for the use case. </p>
<p>So, while there are certainly different user experiences for streaming-based solutions like RudderStack vs table sync solutions like Census, they are primarily variations in UI/UX. </p>
<h2>3) The Limitations of Segment’s Personas Product for Reverse ETL</h2>
<p>Astasia made a great point about the distinction between reverse ETL and Segment’s Persona’s product. Personas is a powerful product feature, but it isn’t a reverse ETL solution. The reason is simple: Personas treats the user profile as a first-class object in data sync. The practical implication of this is that all data sync must conform to a contact/account structure, but as the recent increase in reverse ETL startups has shown, companies need sync functionality that serves a much wider range of use cases. </p>
<p>Reverse ETL as an event stream directly from the warehouse is unhindered by those limitations. In fact, with our Warehouse Actions feature, our customers can turn warehouse tables into a flexible, configurable event stream. That includes updating contacts, accounts and audiences, but can also support sending of cleansed internal events, derived proxy events (events represented by absence of behavior) and use cases where the data needs to be delivered to other infrastructure via tools like Kafka, Redis or HTTP endpoints. </p>
<h2>4) Reverse ETL is Still Just Data Movement, and a Single Pipe Simplifies Your Stack, Security, and Data governance</h2>
<p>Our mission at RudderStack is to help data engineers become the heroes of their companies by providing every team with rich data. We want to make their jobs easier, and part of that mission is simplifying data management into one pipeline. </p>
<p>In the modern stack, the warehouse is king and many destinations are also becoming sources (and vice versa!). </p>
<p>For example, sources of data often include </p>
<ul>
<li>Events coming from your client or server-side apps</li>
<li>Data from your SaaS tools</li>
<li>Data from your internal databases</li>
<li>Data from your warehouses and data lakes (and…lakehouses) </li>
<li>Data from internal event streams (like Kafka). </li>
</ul>
<p>When all of those sources are also destinations, almost every combination of source and destination is a use case, which create some important categories of tooling in the customer data stack: </p>
<ul>
<li>App to warehouse/SaaS (event streaming) </li>
<li>SaaS to warehouse (‘traditional’ ETL/ELT)</li>
<li>Warehouse to SaaS (new ‘reverse ETL’ category) </li>
<li>SaaS to SaaS (API to API category) </li>
</ul>
<p>Increasingly, those categories within the stack need to support important use cases that are becoming standard, but are still challenging for many companies to implement from a technical standpoint: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling customer-facing ML use-cases by sending live events to a key-value store (like Redis) for real-time personalization</li>
<li>Enabling internal ML use-cases by pulling data, enriching with ML, then sending it from the warehouse to tools for internal teams (i.e., Salesforce, Marketo, etc.)</li>
<li>Streaming internal events from Kafka to SaaS applications</li>
<li>Feeding transformed data (features) to feature stores (like Tecton)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you step back and look at those categories and the use cases they must support, it becomes clear that a business could easily have to build or buy a significant number of technologies to enable all of the functionality. In fact, we hear from companies all of the time about the pain of managing multiple technologies and vendors (which means contracts) across data pipelines. </p>

<p><em>“I think we have failed as technologists if we need to build different tools to load data into a warehouse and get data out of the warehouse. This is “focus on doing one thing well” and “you must create a new category” gone too far.”</em></p>
<p>We agree. Customers tell us all of the time that when it comes to managing pipelines in the context of the modern data stack, “best of breed” is becoming problematic to manage—after all, it’s the same customer data. </p>
<p>At RudderStack, we’re building the complete customer data stack for simplified pipeline management, including the reverse ETL component. </p>

So minimising downtime when transferring hosts is a pretty big deal.</p><p>Let's learn how to avoid downtime.</p><h2 id="step-1-transfer-your-content"><a href="#step-1-transfer-your-content" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>Step 1: Transfer your content</h2><p>The first step is to transfer your content to your new host, <strong>without turning off the old host</strong>. Your site on your old hosting provider doesn't have to be shutdown for you to start standing up your site on the new hosting provider.</p><p>Whether that's via a plugin, and manually copying your files across using FileZilla, or by getting a developer to copy your database to the new host, you need to have two copies of your site running to avoid downtime.</p><p>At the end of this step you should have two WordPress sites:</p><ol><li>The old one, which your domain is still pointing to (as in, visiting <a href="https://yoursite.com/">https://yoursite.com</a> still shows your WordPress site on your old hosting provider)</li><li>The new one, with a weird URL (depending on your new provider, this could be an IP address, or just a testing URL)</li></ol><h2 id="step-2-test-everything-on-your-new-site"><a href="#step-2-test-everything-on-your-new-site" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>Step 2: Test everything on your new site</h2><p>The last thing you want is to realise you forgot to copy your images <strong>after</strong> your site's users start visiting the new site.</p><p>Click around your new WordPress site, ensure images work, pages and posts are all there with the URLs you expect.</p><p>Once you're satisfied the new site works as you expect, you're ready to update your DNS</p><h2 id="step-3-update-your-dns-settings"><a href="#step-3-update-your-dns-settings" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>Step 3: Update your DNS settings</h2><p>This step will be different depending on your domain registrar (the company you bought the domain from), but the gist of it is that you're changing the address your domain points to from your old hosting provider, to the new one.</p><p>This step can take up to 72 hours for some old school providers, and can be as quick as a few minutes with AWS or CloudFlare. The time it takes is due to the DNS TTL values you use - you can read more about that <a href="https://ns1.com/resources/understanding-ttl-values-in-dns-records">here</a>. You can speed this step up by setting your TTL to a low value (like 300 seconds or 5 minutes) <strong>before you start the migration</strong>.</p><p>You can test whether the new hosting provider is live by creating a dummy blog post or page using the same URL you tested your new hosting provider with - if the post shows up at <a href="https://yoursite.com/">https://yoursite.com</a>, your new site is live!</p><p>Once you're <strong>absolutely sure</strong> your domain is displaying the WordPress site from your new hosting provider, <em>then</em> you can turn off the WordPress site running at your old hosting provider.</p><h2 id="how-does-this-prevent-downtime"><a href="#how-does-this-prevent-downtime" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>How does this prevent downtime?</h2><p>Essentially by not turning off either WordPress site, you entirely avoid downtime. When you switch the DNS records from the old hosting provider over to the new one, people visiting your site just start seeing the new site (since you don't turn off the old site until the migration is complete).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Nearly two years after releasing 1.0 Alpha 1, and after seven alpha releases,
            we are ready to bring EdgeDB to the public beta phase!</p>
<p>This means that as of now, we will make every effort to keep the public-facing
            APIs backwards compatible.  This includes EdgeQL, our standard library,
            schema definition language, official database clients’ APIs, even CLI
            commands and their options.  Most importantly, EdgeDB’s dumps made today
            will be restorable in future versions of the database.</p>
<p>This release completes a set of features we feel are crucial for
            a well-rounded 1.0 product, and we invite early adopters to try it out.
            On our end, we’re spending the next few months on getting EdgeDB ready
            for the first stable release.  Entering Beta means we won’t be adding
            new features until the release of 1.0 final.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/download">download</a> 1.0b1 in a number of ways or try it out
            in our <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install
            anything.</p>

<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database built
            on top of PostgreSQL which aims to <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/blog/a-path-to-a-10x-database">change the game</a> in terms
            of data layer usability and performance.</p>
<p>It combines an expressive object-oriented data model with a composable
            query language based on set logic, making complex data schemas easy to
            express, populate, and query.  The query system’s explicit goal is to
            address <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a>.</p>
<p>As a database designed for the long haul, EdgeDB allows for your data
            to evolve along with changing business needs, by providing built-in
            support for schema migrations.  It’s also developed in the open and
            under the permissive Apache license.</p>
<p>EdgeDB’s performance focus is embodied in its carefully designed
            first-party database clients (currently available for JavaScript, Go,
            and Python.)  The database server itself compiles EdgeQL queries to
            efficient SQL in ways that outperform many manually written queries.</p>
<p>As a modern database, EdgeDB also provides interoperability with your
            other services via built-in support for GraphQL, REST, and easy <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/api/connection#Connection.queryJSON">casting
                from and to JSON</a> while keeping your data strictly typed.</p>
<div id="built-in-database-migrations-in-use">

<p>We believe that managing the evolution of your data models is a crucial
                feature in a modern database product.  The alternatives would be either
                weakly typed schemas or a third-party product.  We’re not satisfied with
                either.  The former unnecessarily moves some of the responsibilities of
                the database into your application code, making data consistency harder
                and development more error-prone.  The latter on the other hand usually
                ties you to a particular database connection framework in a particular
                programming language, putting that language in a privileged position.
                This is suboptimal in today’s environment where very often mobile
                applications are written in multiple programming languages, a Web
                front-end can be another, and back-end processing using yet another.</p>
<p>With Beta 1, the migrations functionality we envisioned for EdgeDB
                is fully realized.  While you could <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/ddl/migrations">start, populate, and commit
                    migrations</a> from EdgeQL directly for a few releases
                already, now you can fully manage migrations from the CLI, making the
                workflow even more high-level.</p>
<p>The idea here is to be able to version your schema alongside your
                source code, possibly as a separate repository that you can link
                as a submodule in multiple applications that your system consists of.
                That repository would hold schema files describing migrations between
                different states of your data model.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say we start with the following schema for a simple
                chat app:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>module</span> <span>default</span> {
    <span>type</span> User {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> email <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> password_hash <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
    }

    <span>type</span> Message {
        <span>required</span> <span>link</span> author <span>-&gt;</span> User;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> body <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> timestamp <span>-&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span> {
            <span>default</span> <span>:=</span> <span>datetime_current</span>()
        }
    }
};</span></span></pre>
<p>The migration CLI looks for <code>.esdl</code> files in the <code>dbschema</code> directory
                by default, so let’s create one and write the above into a
                <code>dbschema/default.esdl</code> file inside it.  Let’s
                <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorial/install/">install</a> EdgeDB server and then create a new
                database instance for our chat app:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb server init chatapp</span></span></pre>
<p>Now, we can create the initial migration to the schema we’ve written above:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you create object type 'default::User'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>This is new, what do all those possible actions mean?  Let’s find out:</p>
<pre><span><span>?

y - confirm the prompt, use the DDL statements
n - reject the prompt
l - list the DDL statements associated with prompt
c - list already confirmed EdgeQL statements
b - revert back to previous save point, perhaps previous question
s - stop and save changes (splits migration into multiple)
q - quit without saving changes
h or ? - print help
did you create object type 'default::User'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>That’s clear, we did in fact create <code>User</code>. Let’s confirm:</p>
<pre><span><span>y
did you create object type 'default::Message'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Created dbschema/migrations/00001.edgeql, id:
m1ufwaxcqiwcq3ttcujnxv6f3jewhfrywc442z6gjk3sm3e5fgyr4q</span></span></pre>
<p>This creates the first migration file
                <code>dbschema/migrations/00001.edgeql</code>. After reviewing it to make
                sure everything is in order, we can apply the migration with the
                following command:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1ufwaxcqiwcq3ttcujnxv6f3jewhfrywc442z6gjk3sm3e5fgyr4q
(00001.edgeql)</span></span></pre>
<p>In the course of implementing our app we decide to add more features,
                such as a friends list and multiple chat channels, so we alter our
                schema to be:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>module</span> <span>default</span> {
    <span>type</span> User {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> email <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> password_hash <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;

        <span>multi</span> <span>link</span> friends <span>-&gt;</span> User;
    }

    <span>type</span> Message {
        <span>required</span> <span>link</span> author <span>-&gt;</span> User;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> body <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> timestamp <span>-&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span> {
            <span>default</span> <span>:=</span> <span>datetime_current</span>()
        }

        <span>link</span> channel <span>-&gt;</span> Channel;
    }

    <span>type</span> Channel {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> title <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span> {
            <span>constraint</span> <span>exclusive</span>;
        };
        <span>property</span> description <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
    }
};</span></span></pre>
<p>And we apply the changes by using <code>create-migration</code> and <code>migrate</code>
                commands again:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you create object type 'default::Channel'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
did you create link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'?
[y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
did you create link 'friends' of object type 'default::User'?
[y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Created dbschema/migrations/00002.edgeql, id:
m1kebitqygj3o75wvrnicnpwthinqsofb6hnpbnr7vrtjfynqelmzq
$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1kebitqygj3o75wvrnicnpwthinqsofb6hnpbnr7vrtjfynqelmzq
(00002.edgeql)</span></span></pre>
<p>At this point we may want to actually create a default channel “Main”
                and make the <code>channel</code> link required. So we alter the schema to make
                the link required and run <code>create-migration</code> again:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you make link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'
required? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>Indeed we did but for the sake of curiosity let’s list the DDL that
                the tool is producing for us here:</p>
<pre><span><span>l

Following DDL statements will be applied:
ALTER TYPE default::Message {
    ALTER LINK channel {
        SET REQUIRED USING (\(fill_expr));
    };
};</span></span></pre>
<p>Interestingly the DDL statement specifies that some expression will
                have to be provided to backfill data in the database.  Let’s see how
                it deals with this:</p>
<pre><span><span>did you make link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'
required? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Please specify an expression to populate existing objects in
order to make link 'channel' required:
fill_expr&gt; SELECT Channel FILTER .title = 'Main'
Created dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql, id:
m1wk64aoerkmvbdlurcxjxgbgv6c3xmuo3uz7pxc3gauyx4muysg6q</span></span></pre>
<p>However, before applying this migration we also add the line <code>INSERT
default::Channel {title := 'Main'};</code> at the beginning of the
                migration block in the <code>dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql</code> file
                to ensure the <code>SELECT</code> above finds the default channel.
                Now we can actually apply the changes:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
edgedb error: could not read migrations in dbschema/migrations:
could not read migration file dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql:
migration name should be
`m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba` but
`m1wk64aoerkmvbdlurcxjxgbgv6c3xmuo3uz7pxc3gauyx4muysg6q` is used
instead.
Migration names are computed from the hash of the migration
contents. To proceed you must fix the statement to read as:
  CREATE MIGRATION
  m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba ONTO ...
if this migration is not applied to any database. Alternatively,
revert the changes to the file.</span></span></pre>
<p>Uh-oh! The migration failed, but the error message actually explains
                what happened: the tool discovered we made manual changes to the file.
                Since this is deliberate, we just need to adjust the migration hash in
                order to proceed.  The tool even supplies us with the new hash. After
                adjusting the migration file, we can now apply it:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba</span></span></pre></div></section></article></div>

<p>
<span><i>ABSTRACT</i></span></p>


<p>
<span>Symbolic links make the Unix file system non-hierarchical, resulting in
multiple valid path names for a given file.
This ambiguity is a source of confusion, especially since some shells
work overtime to present a consistent view from programs such as
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>,
while other programs and
the kernel itself do nothing about the problem.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plan 9 has no symbolic links but it does have other mechanisms that produce the same difficulty.
Moreover, Plan 9 is founded on the ability to control a program’s environment
by manipulating its name space.
Ambiguous names muddle the result of operations such as copying a name space across
the network.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>To address these problems,
the Plan 9 kernel has been modified to maintain an accurate path name for every active
file (open file, working directory, mount table entry) in the system.
The definition of ‘accurate’ is that the path name for a file is guaranteed to be the rooted,
absolute name
the program used to acquire it.
These names are maintained by an efficient method that combines lexical processing—such as
evaluating
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>
by just removing the last path name element of a directory—with
local operations within the file system to maintain a consistently, easily understood view
of the name system.
Ambiguous situations are resolved by examining the lexically maintained names themselves.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>A new kernel call,
</span><span><tt>fd2path</tt></span><span>,
returns the file name associated with an open file,
permitting the use of reliable names to improve system
services ranging from
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
to debugging.
Although this work was done in Plan 9,
Unix systems could also benefit from the addition of
a method to recover the accurate name of an
open file or the current directory.
</span></p>




<p>
<span><b>Motivation
</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Consider the following unedited transcript of a session running the Bourne shell on a modern
Unix system:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;echo&nbsp;$HOME</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;$HOME</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>../rob:&nbsp;bad&nbsp;directory</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>(The same output results from running
</span><span><tt>tcsh</tt></span><span>;
we’ll discuss
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>
in a moment.)
To a neophyte being schooled in the delights of a hierarchical file name space,
this behavior must be baffling.
It is, of course, the consequence of a series of symbolic links intended to give users
the illusion they share a disk, when in fact their files are scattered over several devices:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ls&nbsp;-ld&nbsp;/home/rob&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>lrwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;root&nbsp;&nbsp;sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;26&nbsp;&nbsp;1998&nbsp;/home/ken&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>lrwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;root&nbsp;&nbsp;sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp;1998&nbsp;/home/rob&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>The introduction of symbolic links has changed the Unix file system from a true
hierarchy into a directed graph, rendering
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>
ambiguous and sowing confusion.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Unix popularized hierarchical naming, but the introduction of symbolic links
made its naming irregular.
Worse, the
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
command, through the underlying
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
library routine,
uses a tricky, expensive algorithm that often delivers the wrong answer.
Starting from the current directory,
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
opens the parent,
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>,
and searches it for an entry whose i-number matches the current directory;
the matching entry is the final path element of the ultimate result.
Applying this process iteratively,
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
works back towards the root.
Since
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
knows nothing about symbolic links, it will recover surprising names for
directories reached by them,
as illustrated by the example;
the backward paths
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
traverses will not backtrack across the links.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Partly for efficiency and partly to make
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
more predictable, the Korn shell
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>
[Korn94]
implements
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
as a builtin.
(The
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
command must be a builtin in any shell, since the current directory is unique to each process.)
</span><span><tt>Ksh</tt></span><span>
maintains its own private view of the file system to try to disguise symbolic links;
in particular,
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
involve some lexical processing (somewhat like the
</span><span><tt>cleanname</tt></span><span>
function discussed later
in this paper), augmented by heuristics such as examining the environment
for names like
</span><span><tt>$HOME</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>$PWD</tt></span><span>
to assist initialization of the state of the private view. [Korn00]
</span></p>
<p>
<span>This transcript begins with a Bourne shell running:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>This result is encouraging.  Another example, again starting from a Bourne shell:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>../ken:&nbsp;bad&nbsp;directory</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>By doing extra work,
the Korn shell is providing more sensible behavior,
but it is easy to defeat:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;exit</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>In these examples,
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>’s
built-in
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
failed to produce the results
(</span><span><tt>/home/rob/bin</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>/home/ken</tt></span><span>)
that the previous example might have led us to expect.
The Korn shell is hiding the problem, not solving it, and in fact is not even hiding it very well.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>A deeper question is whether the shell should even be trying to make
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
do a better job.
If it does, then the
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
library call and every program that uses it will behave differently from the shell,
a situation that is sure to confuse.
Moreover, the ability to change directory to
</span><span><tt>../ken</tt></span><span>
with the Korn shell’s
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
command but not with the
</span><span><tt>chdir</tt></span><span>
system call is a symptom of a diseased system, not a healthy shell.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The operating system should provide names that work and make sense.
Symbolic links, though, are here to stay, so we need a way to provide
sensible, unambiguous names in the face of a non-hierarchical name space.
This paper shows how the challenge was met on Plan 9, an operating system
with Unix-like naming.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Names in Plan 9
</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Except for some details involved with bootstrapping, file names in Plan 9 have the same syntax as in Unix.
Plan 9 has no symbolic links, but its name space construction operators,
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>,
make it possible to build the same sort of non-hierarchical structures created
by symbolically linking directories on Unix.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plan 9’s
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
system call takes a file descriptor
and attaches to the local name space the file system service it represents:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>mount(fd,&nbsp;"/dir",&nbsp;flags)</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>Here
</span><span><tt>fd</tt></span><span>
is a file descriptor to a communications port such as a pipe or network connection;
at the other end of the port is a service, such as file server, that talks 9P, the Plan 9 file
system protocol.
After the call succeeds, the root directory of the service will be visible at the
</span><span><i>mount point</i></span><span>
</span><span><tt>/dir</tt></span><span>,
much as with the
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
call of Unix.
The
</span><span><tt>flag</tt></span><span>
argument specifies the nature of the attachment:
</span><span><tt>MREPL</tt></span><span>
says that the contents of the root directory (appear to) replace the current contents of
</span><span><tt>/dir</tt></span><span>;
</span><span><tt>MAFTER</tt></span><span>
says that the current contents of
</span><span><tt>dir</tt></span><span>
remain visible, with the mounted directory’s contents appearing
</span><span><i>after</i></span><span>
any existing files;
and
</span><span><tt>MBEFORE</tt></span><span>
says that the contents remain visible, with
the mounted directory’s contents appearing
</span><span><i>before</i></span><span>
any existing files.
These multicomponent directories are called
</span><span><i>union directories</i></span><span>
and are somewhat different from union directories in 4.4BSD-Lite [PeMc95], because
only the top-level directory itself is unioned, not its descendents, recursively.
(Plan 9’s union directories are used differently from 4.4BSD-Lite’s, as will become apparent.)
</span></p>
<p>
<span>For example, to bootstrap a diskless computer the system builds a local name space containing
only the root directory,
</span><span><tt>/</tt></span><span>,
then uses the network to open a connection
to the main file server.
It then executes
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>mount(rootfd,&nbsp;"/",&nbsp;MREPL);</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>After this call, the entire file server’s tree is visible, starting from the root of the local machine.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>While
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
connects a new service to the local name space,
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
rearranges the existing name space:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("tofile",&nbsp;"fromfile",&nbsp;flags)</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>causes subsequent mention of the
</span><span><tt>fromfile</tt></span><span>
(which may be a plain file or a directory)
to behave as though
</span><span><tt>tofile</tt></span><span>
had been mentioned instead, somewhat like a symbolic link.
(Note, however, that the arguments are in the opposite order
compared to
</span><span><tt>ln</tt></span><span>
</span><span><tt>-s</tt></span><span>).
The
</span><span><tt>flags</tt></span><span>
argument is the same as with
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>As an example, a sequence something like the following is done at bootstrap time to
assemble, under the single directory
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>,
all of the binaries suitable for this architecture, represented by (say) the string
</span><span><tt>sparc</tt></span><span>:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("/sparc/bin",&nbsp;"/bin",&nbsp;MREPL);</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("/usr/rob/sparc/bin",&nbsp;"/bin",&nbsp;MAFTER);</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>This sequence of
</span><span><tt>binds</tt></span><span>
causes
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>
to contain first the standard binaries, then the contents of
</span><span><tt>rob</tt></span><span>’s
private SPARC binaries.
The ability to build such union directories
obviates the need for a shell
</span><span><tt>$PATH</tt></span><span>
variable
while providing opportunities for managing heterogeneity.
If the system were a Power PC, the same sequence would be run with
</span><span><tt>power</tt></span><span>
textually substituted for
</span><span><tt>sparc</tt></span><span>
to place the Power PC binaries in
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>
rather than the SPARC binaries.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Trouble is already brewing.  After these bindings are set up,
where does
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;..</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>set the current working directory, to
</span><span><tt>/</tt></span><span>
or
</span><span><tt>/sparc</tt></span><span>
or
</span><span><tt>/usr/rob/sparc</tt></span><span>?
We will return to this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>There are some important differences between
</span><span><tt>binds</tt></span><span>
and symbolic links.
First,
symbolic links are a static part of the file system, while
Plan 9 bindings are created at run time, are stored in the kernel,
and endure only as long as the system maintains them;
they are temporary.
Since they are known to the kernel but not the file system, they must
be set up each time the kernel boots or a user logs in;
permanent bindings are created by editing system initialization scripts
and user profiles rather than by building them in the file system itself.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Plan 9 kernel records what bindings are active for a process,
whereas symbolic links, being held on the Unix file server, may strike whenever the process evaluates
a file name.
Also, symbolic links apply to all processes that evaluate the affected file, whereas
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
has a local scope, applying only to the process that executes it and …</span></p></div>

<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chinopdsimmons/photos/crime-analyst-green-at-the-helm-of-our-real-time-crime-center/125426665468061/">Source: Chino Chief of Police</a></em></p>
</center>

<p dir="ltr">Over the last two decades, law enforcement agencies across the United States have been obtaining more and more sophisticated surveillance technologies to collect data. Technologies such as networked cameras, automated license plate readers, and gunshot detection are deployed around the clock, as are the tools to process this data, such as predictive policing software and AI-enhanced video analytics. The last five years have seen a distinct trend in which police have begun deploying all of this technology in conjunction with one another. The technologies, working in concert, are being consolidated and fed into physical locations called Real-Time Crime Centers (RTCCs). These high-tech hubs, filled with walls of TV monitors and computer workstations for sworn officers and civilian analysts, not only exploit huge amounts of data, but also are used to justify an increase in surveillance technology through new "data-driven" or "intelligence-led" policing strategies.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As part of the Atlas of Surveillance project, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and students from the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno have identified more than 80 RTCCs across the United States, with heavy concentrations in the South and the Northeast. In this report, we highlight the capabilities and controversies surrounding 7 of these facilities. As this trend expands, it is crucial that the public understands how the technologies are combined to collect data about people as they move through their day-to-day lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs are similar to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/why-fusion-centers-matter-faq#:~:text=about%20fusion%20centers%3F-,What%20are%20fusion%20centers%3F,who%20analyze%20and%20share%20intelligence.">Fusion Centers</a>, to the extent the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. We distinguish between the two: fusion centers are technology command centers that function on a larger regional level, are typically controlled by a state-level organization, and are formally part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's fusion center network. They also focus on distributing information about national security "threats," which are often broadly interpreted. RTCCs are generally focused on municipal or county level activities and focus on a general spectrum of public safety issues, from car thefts to gun crime to situational awareness at public events.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The term “real-time” is also somewhat misleading: while there is often a focus on accessing data in real-time to communicate to first responders, many law enforcement agencies use RTCC to mine historical data to make decisions about the future through "predictive policing," a controversial and largely unproven strategy to identify places where crime could occur or people who might commit crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<center>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="A map of the United States with small, orange circles representing real-time crime centers." src="https://atlasofsurveillance.org/files/pictures/12/content_RTCC_MAP.png"></p>
</center>

<p dir="ltr">So far, the Atlas of Surveillance project has identified RTCCs in 29 states, with the highest number in Florida (14) and New York (11); however, Mississippi also stood out with four RTCCs despite being a significantly smaller state. While RTCCs are commonly found in large metropolitan areas, even smaller cities such as Ogden, Utah and Hampton, Virginia have established their own RTCCs. There may be more RTCCs yet to be discovered. In Denver, local officials and news organizations were unaware the Denver Police Department had <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/denver-police-quietly-expand-surveillance-camera-network/73-80b180c4-2456-4a28-b106-feb1831ea61f">launched an RTCC </a>and expanded its camera network until Atlas of Surveillance researchers uncovered a job advertisement outlining its capabilities. The Honolulu Police Department has added a RTCC to its <a href="http://206.195.188.21/downloads/HPD_Moving_Forward.pdf">2020-2022 strategic plan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs tend to share common defining technological features, the most prominent being access to a <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/surveillance-cameras">surveillance camera network</a> with feeds that are broadcast live onto a wall of TV monitors within a centralized headquarters. The number of cameras can range from just a few hundred, as in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to more than 12,000, as in Atlanta, Georgia, but in all cases the number of cameras have been steadily growing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs also go hand-in-hand with <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/gunshot-detection">gunshot detection technology</a>, especially ShotSpotter, a company that installs sensors throughout neighborhoods in order to listen for and locate suspected gunfire. The majority of RTCCs also tap into <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr">automated license plate readers</a> (ALPRs) to track and get real-time alerts on the locations of vehicles. In addition, RTCC staff typically have access to a variety of criminal justice databases and monitor social media feeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The starting cost of these RTCCs can range dramatically, from just a few hundred thousand dollars to as much as $11 million, as in New York City. This funding can come from a number of sources, including city budgets, voter-approved bonds, state and federal grants, private institutions, and wealthy individual donors. For example, the Atlanta Loudermilk Operation Shield Video Integration Center started with a $1-million donation from the Loudermilk family, who are real-estate developers, as well as $350,000 from the city. The price tag proved too high for the Fresno Police Department in California, which let go of its <a href="https://gvwire.com/2020/07/09/conservative-appointee-lasts-just-15-hours-on-fresno-immigrant-rights-committee/">part-time RTCC staff in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.fresno.gov/finance/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/06/TRAY-MEMO-Response-to-Council-Direction-No.-41-Request-Audit-of-Video-Policing-Surveillance-Unit-6.18.20.pdf">ceased all real-time operations</a> at the RTCC in 2020 (although police can still access stored footage from previously installed cameras after crimes occur).&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Yet the cost barrier for these systems is steadily dropping. Based at the University of New Orleans, a private organization called <a href="https://www.projectnola.org/">Project NOLA</a> provides subsidized cameras and other technologies to cities and provides virtual RTCC software to municipalities through its NOLA National Real-Time Crime Center. So far, Project NOLA has partnered with police departments in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Alabama, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Source: <a href="https://cvp.newarkpublicsafety.org/">New Jersey "Citizens Virtual Patrol"</a></p>
</center>

<p dir="ltr">Funding isn't the only way that RTCCs blur the line between public and private surveillance. The Newark, New Jersey RTCC encourages citizens to view live video feeds from cameras across the city through its "<a href="https://cvp.newarkpublicsafety.org/">Citizen Virtual Patrol</a>" program. Meanwhile, police in Jackson, Mississippi began testing a new system to link doorbell cameras, including Amazon’s Ring, to their RTCC. Similar camera sharing programs are being promoted in <a href="https://www.wtxl.com/news/lcso-unveils-new-real-time-crime-center/article_af42e61c-f35a-11e8-a32d-2bd5dc910bb2.html">Leon County, Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.safecamnola.com/">New Orleans</a>.</p>

<p>The increasing computation time and cost highlight the importance of inventing computationally efficient models that retain top modeling power with reduced or accelerated computation.</p>
<p>The Transformer <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architecture</a> was proposed to accelerate model training in NLP. Specifically, it is built entirely upon self-attention and avoids the use of recurrence. The rationale of this design choice, as mentioned in the original work, is to enable strong parallelization (by utilizing the full power of GPUs and TPUs). In addition, the attention mechanism is an extremely powerful component that permits efficient modeling of variable-length inputs. These advantages have made Transformer an expressive and efficient unit, and as a result, the predominant architecture for NLP.</p>
<p>A couple of interesting questions arises following the development of Transformer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is attention all we need for modeling?</li>
<li>If recurrence is not a compute bottleneck, can we find better architectures?</li>
</ul>
<h6>SRU++ and related work</h6>
<p>We present SRU++ as a possible answer to the above question. The inspiration of SRU++ comes from two lines of research:</p>
<p>First, previous works have tackled the parallelization/speed problem of RNNs and proposed various fast recurrent networks [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10</a>]. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quasi-RNN</a> and Simple Recurrent Unit (<a href="https://github.com/asappresearch/sru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SRU</a>), both are highly-parallelizable RNNs. <strong>The advance eliminates the need of eschewing recurrences to trade training efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, several recent works have achieved strong results by leveraging recurrence in conjunction with self-attention. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merity</a> (2019) demonstrated a single-headed attention LSTM (<a href="https://github.com/Smerity/sha-rnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHA-LSTM</a>) is sufficient to achieve competitive results on character-level language modeling task while requiring significantly less training time. In addition, RNNs have been incorporated into Transformer architectures, resulting in better results on machine translation and natural language understanding tasks [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12</a>]. <strong>These results suggest that recurrence and attention are complementary at sequence modeling</strong>.</p>
<p>In light of the previous research, we enhance the modeling capacity of SRU by incorporating self-attention as part of the architecture. A simple illustration of the resulting architecture SRU++ is shown in Figure 1c.</p>

<p>SRU++ replaces the linear mapping of the input (Figure 1a) by first projecting the input into a smaller dimension. An attention operation is then applied, followed by a residual connection. The dimension is projected back to the hidden size needed by the elementwise recurrence operation of SRU. In addition, not every SRU++ layer needs attention. When the attention is disabled in SRU++, the network reduces to a SRU variant using dimension reduction to reduce the number of parameters (Figure 1b).</p>
<h6>Results</h6>
<p><strong>1. SRU++ is a highly-efficient neural architecture</strong><br>
We evaluate SRU++ on several language modeling benchmarks such as Enwik8 dataset. Compared to Transformer models such as Transformer-XL, SRU++ can achieve similar results using only a fraction of the resources. Figure 2 compares the training efficiency between the two with directly comparable training settings. SRU++ is 8.7x more efficient to surpass the dev result of Transformer-XL, and 5.1x more efficient to reach a BPC (bits-per-character) of 1.17.</p>

<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p>We present a recurrent architecture with optional built-in self-attention that achieves leading model capacity and training efficiency. We demonstrate that highly expressive and efficient models can be derived using a combination of attention and fast recurrence. Our results reaffirm the empirical observations that attention is not all we need, and can be complemented by other sequential modeling modules.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In 1872, a fire broke out in the basement of a warehouse on Summer Street in Boston. As flames spread to nearby buildings, Boston firefighters called for backup. Neighboring towns responded, only to discover that their hoses would not fit into the hydrants. The couplings that connect the hydrants to the hoses had not been standardized. This hampered the help the firefighters could give, and thirty people died. 776 buildings burned. Fast forward to 2021. Companies and governments are trying to share information about vaccine appointments. Their systems cannot connect with each other. People cannot get shots. The death toll is ongoing. History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</p>

<p>Why is government struggling to make a working vaccine registration website? Building software is challenging and requires experts to direct it. Massachusetts lacks professional development opportunities for its staff to develop the skills required to build modern software. Finally the government has yet to take leadership in establishing standards for the exchange of data within itself, never mind among a federation of private companies to which it delegated vaccine appointment responsibility.</p>

<p>Buying and building software is hard, which is why <a href="https://github.com/18F/technology-budgeting/blob/master/handbook.md#hire-tech-talent-in-house">agencies and budget offices need to hire technical talent in-house</a>. An agency in Massachusetts might have in-house lawyers to handle complex legal issues, but complex technical procurements are left to staff that have never written a line of code. Without that experience it is hard to spot issues and understand the effort required to undertake a task. Asking a software vendor whether they can do a particular thing is like asking a car salesman whether you need a new car: the answer will always be yes. We need experts who can tell us whether we <em>should</em> do a particular thing and <em>how</em> it should be done. Having technical talent at the table will make sure the right questions are being asked throughout the software procurement and oversight process.</p>

<p>Public servants succeed despite chronic underfunding of their efforts. You would be shocked at the leanness of the public sector. It makes the private sector look bloated. Responsibilities that might be an entire department at Google fall upon one or two state or municipal employees. Apple has Apple University to help its employees learn new skills. For public sector employees everything is learned on the fly and on your own. The Government of the United Kingdom has established the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gds-academy-course-descriptions">Government Digital Services Academy</a> to teach its public servants digital skills and techniques. We should do this in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Finally the Commonwealth should establish a Data Standards Authority, modeled after the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/data-standards-authority">same authority in the United Kingdom</a>. Standards are how we can have data couplings that let state agencies and municipalities talk with each other. As the Commonwealth adopts standards, the private sector will see this leadership and learn what it needs to do to share information on anything from vaccine appointments to construction plans. We can make sure when the next crises arrives, we can work together.</p>

<p>These steps would merely be a down payment on the work required to modernize state government. To make this work the state needs to successfully recruit, train, and retain product managers, designers, and developers in agencies across the Commonwealth. These individuals need to reflect the diversity of our community, and build their tools with empathy and understanding of existing people and ways. It will not happen overnight, but no place is better equipped to do this than Massachusetts.</p>

	<p>
In an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection">isometric</a>
display, it can be tricky to draw boxes of various sizes in the correct order
to keep them appropriately in front of or behind one another.  The figure below
shows an example.  The blue box should be drawn first, then green, then red.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure1a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure1b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 1: The boxes on the left are <u>not</u> drawn in the correct order, whereas the
boxes on the right are drawn correctly.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We will explore a simple solution for determining the correct order to draw a
given set of boxes.  But first, we must define what we mean by <em>boxes</em>.
	</p>

	<h3>What do we mean by <em>boxes</em>?</h3>

	<p>
We define boxes as <em>axis-aligned</em> and <em>non-intersecting</em>
rectangular prisms. Take a look at the above Figure 1 again.  Each box is
parallel to the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axis (i.e.
axis-aligned).  Also, note that the boxes are next to each other but do not
intersect.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine if boxes overlap on screen.</h3>

	<p>
First of all, if two boxes do not overlap on the screen, then we do not have to
worry about which one is drawn first.  This is the first test we must perform,
which we explore in this section.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure2a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure2b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 2: No overlap on the left; overlap on the right.  (Note: we are talking
about overlap on screen, not intersection in space.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The silhouettes of the 3D boxes become 2D hexagons in the isometric view, as seen below.  We use the
outline of these silhouettes to test for overlap.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure3a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure3b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 3: The box silhouettes in an isometric view are simple hexagons.  Note
that their sides are always parallel to the vertical and two diagonal axes.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We take advantage of the fact that the hexagon sides are always parallel to
some axis.  This allows us to easily determine if the hexagons overlap by
checking for intersection of their regions on each axis.  We add an <em>h</em>
(horizontal) axis to help.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure4a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure4b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
The red and blue boxes do not overlap on the h axis, therefore they do not overlap.
The green and blue boxes do overlap since their region on every axis overlap.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
Now that we have outlined our concept for <em>determining if two boxes overlap
on the screen</em>, we will fill in the details necessary for implementing it.
	</p>

	<p>
The act of flattening the 3D box into a 2D hexagon involves getting rid of the
Z coordinate.  Notice that increasing a point's Z coordinate by 1 is the same
as incrementing both X and Y coordinates by 1.  Thus, we can add Z to both X
and Y and drop Z completely.  Shown below is the source code for a function
that performs this conversion.
	</p>

<code>
<span>function</span> spaceToIso(spacePos) <span>{</span>

    
    <span>var</span> isoX = spacePos.x + spacePos.z;
    <span>var</span> isoY = spacePos.y + spacePos.z;

    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        x: isoX,
        y: isoY,

        
        h: (isoX - isoY) * Math.cos(Math.PI/6),

        
        v: (isoX + isoY) / 2;
    <span>}</span>;
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
And finally, after determining the bounds of each hexagon, we can determine if
they overlap by using the source code below.
	</p>

<code><span>function</span> doHexagonsOverlap(hex1, hex2) <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> (

        
        !(hex1.xmin &gt;= hex2.xmax || hex2.xmin &gt;= hex1.xmax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.ymin &gt;= hex2.ymax || hex2.ymin &gt;= hex1.ymax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.hmin &gt;= hex2.hmax || hex2.hmin &gt;= hex1.hmax));
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
Now that we have determined if two boxes overlap on the screen, we can begin exploring how to determine which box is in front of the other.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine which box is in front.</h3>

	<p>
Recall that our boxes do not intersect each other. we can visualize their separation
as a thin plane between them (see Figure 5 below).  After identifying this
plane, we can determine which box is in front by selecting the one on the
correct side of this plane.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure5a" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5b" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5c" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 5: A pair of blocks can be separated in one of three ways shown here.
The dark glass illustrates this separation.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We can find this plane of separation by looking at each axis individually.  In
particular, we look for an axis which has non-intersecting box ranges (see
Figure 6 below).
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure6a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure6b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 6: On the left, the blocks are separated on the y-axis.  On the right,
the blocks are separated on the x-axis. (The z-axis is omitted for simplicity.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
In Figure 6 above, we have chosen a coordinate system which make lesser values
of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to be closer to the camera.  Though not shown, the
<em>z</em> axis is positive in the up direction, so a greater value makes it
closer to the camera.
	</p>

	<p>
The following is a javascript function for determining if the first block is in
front of the second:
	</p>

	<code><span>function</span> isBoxInFront(box1, box2) <span>{</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.xmin &gt;= box2.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.xmin &gt;= box1.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.ymin &gt;= box2.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.ymin &gt;= box1.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.zmin &gt;= box2.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.zmin &gt;= box1.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code>

	<h3>Draw boxes in the correct order.</h3>

	<p>
In general, <u>a box should not be drawn until all the ones behind it are
drawn</u>.  Thus, we begin by drawing the boxes that have nothing behind them.
Then, we can draw the boxes that are only in front of those that are already
drawn. This process continues until all boxes are drawn. (See Figure 4 below
for an example.)
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure7" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 4: (1) Nothing is behind blue, so draw it first. (2) Draw green next
since blue was the only one behind it and is already drawn.  (3) Then draw red,
since both blocks that were behind it have been drawn.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
To implement this algorithm, each box must know exactly which boxes are behind
it.  We have already determined how to do this in the last section.  A search
must be implemented so that each box has a list of boxes behind it.
	</p>

	<p>
You are now armed with everything you need to know to render isometric boxes in
the correct order.
	</p>

	<h3>A conundrum</h3>

	<p>
It is possible to have a situation seen in the figure below.  The aforementioned drawing
methods dictate that we first draw the box with nothing behind it, but this example illustrates
a case where this cannot be done.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure8" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Here are three boxes intertwined in a way such that one is always behind
another.  This prevents us from drawing a first box.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The figure above cheats by segmenting the orange box into two.
This is one method of breaking this type of cycle.
	</p>

	<p>
There are formal methods used for detecting
such cycles mentioned in the appendix.  After detection of a cycle, the blocks in that cycle
could be drawn with special clipping regions to respect front boxes or to segment a block or blocks
that will break the cycle.  These are solutions that I will be exploring and updating this article as
my experiments progress.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>Appendix</h2>

	<h4>A formal description of the solution</h4>

	<p>
This is a special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm">Painter's Algorithm</a>,
which handles occlusion by drawing back-to-front.
	</p>

	<p>
For those who are interested, our method for determining if hexagons and boxes
are overlapping is a result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem">hyperplane separation theorem</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Also, the way in which we determined the drawing order of the boxes is known in graph theory as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>,
which is essentially a depth-first search of a directed graph.
	</p>

	<p>
You can build a directed graph of the <em>boxes</em>, with directed edges to
the boxes that are behind it.  Topologically sorting this graph will produce an
ordered list of boxes that can be drawn in that exact order.
	</p>

	<p>
Mathematicians will recognize this directed graph as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered
set</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Finally, to prevent the aforementioned cycle conundrum, we can use <a href="">Tarjan's
strongly connection components</a> algorithm.  After computing these cycles,
one could either split a block to prevent a cycle, or to use a clipping region
to prevent drawing over any blocks that are supposed to be in front of it.
	</p>

	<h4>Alternative Solutions</h4>

	<p>
You may be able to just use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">Z-buffering</a>,
though drawing order is still important for transparent sprites.  Also, if all
bounding boxes are unit cubes, sorting is much simpler.
	</p>

	<h4>Full example of working code</h4>

	<p>
All the diagrams above were created using a simple isometric box renderer
written in Javascript, which applies all the techniques described in this
article.  You can study the fully annotated source code on <a href="https://github.com/shaunew/IsometricBlocks">IsometricBlocks project on
GitHub</a>.

<p>
Well, it's been a year since I started the draft, so I guess it's about time to publish this! :)
</p>
<p>
This is a map of my personal <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a> <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a>, with links to the scripts and tools used; and my blog posts elaborating on different parts of it.
</p>
<p>
My goal for data liberation is approximating the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#data_mirror">'personal data mirror'</a> concept,
often <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">despite</a> crappy interoperability (or lack thereof) of different platforms.
</p>
<p>
I prepared this diagram for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to give more context for my blog posts about data liberation and tools around it</li>
<li>to highlight the complexity and hoops we have to jump over because of the lack of interoperability</li>
<li>it was also sort of fun :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This time I won't write too much text and just let you explore it. <b>Tips for exploring the diagram</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps open the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra_files/myinfra.svg"><b>full size SVG</b></a> in a new tab</li>
<li>make sure to read the legend</li>
<li>links you can follow are marked with blue (and sometimes other colours)</li>
<li>there is a bubble (💬) near some nodes/edges, you can hover it to see the comment</li>
<li>some integrations are in progress: marked with <samp>WIP</samp>, construction signs (🚧🚧) and dashed edges</li>
<li>arrows roughly represent the direction of data flow</li>
<li>arrow colors roughly correspond to the data source (so it's easier to track how it flows)</li>
<li>there are some rendering issues

Some <b>notes</b> regarding the diagram:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it's plotted via graphviz, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/myinfra">here</a> (although the code is quite domain specific)</li>
<li>even though there is a lot of stuff on the diagram, it's still incomplete!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html">here</a> there is an (also incomplete) list of data I collect/export</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/tree/master/my">HPI modules</a> are a good proxy for the data I'm using</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
note that despite some platforms dying (e.g. Jawbone/Endomondo), I can still use data produced with them!
</p>
<p>
E.g. after Endomondo was discontinued, I was able to quickly switch to open source <a href="https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup#readme">RunnerUp app</a>,
while <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/5b501d156266ca8e185d681fab6bc3ee156498a6/my/runnerup.py">preserving</a> complete data compatibility.
</p></li>
<li>note how many services are outright malicious with their <b>anti-API/anti-scraping/anti-interoperability</b> measures (yellow/red highlight for API nodes)</li>
<li>probably more platforms have GDPR exports, I just haven't tried yet</li>
<li><p>
indirection is crazy
</p>
<p>
Note how for some data, before I can get it on my computer, it goes as

for many phone apps <b>the only way</b> I can sync the data is <b>by rooting my phone</b> in order to access the <code>/data/data</code> directory

<p>
This is getting worse and worse with every Android version. I understand the security concerns, but this is ridiculous.
</p></li>
<li><p>
some modules/packages (marked with<sup>sb</sup> superscript) were developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge">Sean Breckenridge</a>
</p>
<p>
He's forked my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package and working on it <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI">in parallel</a>.
For now, we decided to hack on it independently, in the hope that eventually we figure out what's a good model for cooperating and maintaining the modules.

<p>Modelling methodologies aim to approximate how real-world situations evolve over time. A successful model is created with a system of parameters and rules that most likely represent a ‘real’ situation. The ‘real’ situation then incorporates natural variation in multiple repeated scenarios, thereby returning a distribution of results. This allows analysts to identify how the system could respond to changes in factors, without the need to carry out  either lengthy experiments or constructions in the real world. </p>



<p><em>Agent-based modelling</em> is one such methodology that has more recently benefited by both advances in software and processing technology, and the availability of cloud computing (such as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GCP</a>), making its application more accessible.</p>



<p>My goal in this blog-post is to run through the foundations of <em>agent-based modelling</em>. I will illustrate how it can be used to model real-world situations by creating a not so real-world example, one of a <em>zombie outbreak</em>. We have all probably seen one (if not more) zombie movies, so the situation I describe here will be somewhat familiar and (hopefully) it will be a bit of fun.</p>



<h2>What is Agent-based Modelling?</h2>



<p>The definition according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model#:~:text=Agent%2Dbased%20models%20are%20a,the%20sum%20of%20its%20parts%22." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;for <em>agent-based modelling</em> is:</p>



<blockquote><p>An agent-based model (ABM) is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole.</p><cite>– Wikipedia definition</cite></blockquote>



<p>Modelling how a system both is and then changes over time under certain interventions can be helpful when investigating which ones to implement in a real-world situation. In the case of <em>agent-based modelling</em>, the actions of individual agents are simulated over a set period. Analyses and scenarios can be modeled on the individual agents, or at different levels of aggregation, to better understand the overall benefit or consequence to the system.</p>



<p><em>Agent-based modelling</em> is popular in various domains. It is used extensively in Biology to analyse the spread of epidemics, the impacts of stochastic gene expression, changes to ecology, cognitive function deltas and immune system responses. In Epidemiology, it has been deployed to inform public health outcomes for COVID-19 transmission and hospitalizations.  In Business and Economics, it has been for supply chain optimization and logistics, consumer behaviours and economic outcome analysis due to the ability to simulate the complexity of a market.</p>



<p>The nature of simulating each individual agent and repeating the simulation multiple times, is the reason why agent-based modelling can require significant processing power.  In recent times, a simulation may require the procurement of both high powered computing and specialized software, or one must have a comprehensive understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP),(often%20known%20as%20methods)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Object-oriented Programming</a> (OOP) to create a model. Nowadays, there are numerous open source libraries for creating your own <em>agent-based model</em>, such as <a href="https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mesa</a> for python, and most desktop computers can handle the required processing and storage. </p>



<p>To explain <em>Agent-based modelling</em>, I will break it down into 4 components: agents, actions, environment and simulation.</p>

<h3>Agent</h3>



<p>Agents are the singular elements of the model which can make decisions, act autonomously, and interact with other agents. An agent can be an individual or group of individuals, just as long as the defined agent is able to behave as a singular entity.</p>



<p>Each agent is set up with <em>distinct attributes</em> which drives how they behave within the system. Agent behaviour encompasses the decision making and how this could lead to specific actions. Rules in the model determine how an agent with a set of attributes will exhibit a particular type of behaviour. These rules can be as simple as: if agent has Attribute A then exhibit Behaviour A. For example, if agent is a zombie then behave like a zombie. These rules can also include how an intervention may alter the agent’s decision making.</p>



<h3>Actions</h3>



<p>Actions are the materialisation of agent decision-making which lead to a <em>change in the system</em>. The changes could affect only the individual agent performing the action or include other agents and the environment. Impacts of actions can include movement or change in agent attributes.</p>



<p>Actions involving more than one agent or agents and the environment are called interactions. These are the most important type of actions for agent-based modelling because they represent how information can be transferred between individuals or how behaviours can be changed by interventions.</p>



<p>Continuing my example above, zombie behaviour is defined by two actions: hunting humans and eating human brains. Hunting a human is a movement action and eating human brains is an interaction. Interaction is only triggered if the zombie and human are sufficiently close, and the human becomes a zombie because of this interaction.</p>



<h3>Environment</h3>



<p>The environment is the <em>encompassing system</em> in which the agents exist. Environment can be characterised by the types of interactions that are allowed. Below are two examples of environments distinguished by agent-agent interactions.</p>



<ul><li>Spatial environments allow agents to directly interact with each other. This environment can be as simple as a 2D grid, or more complicated to model real world environments. Agents occupy a position and can interact with nearby agents (‘nearby’ as defined in the model) or even with the environment itself.</li><li>Abstract environments are generally used when agents do not directly interact with other agents, rather they interact with the environment. This is useful when modelling Economic Markets: Corporations (agents) make decisions (actions) based on the market (environment) which in turn affects the market and other corporations.</li></ul>



<p>In my zombie outbreak example, the environment would be spatial. Agent-agent interaction would only be possible for agents in neighbouring positions. The model could allow for agent-environment interactions, for example: obstacles could provide cover for humans, or areas could decrease the speed of agents. I could even add an abstract environment like ‘Global Panic’, which would change human agent behaviours and increase as the zombie population grows.</p>



<h3>Simulation</h3>



<p>This is the part of the agent-based model which controls how the situation (agent, actions, and environment described above) can be run programmatically.</p>



<p>The simulation controls the start up of the model, the execution of each iteration period, and the number of iterations over which the model is run. The iteration period is a set period of time relevant to the model, it can be a specifically chosen time step or arbitrary.</p>



<p>It is during each iteration that rules are applied to the agents to determine their behaviour and the actions they may take. In most agent-based models, each agent is considered one by one. The simulation controls whether the effect of actions is applied while going through the agents or at the completion of the iteration.</p>



<p>The simulation runs multiple iterations to see how the system evolves. Then the simulation is repeated to determine the likelihood of given outcomes.</p>



<p>It is very difficult to describe how the simulation could work for a specific example without going into deep details of the situation. With the zombie outbreak, the simulation would need to dictate how agents are placed at the start, the order agents are allowed to act (one by one or all at once), when to consider interactions (agent-agent or agent-environment), and more.</p>



<p>I hope that this description of agent-based modelling as four components has been informative and whets your appetite. If you are interested in reading a more in-depth description of the components and seeing how created my own Zombie Outbreak agent-based model, then please continue reading. </p>

<h2>Zombie Model</h2>



<p>So, in my ‘real-world’ situation I have a group of humans and one zombie. To make it interesting (and give the zombie a chance) the agents will all be restricted to an enclosed area. Zombies want to bite humans and will try to catch them. Humans will try to get away from zombies. I assume that any human caught by a zombie is bitten and becomes a zombie. Humans do not get hungry or tired, and they cannot fight the zombies. The aim of this model is to determine how long a human agent can survive and see if there are any factors which improve their chances.</p>



<p>I will create my model by breaking it down into the four components.</p>



<h3>Agents</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?resize=178%2C178&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="178" height="178" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?w=583&amp;ssl=1 583w, https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?w=583&amp;ssl=1 583w, https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/4cda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agent-based-modelling-Agents3-3.png?resize=178%2C178&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>My model consists of individuals with one defining characteristic: Zombie or Human. To accomplish my aim (see how long humans survive), I will also include an age attribute for human agents. This will count the number of iterations a human has survived for. </p>



<p>Humans behave normally and try to stay human by avoiding zombies. The nature of zombies makes it difficult to describe ‘behaviour’, simply put zombies want to eat human brains.</p>



<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>Human agents will move to increase the distance between them and the closest zombie, while zombie agents will move closer to decrease this distance. If there are equally close zombies/humans, then one will be picked at random and treated as the closest (improvements can be made so that humans make ‘smarter’ decisions when avoiding multiple zombies). &nbsp;If there is a zombie-human interaction (a zombie catches a human) then the human becomes a zombie. In my model the humans have no behaviours allowing for resistance, so all interactions have this result.</p>

<p>The agents will exist in a spatial environment. I’ll create it as a 10×10 grid where each cell can only have one occupant. Each agent has full visibility of all other agents and can only move to adjacent tiles (including diagonals) as part of their movement action. Interaction occurs between zombies and agents …</p></div></article></div></section></div>

<div>
<p>Every now and then, <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/658650/iphone-11-pro-max-production-cost-bill-materials-bom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">articles</a> <a href="https://technology.informa.com/582313/ihs-markit-teardown-analysis-microsofts-xbox-one-s-brings-significant-value-gains-with-minimal-commercial-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-rift-components-cost-around-200-new-teardown-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> stating how much higher the prices of products are than the cost of the parts that go into them. Most of these are based on woefully incorrect estimates, but they also ignore the full cost of bringing a product into market. As a consumer, it’s illuminating to dig in further. If you’re the one building and selling products though, understanding the full cost of designing, manufacturing, selling, and supporting them is a matter of life and death for your company. The generic guidance is that a product should be sold for around 3x the cost of the materials, but in actual products that could range anywhere from 0.5x (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the razor and blades model</a>) to 10x (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veblen goods</a>) depending on company strategy and cost structure and the market the product is in.</p>
<p>Regardless of the pricing strategy, the best way to understand costs is to build out a detailed model and start running through different cost, price, and volume scenarios early in the development process. There are some great guides on this from <a href="https://medium.com/@BenEinstein/will-your-hardware-startup-make-money-677a8e6c665b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Einstein</a> and <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=2812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Huang</a>. My general recommendation is to read as much material as you can and then distill it down into the specifics that are relevant to your product and business. In addition to providing one more reference point, I wanted to release a practical cost model in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oVfFDxAkNXaVoPj-XpzeINiFcqkmc4ay/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Sheets and Excel</a> that you can start from.</p>
<p>Our cost calculator is broken down into manufacturing costs, financing costs, fulfillment costs, support costs, fixed costs, internal costs, and program inputs.&nbsp; This may sound like a lot of data, but each of these is only a high level placeholder to use for early modeling.&nbsp; By the time you’re ready to start selling a product, you should have a portfolio of highly customized and detailed spreadsheets with a range of scenarios modeled.&nbsp; For now, let’s step through the sections in the basic model one by one.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Costs</h3>

<p>We’ll start with manufacturing costs, which are the most intuitive part of the cost of a product.&nbsp; This is the cost of the materials and labor required to make the product.&nbsp; You’ll need a detailed costed Bill of Materials (BOM) to feed into the calculator.&nbsp; You can reference <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bunnie’s guide</a> or a model that <a href="https://blog.dragoninnovation.com/blog/2015/11/10/introducing-the-dragon-standard-bom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Innovation</a> has made available.&nbsp; The BOM is made up of components, modules, royalties, consumables, packaging, and other materials, while the MVA refers to the Manufacturing Value Add of labor and manufacturer profit on the product.&nbsp; We also extend the model by considering yield and reworks.&nbsp; It would be extremely rare for a consumer electronics production line to output 100% perfect units.&nbsp; Typically a few percent (ideally decreasing over time) would have functional or cosmetic issues caught in testing and inspection, and would need to be “reworked” or repaired before they can be packed and shipped out.&nbsp; The output of this section is the amount of money paid per unit to the manufacturing partner at the Freight on Board (FOB) location, where you take ownership of the product inventory.</p>
<h3>Financing Costs</h3>

<p>Cost models often skip over financing, but this is an important part for a startup.&nbsp; It may be difficult to cover the cost of inventory entirely with cash on hand, so you may need an Inventory Line of Credit or similar type of loan to cover the time between payment being due to the supplier and receiving payment from a customer.&nbsp; This is a very basic financing model that uses simple interest and doesn’t account for differing payment terms to different suppliers, but it is a starting point you can extend on.</p>
<h3>Fulfillment Costs</h3>

<p>Now we start to get into the more obscure details of product cost, which are the costs of getting a unit from the FOB location to your customer’s doorstep.&nbsp; Note that this model only covers direct sale to the consumer and not retail sales.</p>
<p>First we’ll determine the logistics costs.&nbsp; This depends on the size and quantity of what you’re selling, but for consumer electronics, you would typically pack units together into a bigger box called a master carton and then stack together master cartons to fill a pallet.&nbsp; If you’re selling more or larger products, you may be handling container loads or if you’re selling fewer or smaller, you may do logistics at the master carton level, but we’ll stick with pallets for this model.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.onpallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onpallet</a> has a convenient calculator to estimate how many units can make up a pallet load.&nbsp; We then use <a href="https://www.freightos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frieghtos</a> to estimate the cost of getting a pallet from the FOB port to a port in the sales region by both air and sea, along with the truck or rail cost to go from the port to your fulfillment warehouse.&nbsp; Air is of course significantly more expensive and carbon intensive, but can cut 20-30 days off of the time to cross the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; Carbon offsets from a non-profit like <a href="https://carbonfund.org/take-action/businesses/business-calculators/#gf_27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbonfund</a> can help you mitigate the harm, but you should consider the air/sea split over time carefully.&nbsp; Companies often use air freight to accelerate a launch and then switch to sea as they are able to build up an inventory buffer.</p>
<p>The fulfillment partner, typically referred to as a Third Party Logistics (3PL) partner, will have additional costs you need to model around sorting and storing incoming goods as well as picking, scanning, and packing up the product to ship to the consumer.&nbsp; If you warehouse internally instead of using a 3PL, you’ll instead capture your staffing costs here.&nbsp; You will also need to capture the cost of shipping to consumers and the payment processing fees to be able to take payment from them.&nbsp; All of these will change from region to region, so your eventual model should include multiple fulfillment cost structures and a region split model.</p>
<h3>Support Costs</h3>

<p>Next, we need to consider the overall cost of supporting a product in the field.&nbsp; This includes remorse returns from consumers, warranty failures, and the staffing costs of your support team.&nbsp; Something to keep in mind is that returns and warranty failures shouldn’t be written off, but should be refurbished and brought back into the market.&nbsp; We include the average costs of refurbishing and the percent of original price for the refurbished unit in the model.</p>
<h3>Fixed Costs</h3>

<p>In addition to the range of per-unit costs, we have to consider the fixed manufacturing costs for the product.&nbsp; That includes development payments to the manufacturing and component partners, the costs of tooling and line equipment, and certifications.&nbsp; It also includes excess and obsolescence (E&amp;O), which is the amount of material that goes unused when parts change or the product goes end of life.&nbsp; Note that many of these costs are not truly fixed, since tooling will wear out and your line costs may increase if you decide to increase manufacturing capacity.</p>
<h3>Internal Costs</h3>

<p>Finally, we have to consider the internal costs of developing and selling a product.&nbsp; Each of these rows can again come from a much more detailed model, but you can start with rough estimates.</p>
<h3>Program Inputs</h3>

<p>Against all of these, we have to state our inputs of sales price and volume.&nbsp; This is usually the most interesting place to start playing with different scenarios to determine what is needed to make a program break even and eventually profitable.&nbsp; Note that if you have multiple versions or SKUs of a product, you’ll want to build a more detailed calculator with SKU splits, BOM costs per SKU, and the added fixed costs per SKU.</p>
<h3>Program Outputs</h3>

<p>As you can see from our overall outputs, quite a lot more than the bare materials goes into the cost of a product.&nbsp; With a high level calculator in place, you can better understand what levers are most important to focus on for cost reduction.</p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>With a model in hand, you can start to do scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis.&nbsp; For scenario analysis, you can start by duplicating your data into new columns and adjusting some inputs to simulate different program scenarios.&nbsp; For example, you can create a range of columns that each have differing total sales volumes, which allows amortizing the fixed costs over more units and would generally also enable cost negotiation leverage in areas like the BOM and MVA.&nbsp; You can also sanity check trades between different buckets like BOM cost and internal development costs.&nbsp; As an example, you can check the volume at which it’s worth spending a few person-months of engineering time to save a dollar on a cheaper microcontroller.</p>
<p>It’s generally worthwhile to make some best-case and worst-case scenarios on volume and other inputs to see where you most need to focus for derisking a program.&nbsp; Sensitivity analysis is basically a method to formalize this and determine which inputs are most important for improving a target output, but it is outside the scope of this already very long blog post.</p>
<p>We hope this was a helpful starting point to understand product costs, and we’re happy to respond to any questions you have on it.&nbsp; We’ll plan to update the basic model as we get feedback over time to make it as useful as possible.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Milan prosecutors and the Italian Labour Inspectorate have jointly <a href="https://www.ispettorato.gov.it/it-it/notizie/Documents/Comunicato%20stampaTutele%20riders.pdf" target="_blank">ordered</a> four major food delivery platforms to fully hire over 60,000 couriers — and pay a total of €733 million in fines.</p>
<p>Couriers who worked for Uber Eats, Glovo, Just Eat and Deliveroo in Italy from 2017 to 2020 must now be treated as "coordinated and continuous workers," prosecutors declared.</p>
<p>If the companies pay the fines within 90 days, they will be able to avoid criminal proceedings — but legal experts say it's a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Should the platforms hire all 60,000 couriers, there's a high price to pay to catch up on previous, missed social security payments, said European labor law specialist Luca de Vecchi. Social security contributions in Italy can amount to up to 33 percent of an employee's salary and must be paid by the employer.</p>
<p>This poses a "very difficult decision" for the companies, de Vecchi added. Trying to appeal and fight the case in court risks criminal sanctions on the company managers, but accepting the fines could lead to the companies' demise. </p>
<p>"I don't know how they could manage to pay and remain alive," he said.</p>
<h3>Health and safety</h3>
<p>The sanctions are linked to alleged violations of health and safety regulations, following an investigation into driver accidents.</p>
<p>"It is no longer the time to say that riders are slaves, the time has come to say that they are citizens who need legal protection," said Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Greco in an online press conference, according to <a href="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" data-type="URL" data-id="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" target="_blank">Italian media</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a very heavy blow to the platform narrative, to their business model based on false autonomy and the abuse of occasional work, on the denial of any right and the infringement of laws and contracts," added the Deliverance Milano syndicate group in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deliverancemilano/posts/2734640120180349" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>. "There is no more time to waste: hiring and rights immediately, enough with precariousness and exploitation!"</p>

<p>The Assodelivery group — which represents the likes of Uber, Deliveroo, Glovo and JustEat — said they were "surprised" by the prosecutor's decision.</p>
<p>"The platforms, despite the specific differences, have operated in recent years in compliance with current regulations, including the classification of workers and workplace safety regulations," the group said in an emailed statement. "We therefore disagree with the picture illustrated today."</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Attention will now turn to the platforms, and "whether they will go back to negotiate with the minister of labour and the representative trade unions to try to solve the issue," said labor law expert Valerio de Stefano.</p>
<p>A negotiated settlement might be the most likely outcome, de Vecchi said. </p>
<p>"I think that at the end of the story there will be a compromise solution that will allow these companies to stay active — probably a limited fine without any criminal prosecution," said de Vecchi. "But on the other end, they will be forced to change their operational model and to have a different standard in terms of employees' rights and guarantees."</p>
<p>The ruling comes off the back of a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1618801">U.K. supreme court ruling</a> that declared Uber drivers to be "workers" rather than self-employed contractors, as well as a recent <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1612457">Dutch appeals court decision</a> that Deliveroo drivers are employees — signs of changing times in the gig economy. </p>

<p>"What's for sure is that it is basically more and more clear: we cannot pretend anymore that these people are just genuinely self-employed as if they were small undertakings — they are workers that should be protected as such," de Stefano said.</p>

Then I either find I like the code or I don't.</p></li><li><p>Maybe <a href="https://github.com/glato/emerge">emerge</a> could help to visualise, inspect and understand structure, dependencies, and some common metrics in your codebase, if the language is supported.</p></li><li><p>Set up meetings with people on the team to understand the architecture and what parts of the software are responsible for it. Then it’s usually best starting with a small task and over time taking bigger tasks. This way I gradually get an understanding of the codebase.</p></li><li><p>I'm a consultant, so I have to do this at least once every 6-12 months. Learn <em>systems</em>, not codebases:</p><ol><li>How does the app work from the user's point of view? Ask this first.</li><li>How is the application glued together? How does data flow in the context of the architecture?</li><li>How does code go from my computer into production? Understanding the details of the code is much easier in context.</li></ol></li></ul><ul><li>When I started my 1.5 year tour at Google a long while ago, it was the first place I'd ever worked where knowing the whole codebase was clearly impossible. Accepting that was liberating. Since then I haven't concerned myself with knowing a whole codebase and I'm better for it.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Use it. Like a user. Applies to APIs and libraries too. They all have a user interface.</p></li><li><p>Browse through the live version to get an idea of what the application does. Sort of see it from the eyes of the users.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Set up the codebase locally and get it to run.</p></li><li><p>I try to make sure my environment, builds, and things like that work. I can't count the number of hours I wasted trying to do something, before realising I was missing some key part of the process. Simply going from cloning a repository to building and running the latest version locally gives you loads of good information.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Do not be afraid to ask questions.</p></li><li><p>Ask people if you can't find the answer quickly. It's better to ask than to waste time.</p></li><li><p>I ask someone who is familiar with the codebase to give me a big picture overview.</p></li><li><p>Keep asking questions to the person who wrote the code, with increasing urgency as they get closer and closer to leaving.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Pair programming is great for getting started with a codebase. We use this technique a lot at <a href="https://twitter.com/qumulo">@qumulo</a> and it is a fast way to pick up a lot of details.</p></li><li><p>Grab hold of the nearest experienced developer and make them pair program with you until they're sick of you! Seriously though, pair or mob programming is probably the best way to introduce anyone to a new codebase or team, regardless of skill levels or complexity!</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Try to find internal documentation for certain domain knowledge. Unfortunately, good onboarding documentation for new joiners or new contributers to a codebase is often not readily available.</p></li><li><p>Read the documentation, perhaps find a textbook explaining how to understand a codebase based on its tech stack, and try searching for answers on Stack Overflow.</p></li><li><p>Writing the often missing documentation is a great way to learn and a good excuse to talk people and ask questions.</p></li><li><p>Good documentation and a code editor with the ability to jump to method definitions is essential I think. That's the number one thing that helps, for me at least.</p></li><li><p>Read the docs if available.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Take notes on everything, in whatever form works for you. You WILL forget things. That's okay and expected.</p></li><li><p>Ask questions and takes notes as much as possible.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Go <dfn>spelunking</dfn> (a term used to describe exploring a cave) in order to find bugs. Reading code or documentation in isolation does not help me to <dfn>grok</dfn> (understand) a codebase, but contributing to the codebase does.</p></li><li><p>Look at a REST endpoint then follow it to the actual data or action. Add breakpoints to debug the code bit by bit. You can add breakpoints to code within your chosen code editor or inside a browser's developer tools.</p></li><li><p>Add a small cosmetic change somewhere - extra logging, some debug output in the user interface for example. In trying to make those kinds of changes you often learn a lot.</p></li><li><p>Find a simple bug to fix: reproduce it, look in the code to find the call stack that leads to it. Timebox this! Don't worry if you get lost. If you are lost, ask someone who has knowledge of the codebase.</p></li><li><p>Run the debugger with some breakpoints. Observe what's going on.</p></li><li><p>I've been fascinated by how people use incidents as pulling back curtains on specific facets of how things are supposed to work.</p></li><li><p>Most of the tickets for new hires should be bugs. Maybe the occasional copy change – something small like changing the default order of a list to be 'creation time' rather than 'alphabetical'.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>This may sound aspirational, but get the project up and running and run tests.</p></li><li><p>I expect there to be well-documented tests and overall workflow.</p></li><li><p>Focus on parts of the system needed for a certain feature and discover things through tests and static analysis.</p></li><li><p>Look at the tests; hopefully they exist.</p></li><li><p>Start with test cases.</p></li><li><p>Hands down my preferred approach is to start writing tests for a codebase, or if it already has unit tests, find what area is under tested.</p></li><li><p>Writing user interface tests, for example using Cypress and API mocking.</p></li><li><p>Changing or adding some tests can help you understand how things work.</p></li><li><p>In practice, almost everybody has to work on codebases they don't fully <dfn>grok</dfn> (understand). I forget parts I haven't touched in a while, so that's why it pays off to invest in practices enabling people to understand a codebase quickly. These practices involve good tests, good continuous integration/delivery, and ultimately good observability in production too.</p></li></ul><ul><li>If I’m trying to work out what to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> for, looking at logs or error messages is often helpful. For example, passing random input to a service will spit out a stack trace and an error message as it fails to parse whatever you sent, and that can be pretty revealing.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Dig in to wherever there are actual changes to be made, and give yourself time to learn from there.</p></li><li><p>Splitting up a code base into smaller, self-contained pieces works especially well for Open Source. It makes one-time contributions easier by minimising the required mental overhead.</p></li><li><p>I focus on understanding the bits I need to work on. Whether it is a bug or feature I’ve been assigned to, and I skip the rest. 95% of the time, a good choice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> will help me find the files I want, and I work things out from there.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>From experience, it takes time to learn the different components of a codebase, especially ones that are large and complex. Learning comes from working on different features or components, reading documentation, and asking lots of questions.</p></li><li><p>I recently started a new job at a company with a HUGE and very complicated codebase, for an enterprise software suite. Here's what has helped me:</p><ol><li>Find a mentor who is familiar with the code, able to explain clearly, and whose communication style matches yours.</li><li>Get a 10,000 foot overview of the codebase from your mentor: what products the projects or solutions correspond to, any external dependencies on 3rd party libs or apps, a high-level dependency tree, what projects are most relevant to you at this time. Your mentor can hopefully point you in the right direction.</li><li>If you don't know where to start or what you're going to be working on, ask! When you start a new job or project, this is the time to ask questions. Ask who the best person is to talk to about each framework.</li><li>Ask about the development process for the area, project, or team you're working on. What's the workflow for issues? Who will code review your stuff? Who will test it? What things need to be checked off to call the issue done. Does this involve development testing notes, pull requests or merges, documentation, etc?</li></ol></li><li><p>As usual, I feel like my answer leaves people pretty unsatisfied. You won't get a handle on a codebase quickly. You can start to understand certain parts and let the rest unfold over time.</p><p>Whenever I talk to people about where questions like this come from, it often one of two things. "I feel like I want to learn this …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>In the Unabomber Manifesto, Section 212 always remained unfulfilling to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological form? Maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That issue is why the “Freedom Club” revolution isn’t appealing. Genies do not go back in boxes. Similar to the communist manifesto, while problems are correctly identified, the solution leaves something to be desired.</p>

<hr>


<p>Ran Prieur takes technology and <a href="https://www.ranprieur.com/tech.html">breaks it down</a> in a more nuanced way than I think about it. I’m going to focus on a single axis.</p>

<p>Compare Waymo to comma. In one, you need cooperation from a society, in the other you don’t. One is a complex system that depends on industry and loses it’s usefulness out of context. The other is a complex self contained system.</p>

<p>A woman in a forest can create a supercomputer. This computer is off the grid, will last for 40+ years, has petaflops of compute power, and is self repairing. It exists in harmony with nature. It is non-toxic.</p>

<p>The smartphone is a marvel. The network, a nightmare. As well as the society needed to produce it.</p>

<hr>


<p>If all our world died tomorrow, from COVID-22 or something, we would leave behind godshatter. Relics with untold power. Imagine finding all that’s left is a smartphone. Useless without a solar charger, but add one and it’s a most valuable relic. And if they downloaded wikipedia offline, the discovery of that phone will allow you to rebuild it. Can we bootstrap faster?</p>

<p>That’s godshatter of the information age. A handheld device that allowed you to breathe underwater. A phaser. A portable device that could construct houses. The doctor’s mobile emitter. A machine that pulls the water from the air. A handheld flying machine. An arc reactor. All ruined if you have to connect to WiFi.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Profits">Perhaps a replicator could make you god.</a></p>

<hr>


<p>Why does anyone want Waymo? We need to decentralize the world, not build brittle systems that leak power. A Waymo network can be used for evil if evil people are at the controls. The Bitcoin blockchain has no controls. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. We’d live in a better world if nuclear weapons weren’t possible, owned by tens.</p>

<p>Can we build technology without industry? I fantasize about living in a forest with my AI girlfriend while we probe the universe. <b>What pathetic losers are building Twitter and Facebook.</b> That’s practically industry without technology. And they have the nerve to call themselves technology companies.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. Am I building technology to further centralize or decentralize power?</p>

<p>Power is beautiful. Using energy to create order is the highest calling of God. Energy use isn’t bad! Uniform rectangular buildings are bad. Industrial chemical factories are bad. Humans are good.</p>

<hr>


<p>I’ve been learning biology. It’s unreal how amazing the technology to build humans is. Only now are we close with our stack. Human DNA is 6 GB. That’s a DVD. In 1970, you couldn’t store 6GB. Today, I can copy it in seconds on my M1 SSD. That’s actually faster than nature.</p>

<p>Biology is non-toxic. Biology is efficient. Biology is beautiful. Biology is technology.</p>

<p>Biology is not centralized. Biology is not alien. Biology is not rectangular. Biology is not industrial.</p>

<hr>


<p>STOP BUILDING SHITTY TECHNOLOGY.</p>

<p>If it centralizes power, it’s bad. If it decentralizes power, it’s good. Build technology that is inextricable from its narrative. Build technology that will give us freedom, not enslavement.</p>

<p>One axis to consider. Does this centralize or decentralize power? The power itself is unstoppable. How we divide it is a choice.</p>

<hr>


<p>I wish I had a more concrete plan. But for the love of God, if you build technology, consider this axis. Build the wrong technology, and we will live in an eternal prison.</p>

Throughout my entire life, I have always taken great interest in science (hang with me here) and have pursued many fun engineering projects on my own time - outside of school. One of these projects I decided to turn into a startup, called Puriphico, after receiving a lot of interest from my community, school, friends, etc. about the idea. I hope to use Medium as a means of sharing my experiences throughout this journey: what I have learned and how I hope to give back by teaching others. In this article, I’ll take you through my story, explaining my biggest areas of growth that I think deter many people from commencing their own entrepreneurial (or even engineering) journey. If you have questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below, and I will answer them!</span></p><div id="viewer-ev0qd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.puriphico.com/post/at-age-15-i-founded-a-tech-startup-here-s-what-i-learned" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_a94134b591004938a78571b869a316dc~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.jpg" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_a94134b591004938a78571b869a316dc~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-200ml"><span><u>My story:</u></span></p><p id="viewer-cuh04"><span>	Towards the end of my 8th grade school year, there was an event called project week - a week in which all the students worked solely on a project outside of school. Being the unnecessary overachiever that I am, I decided I wanted to push myself that week, and I sought to build something that could carry a positive impact in my community while testing the limits of my creativity and ingenuity. When standing in the restroom line at a local coffee shop one day, I witnessed the absurdly little time people spent washing their hands after using the restroom. Watching them grip an egg sandwich before shoving it in their mouth after hardly washing their hands made me nauseous: not only was it gross, it was unsafe, to say the very least. I won’t say the idea hit me at once, but over the next few days, I found myself hung up on the issue, envisioning various prototypes of my new device. What device was I envisioning, exactly? Good question: the device, implemented in a sink faucet, would help someone properly wash their hands by, first, detecting the user’s presence using visual and auditory sensors and, second, clocking their handwashing with visual LED cues. After the user has washed their hands for 20 seconds (the sufficient amount of time recommended by the CDC to remove all harmful pathogens from the hands), the device would flash a green light three times, indicating that you are good to go! When I first explained the concept to some of my advisors, they were skeptical about the concept, but they approved my project. The following week, I gave my presentation to the school board, parents, students, and many other people. (read about the device <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>.)</span></p><div id="viewer-71lsk"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.puriphico.com/post/at-age-15-i-founded-a-tech-startup-here-s-what-i-learned" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_89f5dded9f7e419cbd204dd6ad782d4d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.jpg" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_89f5dded9f7e419cbd204dd6ad782d4d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-datk7"><span>	I was proud of my apparent success in completing the device so quickly, but I didn’t stop there; over the last three years, I have still been iterating the prototype, making entirely new versions, and improving on previous generations. The process has taught me many things: how to use embedded systems, how to program, how circuits work, how to make custom PCB’s with my own circuit designs, how to 3D model/print, how to build a website, and much more. If you want to learn more about my device, visit this article. </span></p><p id="viewer-ehm2e"><span>But wait: I just glossed over possibly the most difficult part of my journey - that first week, where I tasked myself with learning to program and use circuits, implement my new knowledge, and design a presentation all in one week. Like they say, the hardest part is always the start, which, understandably, is why most people never start. Luckily for me, I had committed myself to the project and could not afford to quit, so that first week, I put my head down and read, learning everything I possibly could about everything I might need to know. Since then, I have improved upon my skills, and I feel ready to share my product with the world, as well as the skills necessary to build it. </span></p><p id="viewer-cmpnt"><span><u>What do I mean when I say this?</u></span></p><p id="viewer-42itj"><span>	I have experienced firsthand many of the challenges that people try to avoid when doing something new: most people are afraid of trying something new because they are afraid of making mistakes and breaking their comfort zone. While I can’t directly help with the fear and motivate you, I can help in providing the groundwork for building your own electronic products (or products in general). This education will make your goals much more attainable and, as a result, less scary! If a 13-year-old could do it, you certainly can, and I hope to help you along your own personal journey.  </span></p><p id="viewer-36nlp"><span><u>How will I do this?</u></span></p><p id="viewer-cs1g8"><span>	I found the best way to learn is by doing. Before learning to build my device, I went and found other projects to copy so that I could practice implementing what I had read in my books; then, when I felt ready, I leaped into my own project: the assimilation of all the knowledge I had accumulated from my prior experiences. Therefore, I hope to teach you the basics of electronic products through the lens of my handwashing device. I will teach you how to build every prototype, ranging in difficulty from easiest to hardest. Throughout the process, you will learn and understand circuits, programming, PCBs, 3D modeling/printing, and much more so that when you are ready to build your own product, you can do so as if it were second nature. </span></p><p id="viewer-7ebgm"><span>	No, there is no course you have to pay for or anything like that - all the tutorials will be posted on my website (the <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/build-your-own" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Build-Your-Own</u></a> page) and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC25QUdv5BI4KMx598UR0IWA/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>YouTube</u></a> channel - I will even write blog posts summarizing the content of each tutorial, which will be published on my website as well as <a href="https://adrianlazzi.medium.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Medium</u></a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=AdrianLazzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Hacker News</u></a>. If you are interested in building your own exciting projects, subscribe to my <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>website</u></a> and YouTube channel and follow me on Medium and Instagram, where I will be posting weekly tutorials and updates.

    <h2>Bitcoin is screwed</h2>

<p>I just realized that Bitcoin is screwed.</p>

<p>I just came across a digital currency system called Taler that solves the double spending problem by having a central authority, and makes certain provisions for levying taxes, but is also reasonably anonymous, like cash.</p>

<p>This is the best system for money I've ever seen. It's like Visa/Mastercard, but open source and with buyer anonymity. No one knows what you spend your stuff on. But everyone knows what you earned your stuff with. So it can be used within existing governments.</p>

<p>And here's the thing. The reason Bitcoin has perverse incentives for energy use, and for that reason is inherently expensive, slow and inflexible, is that it wants to do without a central authority.</p>

<p>But it's a mirage. Bitcoin can't do without a central authority. There are no power stations without a central authority. Someone has to own them, and operate them. None of that works without a central authority. It does in the little colored books of the Libertarian ideologues, who are surprised time and time again when getting rid of the government actually does not magically solve all problems. But put it to the test- nope, can't run a power station without a working legal system. Can't produce chips and have a computer supply chain without a working legal system. Everything you need to produce Bitcoins depends on the existence of technologically advanced, government-regulated civilization.</p>

<p>And if you have that- why bother doing without a central authority? Just use the darn government to solve the double spending problem. You're already doing that with Bitcoin, just in a convoluted, perversely inefficient, comically inept Rube Goldberg machine kind of way.</p>

<p>In other words- Bitcoin broke its own promise before it ever left the laboritory. It was never designed to be decentralized. It came as close as is humanely possible by all means, but quite simply by needing electricity and advanced silicon, it's doomed. In other words, Bitcoin never was what claimed to be. It's main virtue is that it's pretty good at obfuscating that.</p>

<p>For this reason, I believe that Bitcoin is going to experience a series of booms and busts, but it will never play a significant role in organizing society, building schools and bridges, banking the unbanked, and lifting people out of powverty. But Taler might.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>QEMU 3.0.0 can boot IBM’s AIX to a shell prompt. AIX is IBM’s version of Unix for their Power Systems line of PowerPC servers. I’ve been <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">researching emulation</a>, so I wrote a tutorial for running AIX on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

<p>Trying out AIX takes about 20 minutes. I tested these instructions on macOS 10.13.6.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the <a href="https://www-304.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/diags/download/home.html">AIX 7.2 Standalone Diagnostics disk</a> from IBM. You want <code>CD72220.ISO</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: (optional) If you want the Diagnostics disk to give you an AIX shell prompt instead of running diagnostics, apply <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/aixqemu/patch_cd72220.py">this patch</a> to your ISO file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python patch_cd72220.py CD72220.ISO ModdedCD.ISO
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(this replaces <code>usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl</code> on the ISO with a shell script that launches <code>/bin/sh</code>)</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Download and install QEMU 3.0.0.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch QEMU with this command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio \
	-cdrom ModdedCD.iso \
	-d guest_errors \
	-prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "boot-command=dev / 0 0 s\" ibm,aix-diagnostics\" property boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Wait. (It’ll get stuck on <code>define_rspc</code> for a long time.)</p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: After <strong>nine</strong> very, very long minutes, you’ll be greeted with this notice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
 ******* Please define the System Console. *******

Type a 1 and press Enter to use this terminal as the
  system console.
Pour definir ce terminal comme console systeme, appuyez
  sur 1 puis sur Entree.
Taste 1 und anschliessend die Eingabetaste druecken, um
  diese Datenstation als Systemkonsole zu verwenden.
Premere il tasto 1 ed Invio per usare questo terminal
  come console.
Escriba 1 y pulse Intro para utilizar esta terminal como
  consola del sistema.
Escriviu 1 1 i premeu Intro per utilitzar aquest
  terminal com a consola del sistema.
Digite um 1 e pressione Enter para utilizar este terminal
  como console do sistema.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Type 1 in your terminal, then press enter.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: After another two minutes, you’ll be dropped to an AIX shell prompt (or, if you didn’t patch the ISO, the IBM Diagnostics tool):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>exec(/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl,/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl){983324,917792}
exec(/bin/sh){1638718,983324}
#
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, you can try some Unix commands. The Diagnostics CD doesn’t have many tools, but you can try <code>uname -a</code>, <code>mount</code>, or <code>lscfg</code>.</p>

<p>(If you’re using the Diagnostics tool, you’ll be stuck on the step where it asks you to choose a terminal. Anyone knows how to get past this step?)</p>

<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: once you’re done, close the QEMU window.</p>

<p>Alternatively, press Ctrl-A, then C to drop into the QEMU monitor, then type <code>q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>The full boot log <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/aixqemu/aixboot.txt">can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="edit-sep-7-2018">Edit (Sep 7, 2018)</h2>

<p>Since writing this article, I’ve also found <a href="https://twitter.com/bluestonechina/status/1001269160872046592">Liang Guo’s tutorial</a> on setting up AIX, so if you have an AIX setup disc instead of the Live CD, you can install a proper AIX virtual machine.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.nutanix.com/ibm/">Nutanix</a>’s AIX VMs <a href="https://twitter.com/robmcnelly/status/991698624357847040">are hosted with QEMU</a>. That’s cool! I didn’t know there’s a production deployment of AIX on QEMU.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a Unix system! I know this!</p>

  <p>– Jurassic Park (1993)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX">IBM AIX</a> is a proprietary Unix variant developed by IBM for their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/power">Power Systems</a> line of POWER9 servers. In the 1990s, every workstation or server manufacturer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">had</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tru64_UNIX">their</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIX">own</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX">version</a> of Unix. IBM’s AIX is one of the few still being updated today.</p>

<p>Importantly for me, QEMU 3.0.0 can emulate AIX without any modifications or workarounds, allowing me to try an Enterprise operating system without access to expensive hardware.</p>

<p>In fact, AIX even detects if it’s being run in QEMU:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ strings - bootfile.exe |grep qemu
patch_qemu
qemu,pseries
qemu,pseries
                        ---&gt; qemu,pseries detected &lt;---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>suggesting that IBM themselves have experimented with QEMU and AIX.</p>

<p>From the few minutes I spent playing with AIX, I find it fascinating that AIX is close enough to macOS (BSD) and Linux (GNU), yet subtlely different. In some places, the old Unix preference for terseness is visible:</p>

<p>AIX:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># halt --help
halt: illegal option -- -
usage: halt [-y][-q][-l][-n][-p]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>vs Linux:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ halt --help
halt [OPTIONS...]
Halt the system.
     --help      Show this help
     --halt      Halt the machine
  -p --poweroff  Switch off the machine
     --reboot    Reboot the machine
  -f --force     Force immediate halt/power-off/reboot
  -w --wtmp-only Don't halt/power-off/reboot, just write wtmp record
  -d --no-wtmp   Don't write wtmp record
     --no-wall   Don't send wall message before halt/power-off/reboot
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>yet other parts gained richer interfaces as befit an Enterprise operating system:</p>

<p>AIX:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># mount
  node       mounted        mounted over    vfs       date        options      
-------- ---------------  ---------------  ------ ------------ --------------- 
         /dev/ram0        /                jfs    Jan 01 00:00 rw              
         /dev/ramdisk0    /mnt             jfs    Sep 06 03:12 rw,nointegrity  
         /mnt             /tmp             namefs Sep 06 03:12 rw    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>macOS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mount
/dev/disk1s1 on / (apfs, local, journaled)
devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)
/dev/disk1s4 on /private/var/vm (apfs, local, noexec, journaled, noatime, nobrowse)
map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)
map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It keeps me just off balance enough to be interesting.</p>

<h2 id="lets-just-try-it">Let’s just try it</h2>

<p>I chose to try AIX in QEMU mostly because, unlike IBM’s other Enterprise operating systems (IBM i and z/OS), IBM provides a free Diagnostics disc for Power Systems - which contains a live version of AIX.</p>

<p>Others have tried running AIX without a physical IBM Power Server. <a href="https://tyom.blogspot.com/">One person</a> got AIX 4.2 and 5.1 to boot on QEMU. However, modern AIX (7.1) seemed  impossible to run in QEMU, according to mailing list posts from 2012, like <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-02/msg00048.html">this thread</a>, <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-06/msg00120.html">this thread</a>, or <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-09/msg00160.html">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that was six years ago, right? Let’s see what happens if I boot the disc today.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio -cdrom CD72220.iso
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>Trying to load:  from: disk ... 
E3405: No such device
Trying to load:  from: /vdevice/v-scsi@71000003/disk@8200000000000000 ...   Successfully loaded

AIX 
    Star
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it’s stuck there. Did the boot process hang? Or is it just slow?</p>

<p>OK, I need to get more debugging output. To do so, I need to set boot parameters.</p>

<h2 id="setting-open-firmware-variables">Setting Open Firmware variables</h2>

<p><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-02/msg00048.html">According to the QEMU mailing list</a>, I need to use this command to boot AIX with verbose messages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://people.redhat.com/~thuth/blog/slof/2017/01/16/prom-env.html">This guide</a> showed how to change the default boot command, by passing environment variables to SLOF, QEMU’s bootloader:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-prom-env "boot-command=boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same article also mentions other SLOF environment variables; two important ones are <code>input-device</code> and <code>output-device</code>, which sets the default input and output devices of the firmware. By default, this is the emulated graphical screen and keyboard. Following the commit message on <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/818725/">this patch</a>, I switched it to the virtual serial port to make interacting with the system easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
-prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added the QEMU logging option <code>-d unimp,guest_errors</code> to show me when AIX invokes some unimplemented behaviour in QEMU.</p>

<p>The new command line is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio \
  -cdrom CD72220.iso \
  -d unimp,guest_errors \
  -prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
  -prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
  -prom-env "boot-command=boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="why-did-it-eject-the-cd">Why did it eject the CD?</h2>

<p>Verbose boot and the <code>-d unimp</code> option definitely helped: with Verbose boot, I can see that <code>/sbin/init</code> starts executing, indicating that the kernel actually booted fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>StarLED{814}

AIX Version 7.2
exec(/etc/init){1,0}

INIT: EXECUTING /sbin/rc.boot 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition, this message popped up once every second - which reassures me that AIX hasn’t frozen yet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Unimplemented SPAPR hcall 0x00000000000002b8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I waited out the several minute boot process, only to be greeted with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>exec(/usr/sbin/bootinfo,-M){983360,917792}
exec(/usr/lib/boot/bin/bootinfo_chrp,-M){983360,917792}
exec(/etc/eject,/dev/cd0){983362,917792}
exec(/usr/lib/methods/showled,0xA71){983364,917792} 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why did it eject the CD? A search for LED code “0xA71” gave no answers. The <code>-M</code> option for bootinfo is undocumented, so I don’t know what value would continue the boot process.</p>

<p>I needed to examine the CD’s boot script to find which value <code>bootinfo_chrp -M</code> needs to return.</p>

<p>To get the init script, I first tried extracting the ram filesystem from the bootfile.exe. Unfortunately, the first bytes of the extracted filesystem were “<code>01 02 03 04</code>”, which didn’t match any file systems I could find. In addition, there are no visible strings in the filesystem, suggesting that it’s compressed.</p>

<p>I resorted to plan B: dumping the entire RAM of the virtual machine to a giant 2GB file using QEMU’s Monitor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(qemu) pmemsave 0 0x80000000 look2g.bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and running <code>strings</code> on this document gave me:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>##########################################################################
# Check to see if the system has diagnostics support 
# if not eject cd
bootinfo -M &gt;/dev/null
if [ "$?" -ne 101 -a "$?" -ne 103 ] ; then
eject_cd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So <code>bootinfo_chrp -M</code> must return 101 or 103.</p>

<h2 id="the-device-tree">The device tree</h2>

<p>Thankfully, the CD includes a copy of <code>bootinfo_chrp</code> in <code>usr/lib/boot/bin</code>, and it included symbols; thus, it was simple to reverse engineer the logic.</p>

<p>The program checks for options with <code>getopt</code>, and handles <code>-M</code> using a method named <code>is_eserver</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>is_eserver</code> method can return 4 values, depending on the device tree’s root node:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the <code>ibm,model-class</code> property on the root node is “C5”, “D5”, or “E5”;
    <ul>
      <li>if the root node has the <code>ibm,aix-diagnostics</code> node, return 101.</li>
      <li>otherwise return 100.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise:
    <ul>
      <li>if the root node has the <code>ibm,aix-diagnostics</code> node, …</li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

The patient’s immune system is already sensitized to the foreign organ, and it’s harder to find a match.</p><p>Rothstein and his colleagues at the <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.stiresearch.health.pitt.edu/">Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute</a> at Pitt analyzed blood samples taken from 244 patients who received kidney transplants at <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.upmc.com/">UPMC</a> between 2013-2015, as well as another 95 kidney transplant patients who were treated at <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/the-royal-free-hospital/">Royal Free Hospital, London</a>, and found a highly predictive biomarker.</p><p>Of the patients who were identified as high-risk for rejection based on this new biomarker, 91% rejected the organ within the first year, compared to 10% in the low-risk group. And the high-risk group was significantly more likely to lose their transplanted kidneys five years after the surgery. The biomarker Rothstein and colleagues discovered is a proxy for functioning of regulatory B cells—a type of immune cell that tunes up or down the immune response—which have recently been implicated in organ rejection and proved challenging to measure. B cells can secrete both IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and, according to this new study, it’s the ratio of these two molecules that best measures regulatory B cell activity and predicts whether a patient is at high risk of rejection. </p><p>“Being a functional biomarker, ours gives us an idea of what goes wrong in these high-risk patients,” Rothstein said. “The balance between IL-10 and TNF seems to indicate your immune setpoint—is your immune system going to be quiescent or is it going to be revved up and try to reject the transplant? We hope we can restore that balance with anti-TNF drugs.”</p><p>Anti-TNF drugs haven’t been used much for transplant patients, but they’re a mainstay for treating rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions marked by inflammation, so the side effect profile is well-known. </p><p>To mitigate that risk, the idea is to treat patients with anti-TNF drugs for just a few months, which might be enough to “reset” the immune system to prevent rejection before it starts.</p><p>A human clinical trial is needed, but to show proof of principle, Rothstein and colleagues applied anti-TNF to B cells taken from high-risk patients and saw not only changes in the biomarker, but also a host of other changes indicative of restored regulatory B cell activity.

<p>Is your VirtualBox virtual machine starting to run out of disk space? No worries, because VirtualBox allows you to easily increase the disk size of your virtual machine. Just keep in mind that afterwards you still need to increase the size of your partitions accordingly. This article will help you along the way. It provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to increase the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine.<span data-ez-name="pragmaticlinux_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Virtual machines provide a great playground for learning about and testing out all sorts of Linux related things. Both for desktop and server purposes. But what do you do when your virtual machine runs out of disk space? On real hardware you would swap the hard disk for a larger version. But how do you achieve this task for your VirtualBox virtual machine?</p>
<p>Luckily, VirtualBox allows you to easily increase the size of your virtual disk. However, that’s not the end of the story. Your disk partitions still have the same size as before. So to complete the disk size increase of your VirtualBox virtual machine, you still need to change the size of the disk partition(s). This latter step is a bit trickier. Fear not, because this article provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to increase the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine.</p>
<p>If you don’t yet have a virtual machine, you can follow <a href="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/05/debian-10-buster-server-installation-in-virtualbox/">this tutorial</a> to create a minimal Debian server virtual machine in VirtualBox. This article takes the same Debian server virtual machine as a starting point.</p>
<h2>Virtual machine backup</h2>
<p>Increasing the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine, including the partition resizing, is an invasive operation. For this reason we’d better make a backup copy of the virtual machine. A virtual machine consists of plain files on you PC. Therefore simply copying these files already creates a backup of the entire virtual machine.</p>
<p>My Debian server virtual machine resides at this location in my user’s home directory:</p>
<p><code>/home/pragmalin/VirtualBox VMs/Debian Server/</code></p>
<p>The following two commands backup this virtual machine to a directory called <code>Debian Server Backup</code>:</p>
<p><code>cd ~/"VirtualBox VMs"</code></p>
<p><code>cp -avr "Debian Server" "Debian Server Backup"</code></p>
<p>These directory names contains spaces and therefore I surrounded them with double quotes.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="175" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/backup_virtual_machine.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the command for creating a backup of a VirtualBox virtual machine." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/backup_virtual_machine.png 630w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/backup_virtual_machine-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"></figure>
<p>If something goes wrong while performing the steps outlined in this article, you can simply delete the <code>Debian Server</code> directory and restore the backup. For restoring the backup, you can use a similar <code>cp</code> command as above. You just have to swap the <code>Debian Server</code> and <code>Debian Server Backup</code> command parameters around.<span data-ez-name="pragmaticlinux_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p>
<h2>Increase the size of your VDI virtual disk in VirtualBox</h2>
<p>Upon creation of a virtual machine, VirtualBox creates a VDI file. VDI stand for virtual disk image. Think of this VDI file as the hard disk of your virtual machine. To locate the name of your virtual machine’s VDI file, select your virtual machine on VirtualBox’s main screen. You can then see the name of the VDI file in the “Storage” section. In my case it is <code>Debian Server.vdi</code> and its current size equals 20 GB:</p>

It show you how to find the virtual disk image (VDI) name of the virtual machine." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find_vdi_name.png 886w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find_vdi_name-300x176.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find_vdi_name-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></figure>
<p>For increasing the size of your VDI disk, go to the VirtualBox main screen. Next, click on the icon located at the right side of the <em>Tools</em> entry. Select <em>Media</em> from the pop-up menu to open the media view. The media view lists all the hard disks attached to your virtual machines.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="521" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize.png" alt="Screenshot of VirtualBox which lists the media, including hard disks of all virtual machine. It explain how you can increase the VDI disk size of the virtual machine." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize.png 886w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize-300x176.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></figure>
<p>On the VirtualBox media view, select the VDI disk that you want to increase in size. In my case it is <code>Debian Server.vdi</code> which currently has a size of 20 GB. Once selected, you simply move the slider at the bottom of the screen to increase the disk size. In this example, I want to increase the disk size from 20 GB to 25 GB. Once you selected the new disk size, confirm it by clicking the <em>Apply</em> button. Keep in mind though that you can only increase the disk size and not decrease it.</p>
<p>Let’s verify that the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine actually got increased. Go ahead and start your virtual machine. Once ready, open the terminal if it has a desktop environment or log in via SSH if it is a server. List the information about the attached disks with command:</p>
<p><code>lsblk -p | grep "disk"</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="373" height="55" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_disk_size.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the output of the lsblk command to list the disks known to the virtual machine. It is used to verify that the disk size increase was successful." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_disk_size.png 373w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_disk_size-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px"></figure>
<p>As expected, the command output reports 25 GB for the disk size. This proves that we successfully increased the disk size of our VirtualBox virtual machine. All done, right? I’m afraid not. Run the following command to list the partitions:</p>
<p><code>lsblk -p | grep "part"</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="371" height="88" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_partition_size_too_small.png" alt="Terminal screenshot of the lsblk command which this time lists the size of the partitions. Here it becomes clear that the VirtualBox virtual machine disk size was increase, but that the partitions still have the same size as before, so not taking advantage of the disk size increase." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_partition_size_too_small.png 371w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_partition_size_too_small-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"></figure>
<p>After adding up the size of the individual partitions, we get to about 20 GB and not the desired 25 GB. So the virtual hard disk of our virtual machine was increased, but we still need to increase the partitions. The next section describes how to achieve this.</p>
<h2>Increase the size of your root file system partition</h2>
<p>The previous terminal screenshot tells us that the virtual machine has a primary partition <code>sda1</code> that holds the root file system. Furthermore, the virtual machine has an extended partition <code>sda2</code> that holds the swap partition <code>sda5</code>. For our virtual machine to reap the benefits of the larger disk size, we want to increase the partition with the root file system (<code>sda1</code>) from 18 GB to 23 GB. Unfortunately, you cannot change the partitions while the system is live. To solve this conundrum, we will boot our virtual machine from a GParted Live ISO.</p>
<h3>Download the GParted Live ISO</h3>
<p>The GParted Live ISO contains a CD image with a live Linux system, which includes the GParted program. With the GParted program you can change your disk partitioning and format disks. Note that making a mistake in GParted tends to be permanent. To the point where you might loose data on your virtual machine. That’s the reason why I recommended making a backup copy of the virtual machine first earlier in this article. If you decided to skip the step where you back up your virtual machine, now would be a good time to reconsider this decision.</p>
<p>Before we can boot our virtual machine from the GParted Live ISO, we should first download it. <a href="https://gparted.org/download.php">Visit the download section</a> of the GParted website. Once there, download the latest 64-bit stable release. At the time of this writing the latest stable release is 1.1.0-5:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="935" height="644" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted.png" alt="Web browser screenshot that shows you where to find the download link for the GParted Live ISO." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted.png 935w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted-300x207.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted-768x529.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px"></figure>
<p>After the download the file resides at the following location on my PC:</p>
<p><code>/home/pragmalin/Downloads/gparted-live-1.1.0-5-amd64.iso</code></p>
<h3>Attach the GParted Live ISO to the virtual machine</h3>
<p>With the GParted Live ISO downloaded, we connect it to the CD-ROM drive of our virtual machine. Make sure your virtual machine is powered off at this point. On the VirtualBox main screen, select your virtual machine and click the <em>Settings</em> button on the toolbar. When the <em>Settings</em> dialog appeared, go to the <em>Storage</em> section and select the <em>Empty</em> IDE controller. Once selected, click the blue disk icon button on the right side of the dialog. From the menu that dropped down, select the <em>Choose a disk file…</em> option. Now select the GParted Live ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Complete the configuration by clicking the <em>OK</em> button on the <em>Settings</em> dialog. The <em>Empty</em> IDE controller should now have changed to the name of the GParted Live ISO file:</p>

Specifically the section with the storage. It illustrates how to attach the GParted Live ISO to the virtual optical drive." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/attach_gparted_live_iso.png 891w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/attach_gparted_live_iso-300x229.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/attach_gparted_live_iso-768x586.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></figure>
<h3>Boot the virtual machine from the GParted Live ISO</h3>
<p>With the GParted Live ISO connected to the virtual machine’s optical drive, the virtual machine will boot from this Live CD image instead of its virtual disk. So go ahead and startup your virtual machine. A few prompts appear during the boot process. Just hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> every time to accept the defaults. Eventually, you’ll end with a basic desktop environment with the GParted program running:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="680" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot.png" alt="Screenshot of what the virtual machine looks like after it booted from the GParted Live ISO. It basically shows the automatically opened GParted program." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot.png 800w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot-300x255.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot-768x653.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>
<h3>Resize the partitions</h3>
<p>In GParted you can see a 5 GB chunk that is unallocated. This is expected because it represents the size with which we increased the disk in our VirtualBox virtual machine. The goal is to give this 5 GB unallocated disk chunk to <code>/dev/sda1</code>. So once we are all set and done, <code>/dev/sda1</code> should have a size of 23 GB instead of 18 GB. It would be nice if we could just drag and drop this unallocated disk space onto <code>/dev/sda1</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot just move a piece of the disk space like that. What we have to do instead is move the extended partition, including the swap partition, all the way to the right. This opens up 5 GB between <code>/dev/sda1</code> and <code>/dev/sda2</code>. Once it is directly on the right side of <code>/dev/sda1</code> we can increase the size of the <code>/dev/sda1</code> to include this 5 GB. Now that we know the general idea, let’s get work.</p>
<h4>Step 1 – Add the unallocated space to the extended partition</h4>
<p>Select the <code>/dev/sda2</code> extended partition in GParted and select <em>Partition</em> → <em>Resize/Move</em> from the program menu. On the dialog that appeared, select <em>None</em> from the <em>Align to</em> drop down menu. Next, resize the partition by entering a value of 0 in the <em>Free space following</em> edit box. Alternatively, you can drag the right arrow all the way to the right, in the visual representation of the partition size. Click the <em>Resize/Move</em> button to confirm the change.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="579" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_extended_partition.png" alt="GParted screenshot that shows how to add the unallocated space to the extended partition." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_extended_partition.png 800w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_extended_partition-300x217.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_extended_partition-768x556.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>
<h4>Step 2 – Move the swap partition to the right of the extended partition</h4>
<p>The unallocated disk space is now a part of the <code>/dev/sda2</code> extended partition. As a next step we move the <code>/dev/sda5</code> swap partition, which is inside the extended partition, all the way to the right. Select the <code>/dev/sda5</code> swap partition in GParted and select <em>Partition</em> → <em>Resize/Move</em> from the program menu. On the dialog that appeared, select <em>None</em> from the <em>Align to</em> drop down menu. Next, drag the swap partition all the way to the right, in the visual representation of the partition size. Alternatively, you can change the numbers directly in the edit boxes. Basically the values in <em>Free space preceding</em> and <em>Free space following</em> need to be swapped. Click the <em>Resize/Move</em> button to confirm the change. Note that you might get a warning that moving a partition might cause the operating system to fail to boot. You can ignore this warning, so just click <em>OK</em> on the warning dialog.</p>

<h4>Step 3 – Shrink the extended partition back to its original size</h4>
<p>The unallocated space still resides in the <code>/dev/sda2</code> extended partition. To remove it from the extended partition, we simply shrink …</p></div></div>

February 25, 2021 | https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/quitting-twitter/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/quitting-twitter/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    <p>I’ve only used Twitter for a few months and I did like a lot of it. The best part by far was following and listening to some incredible people. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">Patrick McKenzie</a> is one among many, but if you look at what he says on a daily basis, you’ll know what I mean. I can be endlessly entertained and learn a lot from what folks like him say.</p>
<p>There’s also the feeling of being the first one to know things. I often came across news or memes well before everyone else who wasn’t on twitter. Jan 6th, 2021 was a good example. I spent the whole day refreshing twitter, horrified by what I saw. It didn’t make a difference whether I learned of what was happening in 5 minutes or 2 hours or 2 days, but on that day I <em>needed</em> to know in real time.</p>
<p>As for tweeting myself, I did it a fair bit. Before twitter, I’d have this habit of wanting to share whatever interesting tidbit I found with at least one person. Something funny? To the college/school group chat it goes. Something to do with software? To my former flatmates. Cute animal? To my wife. Whatever I see, I know at least one friend who’d like it. I felt happy showing it to at least one other person. But I also felt a bit guilty sending them to people on 1:1 threads. Was I being too spammy? Were my ‘jokes’ not that funny? That’s where Twitter helped. I could broadcast without worrying that I was bothering people.</p>
<p>I also liked sending encouragement and appreciation to small time authors and content creators. These folks have it tough, and a kind word can always help. Twitter reduces the friction to doing this to the point where there’s no reason you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty good website, as tens of millions of people around the world can attest. I would mostly agree with them. But it wasn’t for me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-1---lack-of-reach">Problem 1 - Lack of reach</h2>
<p>It feels stupid to complain about something as trivial as a lack of followers. There are ways to get around this, chiefly by putting out interesting content. I never used hashtags much, but that’s supposedly a great way too. But I never saw much engagement with what I was saying, which meant using the website felt a bit solitary. What was the point of saying things if I was the only one reading it?</p>
<p>It’s possible that I’m a boring knob, and that’s why no one reacted to my stuff. But that’s not been my experience elsewhere. When I use reddit or Hacker News, I find that it’s trivial to get thousands of karma and a handful of awards. Pseudo-anonymity helps too - instead of a weird Indian name I use a nickname that doesn’t mean anything. It’s possible to get positive engagement and replies from people regardless of who you are. You don’t need a reputation or a following, if you said something worth reading, people will read it and appreciate.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest - I felt jealous that people could just say “hey followers, here’s a question I could have googled. Could you google it for me?” and get a response. Or “I’m looking for a job. Any leads?” I didn’t have that. Nor did I have a way of reaching that easily.</p>
<p>I think Tiktok gets it right here. No matter who the creator is, if the content is good enough it will get hundreds of thousands of views. That system feels fairer to than Twitter.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-2---pervasive-anger">Problem 2 - Pervasive anger</h2>
<p>I followed a lot of interesting people, but these folks were also upset with many things, mainly the state of the world. Watching people snipe at each other constantly, taking their anger out on anything in sight … was understandable. You can’t tell them to react differently or to chill out, because these are reasonable responses to what they’re seeing. I can’t even disagree.</p>
<p>But seeing people angry most of the time takes it’s toll too. I think it affected my mental health. Yes, I’m deeply upset with some of the things that are happening, but if I’m thinking about them 24x7 I’m not thinking about urgent things in my life that need my attention.</p>
<p>I won’t miss people dunking on each other while also not mentioning the dunkee, piquing my curiosity to the point where I investigate who the dunkee was and why. A waste of time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-3---twitter-warps-people">Problem 3 - Twitter warps people</h2>
<p>Some guy with 14k followers said something. It was something like “only Indian people are rude/assholes in this particular way. Here are some anecdotes proving this”. This is a generalisation about a race of people based on anecdotes, so by definition racist. But since the person was Indian, it’s not. Don’t look at me, I don’t make the rules.</p>
<p>Dunking on other Indian people is a common pastime for Indian people - it makes us feel superior to our compatriots. Of course we wouldn’t do the thing that we’re talking about, we’re better than that. He wasn’t doing anything I haven’t heard a hundred others do.</p>
<p>I commented that there could be sampling bias here. Since we’re more likely to be annoyed/embarassed by the actions of Indian people, we’re more likely to notice and remember it. I relayed an anecdote of my Indian friend being very annoyed by something an Indian did but not even remembering that a white person had done the exact same thing the previous day (making us wait while taking a photo). I thought it was ok to say this. I asked “You ever think this is sampling bias? You notice and get annoyed when Indians do it and embarrass you but don’t if it’s someone else?”</p>
<p>Apparently not. He went on a massive tirade. Not content with responding rudely, he quote tweets me so he can dunk in front of all his followers. Apparently, I’m jingoistic deflector, part of the “elite” that refuses to “accept and introspect” and that I “deny deny deny” legitimate issues with India. If you’ve read my other posts, you know this isn’t true. I’m the first one to point out where my country (and me personally) can do better. (<a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/understanding-my-privilege/">Understanding my Privilege</a>, <a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/discriminating-against-left-handers/">Discriminating against left handers</a>)</p>
<p>Anyway, he has 14k followers. I have 100. I wasn’t winning this one, regardless. I decided to stop responding, even though he went on and on.</p>
<p>The thing is, he’s actually a pretty good dude. I know, because I’ve followed him for months. But at some point he’s been exposed to so much trolling that he assumes that everyone who disagrees is a troll. It’s “#factcheckbait” according to him. He thought I was a troll and responded appropriately.</p>
<p>How does a reasonable, good person end up warped like this, where they assume that every person out there is a bad faith actor? Where there’s absolutely no scope for disagreement? My theory is that Twitter warps people in this way, by simply removing any scope for reasoned discussion. When you only meet trolls, and never have any friendly discussion with different viewpoints, you assume that a person disagreeing with you is a troll.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could stick around, play the game, build up by follower count to the point where I solve problem 1, prune my followee list to solve problem 2. But by then I’ve probably spent so much time there that I’ve become warped, probably without realising it - problem 3. Once I figured this out, I deactivated my account.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t permanent. The upsides of twitter still exist. I still want to read what people like Patrick McKenzie, Zach Weinersmith, John Carmack and others have to say. I still want to send encouraging messages to small time creators. But for now, I’m done.</p>

<![CDATA[systemd: Boot Loader Specification]]>

February 25, 2021 | https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p><em>TL;DR: Currently there’s no common boot scheme across architectures and
platforms for open-source operating systems. There’s also little cooperation
between multiple distributions in dual-boot (or triple, … multi-boot)
setups. We’d like to improve this situation by getting everybody to commit to a
single boot configuration format that is based on drop-in files, and thus is
robust, simple, works without rewriting configuration files and is free of
namespace clashes.</em></p>

<p>The Boot Loader Specification defines a scheme how different operating systems
can cooperatively manage a boot loader configuration directory, that accepts
drop-in files for boot menu items that are defined in a format that is shared
between various boot loader implementations, operating systems, and userspace
programs. The same scheme can be used to prepare OS media for cases where the
firmware includes a boot loader. The target audience for this specification is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boot loader developers, to write a boot loader that directly reads its configuration at runtime from these drop-in snippets</li>
  <li>Firmware developers, to add generic boot loading support directly to the firmware itself</li>
  <li>Distribution and Core OS developers, in order to create these snippets at OS/kernel package installation time</li>
  <li>UI developers, for implementing a user interface that discovers the available boot options</li>
  <li>OS Installer developers, to prepare their installation media and for setting up the initial drop-in directory</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-is-there-a-need-for-this-specification">Why is there a need for this specification?</h2>

<p>Of course, without this specification things already work mostly fine. But here’s why we think this specification is needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To make the boot more robust, as no explicit rewriting of configuration files is required any more</li>
  <li>To allow an out of the box boot experience on any platform without the need of traditional firmware mechanisms (e.g. BIOS calls, UEFI Boot Services)</li>
  <li>To improve dual-boot scenarios. Currently, multiple Linux installations tend to fight over which boot loader becomes the primary one in possession of the MBR, and only that one installation can then update the boot loader configuration of it freely. Other Linux installs have to be manually configured to never touch the MBR and instead install a chain-loaded boot loader in their own partition headers. In this new scheme as all installations share a loader directory no manual configuration has to take place, and all participants implicitly cooperate due to removal of name collisions and can install/remove their own boot menu entries at free will, without interfering with the entries of other installed operating systems.</li>
  <li>Drop-in directories are otherwise now pretty ubiquitous on Linux as an easy way to extend configuration without having to edit, regenerate or manipulate configuration files. For the sake of uniformity, we should do the same for extending the boot menu.</li>
  <li>Userspace code can sanely parse boot loader configuration which is essential with modern BIOSes which do not necessarily initialize USB keyboards anymore during boot, which makes boot menus hard to reach for the user. If userspace code can parse the boot loader configuration, too, this allows for UIs that can select a boot menu item to boot into, before rebooting the machine, thus not requiring interactivity during early boot.</li>
  <li>To unify and thus simplify configuration of the various boot loaders around, which makes configuration of the boot loading process easier for users, administrators and developers alike.</li>
  <li>For boot loaders with configuration <em>scripts</em> such as grub2, adopting this spec allows for mostly static scripts that are generated only once at first installation, but then do not need to be updated anymore as that is done via drop-in files exclusively.</li>
</ul>



<p>EFI is not ubiquitous, especially not in embedded systems. If you have an EFI
system, it provides a boot options logic that can offer similar
functionality. Here’s why we think that it is not enough for our uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The various EFI implementations implement the boot order/boot item logic to different levels. Some firmware implementations do not offer a boot menu at all and instead unconditionally follow the EFI boot order, booting the first item that is working.</li>
  <li>If the firmware setup is used to reset all data usually all EFI boot entries are lost, making the system entirely unbootable, as the firmware setups generally do not offer a UI to define additional boot items. By placing the menu item information on disk, it is always available, regardless if the BIOS setup data is lost.</li>
  <li>Harddisk images should be movable between machines and be bootable without requiring explicit EFI variables to be set. This also requires that the list of boot options is defined on disk, and not in EFI variables alone.</li>
  <li>EFI is not universal yet (especially on non-x86 platforms), this specification is useful both for EFI and non-EFI boot loaders.</li>
  <li>Many EFI systems disable USB support during early boot to optimize boot times, thus making keyboard input unavailable in the EFI menu. It is thus useful if the OS UI has a standardized way to discover available boot options which can be booted to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Everything described below is located on a placeholder file system <code>$BOOT</code>. The installer program should pick <code>$BOOT</code> according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On disks with an MBR partition table:
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, and a partition with the type id of 0xEA already exists it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, a new partition with type id of 0xEA shall be created, of a suitable size (let’s say 500MB), and it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On disks with GPT (GUID Partition Table)
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an Extended Boot Loader Partition or XBOOTLDR partition for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type GUID of <code>bc13c2ff-59e6-4262-a352-b275fd6f7172</code>, already exists, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an EFI System Partition or ESP for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type UID of <code>c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b</code>) already exists and is large enough (let’s say 250MB) and otherwise qualifies, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and if the ESP partition already exists but is too small, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) XBOOTLDR partition shall be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and no ESP partition exists yet, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) ESP should be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This placeholder file system shall be determined during <em>installation time</em>, and an fstab entry may be created. It should be mounted to either <code>/boot/</code> or <code>/efi/</code>. Additional locations like <code>/boot/efi/</code>, with <code>/boot/</code> being a separate file system, might be supported by implementations. This is not recommended because the mounting of <code>$BOOT</code> is then dependent on and requires the mounting of the intermediate file system.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em><code>$BOOT</code> should be considered <strong>shared</strong> among all OS installations of a system. Instead of maintaining one <code>$BOOT</code> per installed OS (as <code>/boot/</code> was traditionally handled), all installed OS share the same place to drop in their boot-time configuration.</em></p>

<p>For systems where the firmware is able to read file systems directly, <code>$BOOT</code>
must be a file system readable by the firmware. For other systems and generic
installation and live media, <code>$BOOT</code> must be a VFAT (16 or 32) file
system. Applications accessing <code>$BOOT</code> should hence not assume that fancier
file system features such as symlinks, hardlinks, access control or case
sensitivity are supported.</p>

<p>This specification defines two types of boot loader entries. The first type is
text based, very simple and suitable for a variety of firmware, architecture
and image types (“Type #1”). The second type is specific to EFI, but allows
single-file images that embed all metadata in the kernel binary itself, which
is useful to cryptographically sign them as one file for the purpose of
SecureBoot (“Type #2”).</p>

<p>Not all boot loader entries will apply to all systems. For example, Type #1
entries that use the <code>efi</code> key and all Type #2 entries only apply to EFI
systems. Entries using the <code>architecture</code> key might specify an architecture that
doesn’t match the local one. Boot loaders should ignore all entries that don’t
match the local platform and what the boot loader can support, and hide them
from the user. Only entries matching the feature set of boot loader and system
shall be considered and displayed. This allows image builders to put together
images that transparently support multiple different architectures.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>$BOOT</code> partition is not supposed to be exclusive territory of
this specification. This specification only defines semantics of the <code>/loader/</code>
directory inside the file system (see below), but it doesn’t intend to define
ownership of the whole file system exclusively. Boot loaders, firmware, and
other software implementing this specification may choose to place other
files and directories in the same file system. For example, boot loaders that
implement this specification might install their own boot code into the <code>$BOOT</code>
partition. On systems where <code>$BOOT</code> is the ESP this is a particularly common
setup. Implementations of this specification must be able to operate correctly
if files or directories other than <code>/loader/</code> are found in the top level
directory. Implementations that add their own files or directories to the file
systems should use well-named directories, to make name collisions between
multiple users of the file system unlikely.</p>

<h3 id="type-1-boot-loader-specification-entries">Type #1 Boot Loader Specification Entries</h3>

<p>We define two directories below <code>$BOOT</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/</code> is the directory containing all files needed for Type #1 entries</li>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/entries/</code> is the directory containing the drop-in snippets. This directory contains one <code>.conf</code> file for each boot menu item.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>In all cases the <code>/loader/</code> directory should be …</em></p></div></div>

            <p>
              June 17, 2020<br>
              
              
            </p>

            <p>Google Analytics is incredibly popular software. <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics">According to BuiltWith, 90% of the top 100,000 websites use it</a>. And if you’re a marketer, I pretty much guarantee that stat doesn’t surprise you and that you’re using GA to make significant decisions about your website and content strategy.</p>

<p>And yet, Google Analytics has always been hugely more complex than most marketers need or understand. Its data is fairly reliable, but it’s really easy to misconfigure, and more and more users are blocking analytics tools. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192?hl=en">And for anything beyond standard reporting, Google Analytics reports use sampled data</a>, which makes these reports unsuitable if you’re looking for high precision. If you’re not looking for high precision, you should also know that Google Analytics’ standard reporting is offered by lots of other tools, about which more below.</p>

<p>Do we still recommend Google Analytics? Of course – but we think responsible marketers should offer their customers a way to opt out of GA tracking, and we think it’s an interesting experiment, and useful, to think about marketing without Google Analytics.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-make-it-easy-for-users-to-opt-out-of-google-analytics">Why you should make it easy for users to opt out of Google Analytics</h2>

<p>Of course, in many countries, letting users opt out of tracking is a legal obligation – and visitors from those countries should see a cookie consent notice when they visit your site. For example, if you intend to provide services to people in the EU, <a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/">you’ll need to comply with the ePrivacy Directive</a>.</p>

<p>But there are a few more important reasons.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, we’re seeing more people object to excessive data collection, especially from Google. <strong>Users who care can easily block your tracking anyway</strong>, but by providing them a straightforward, easy way to do this, you send a signal that their privacy is important to you.</p>

<p><strong>Over the long run, we think you won’t need Google Analytics</strong>, and you certainly don’t need Google Analytics data from all of your visitors. The functionality and data that GA provides is far more than is actually needed. The result is that it’s easy to spend a lot of time setting up complex reports that don’t help you make better decisions, that may not even be accurate, and that distract you from other important sources of information – <a href="https://ercule.co/less-data-more-context">like other people in your company, or customers</a>.</p>

<p>We also think that <strong>Google Analytics will, over time, assume much less importance for web analytics</strong>. Already, tools that are privacy-focused (e.g. <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>, <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, and <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>) are starting to gain more traction.</p>

<p>Because these tools are also simpler, they’re easier to use, and in many cases they rely on underlying metrics that are easier to understand, and more reliable to collect. Now is a good time to start thinking about a post Google Analytics world, and considering what you really need from your web analytics.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-to-easily-let-your-visitors-opt-out">Javascript to easily let your visitors opt out</h2>

<p><a href="https://ercule.co/google-analytics-opt-out-javascript">We’ve written some JavaScript to make it easy to allow your visitors to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking</a>. This code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provides a text link that, when clicked, disables Google Analytics tracking on your site, for the visitor who clicked the link</li>
  <li>Stores that preference in a cookie so that when a visitor returns, Google Analytics stays disabled</li>
  <li>Allows your user to turn Google Analytics back on, if they want</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>For the moment, Google Analytics is still an important part of the marketing toolkit for most marketers. But its downsides should be recognized – in addition to data privacy issues, Google Analytics makes it easy to get lost in complex reporting that doesn’t add value to your marketing efforts. Give your users a way to easily opt out, and we recommend giving some thought to how you’ll market in a post-Google-Analytics world, too.</p>

<p>A group of researchers across the UNU, UNITAR, ITU, and ISWA[0] recently released <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Documents/Toolbox/GEM_2020_def.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Global E-waste Monitor 2020</a> report, giving us an up to date look at just how much electronic waste we’re generating around the world.&nbsp; The numbers are worrying.&nbsp; We’ve gone from 44.4 million metric tons per year in 2014 to 53.6 million metric tons in 2019.&nbsp; Even worse, another group of UN-affiliated researchers[1] published a paper called <a href="http://www.step-initiative.org/files/_documents/publications/FUTURE%20E-WASTE%20SCENARIOS_UNU_190829_low_screen.pdf">Future E-waste Scenarios</a> that projects a possible increase to 111 million metric tons by 2050.&nbsp; This assumes a scenario where economic improvements in developing countries result in consumption patterns similar to developed countries along with limited changes to the status quo around product lifecycles.</p>
<p>Numbers that large are hard to make any sense of.&nbsp; The problem feels more real when you break it down to a personal scale.&nbsp; In 2019, each of us on average is creating 7.3 kg of e-waste annually, which may grow to around 12.3 kg by 2050.&nbsp; As a rough approximation, this means that a person born in 1980 will generate around 500kg of e-waste in their lifetime, or about around eight times their own body weight.&nbsp; We can categorize those numbers further.&nbsp; Currently, around 17.4% of e-waste is properly recycled (1.4 people’s worth) and 8% is estimated to be improperly disposed of in normal waste bins (0.6 people’s worth).&nbsp; The remaining 6 people’s worth is just unknown and assumed to often be stored, dumped, incinerated, or re-processed in unsafe and environmentally unfriendly methods.</p>
<p>The UN groups are creating initiatives to boost tracking and reporting and make it easier for governments to create and maintain sound programs around recycling e-waste.&nbsp; Ultimately though, the best lever we have is to generate less waste to begin with.&nbsp; We can do that by repairing our products instead of buying new ones and by designing products to be longer lived.&nbsp; This requires companies and consumers to both embrace repair, upgradeability, and long software support lifetimes.&nbsp; We can shrink our personal piles of waste, and together, shrink the global one too.</p>
<p><em>If you’d like to help on this, we’re <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring across a range of roles</a> to fulfill our mission of making consumer electronics products long lived.</em></p>

<p>A year ago, covid was a mystery. We didn't know how it spread, we didn't know who it infected, we didn't know how to treat it. All we knew was that it was spreading fast and the early epicenters were slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>It's been a year, and now we know a lot more. One thing we know, for example, is that even though virus particles can linger for a long time on surfaces, you're not likely to catch the virus from these "fomites."</p>
<p>Simple handwashing of the sort we should have all practised all along will do the trick. You don't need to sterilize your groceries or leave your parcels to sit on your doorstep for three days. Just wash your hands!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-surfaces-spread-clean/">https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-surfaces-spread-clean/</a></p>
<p>However, in the lockdown's early days, businesses were floundering, wondering how they'd reopen, and, driven by the scant science of covid transmission, a class of highly speculative health consultant sprang into existence to promote a meticulous regime of surface cleaning.</p>
<p>Surface-cleaning is a highly visible activity, and it can feel reassuring to be handed a grocery basket whose handle is glistening with a layer of freshly applied sterilizing spray. But all of this hygiene theater is largely irrelevant to controlling the pandemic.</p>
<p>Hygiene theater isn't harmless. At the very least, it's a major distraction. Late in 2020, my kid's school district circulated a plan to reopen for in-person classes in early Jan, assuming the LA County health department permitted it (they didn't because LA is a plague-pit).</p>
<p>This email went into incredible, eye-watering detail about the school's plan to sterilize all surfaces, going so far as to mention the brand names, active ingredients and concentrations of the products that would be applied to every surface every day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plan included <em>nothing</em> about ventilation. When I wrote to the district to ask some simple questions like, "Will you unseal the windows so they can be opened while students are present?" or "Do you have any fans?" no one knew the answer.</p>
<p>Needless to say, "Have you changed the kind of HVAC filters you use?" was an unanswerable mystery. This wasn't reassuring – as school safety plans go, it was about as useless as those lock-down active shooter drills they terrorize the kids with.</p>
<p>Hygiene theater is everywhere. A friend of mine owns a 100-employee business that moved into new offices just before the pandemic. The lease includes cleaning services, and twice a week, a masked crew sweeps through the unoccupied offices and sterilizes every surface.</p>
<p>Covid science is still a moving target, obviously, but the overwhelming consensus is that masks, distance and ventilation are the most important safety measures we can take – while sterilization and surfaces are no more (or less) important than they were before the plague.</p>
<p>Of course, airflow isn't easy to demonstrate or detect (some places are experimenting with giant CO2 readouts as a proxy for ventilation), so it's getting short shrift.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/</a></p>
<p>But focusing on sanitizing because it's so visible is the epidemiological equivalent of looking for car keys under the lamppost.</p>

<p>One of the worst barriers to preserving the planet in a state suitable for human habitation is the Energy Charter Treaty, an obscure 1994 treaty with 50+ signatories that allows energy companies to sue governments over environmental protection laws.</p>
<p>The ECT has just been invoked by the German polluter RWE, which is suing the Dutch government for €1.4b over a law that bans coal plants by 2030.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-rwe-uses-energy-charter-treaty-to-challenge-dutch-coal-phase-out/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-rwe-uses-energy-charter-treaty-to-challenge-dutch-coal-phase-out/</a></p>
<p>All told, the EU faces <em>at least</em> €345b in ECT liability over its climate plans. In reality, the total could be much higher, because the ECT provides for damages equal to the value of physical plant and <em>all projected future profits</em> from those plants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2021/ect/">https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2021/ect/</a></p>
<p>€345b is double the EU's total annual operational budget. This is the ransom that the world's worst climate criminals are demanding that Europeans pay as a condition of continuing to have a habitable planet. Big Energy want to be rewarded for its crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Every day the treaty remains in effect produces more liability. Under ECT's provisions, a country that pulls out of the agreement is still liable for <em>twenty years</em> for any laws that affect the profitability of energy products started while the country was still in the ECT.</p>
<p>When a country is sued by a multinational for improving its environmental protections, the case is tried by a star-chamber of corporate lawyers who meet in secret and overwhelmingly find in favor of polluters.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, this is not a stable situation. To keep countries from fleeing the ECT, the energy cartel has embarked on a "modernization" project that it has slow-walked since 2017, with help from Japan, whose worst polluters depend on ECT to operate with impunity.</p>
<p>It's not hard to grind negotiations to a halt – all you need is a requirement that every decision must be unanimous before work can proceed. Leaks show this gambit is why the "modernization" meetings have been a four-year, do-nothing talking shop:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/energy-charter-treaty-reform-reaches-milestone-with-little-progress-to-show/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/energy-charter-treaty-reform-reaches-milestone-with-little-progress-to-show/</a></p>
<p>The harms of ECT aren't limited to direct vast transfers of public money to polluters. ECT is a major reason we don't get meaningful climate action in the first place: such legislation dies in planning once its authors are warned that it will trigger ECT enforcement action.</p>
<p>The arguments in favor of ECT are risible FUD, as Fabian Flues, Cecilia Olivet and Pia Eberhardt document for Opendemocracy.</p>

<p>Take the argument that the ECT spurs investment in renewables: a meta-analysis of 74 papers concludes that this effect is "so small as to be considered zero" (in reality, the majority of ECT-attributable investment is in dirty fossil fuel power).</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12392">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12392</a></p>
<p>Or the argument that since quitting ECT leaves countries exposed for 20 years, there's no point. Recall that this 20 year overhang only applies to projects begun <em>before</em> the country leaves the ECT, so the sooner countries quit it, the less risk they face.</p>
<p>Such risk as does exist can be mitigated by countries quitting in a bloc, making a mutual promise to ban companies domiciled in their borders from making any claims under the ECT, using national law to prohibit ECT action. The EU could mitigate much of its risk this way.</p>
<p>That the ECT even exists is a bad joke. It can't be fixed through "modernization" (especially not the current modernization plan, which doesn't touch corporate courts or contemplate any exemptions for climate regulation).</p>
<p>300 EU lawmakers have signed a petition calling on the EU to leave the ECT.</p>

    <p><em>Note: This post is adapted in part from my guide to contributing to the Git
project, which you can read
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/MyFirstContribution.txt">here</a>.
I owe my thanks to my reviewers there, including Junio C. Hamano, Johannes
Schindelin, Jonathan Tan, Josh Steadmon, and Phil Hord.</em></p>

<p>Five weeks ago, I joined a new team at Google, and began contributing to a new
project: <a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a>. I was (and still am) thrilled to be
working on a piece of software used by countless developers across the globe!
To gain a deep knowledge of a tool I’ve evangelized for so long!</p>

<p>But then I subscribed to the mailing list, and it truly began to sink in to me
that for the forseeable future, I could expect my mailbox to look something like
this:</p>

<p><img src="https://nasamuffin.github.io/assets/how-i-learned-to-love-email-patches/patches-inbox.png" alt="An inbox overflowing with patches."></p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<h2 id="out-of-my-element">Out of My Element</h2>

<p>When I started writing code professionally, I worked on a team that used Gerrit.
I liked it well enough that I continued to recommend it when asked; an iterative
review UI based on Git, who could ask for more? At my next company, code reviews
were performed by another developer examining your ClearCase checkout and
sending you an email about it (yikes). Later I was asked to evaluate Team
Foundation Server’s built-in review tooling for another company, on a team which
insisted that “code reviews take valuable developer time” - and, as a result,
generally didn’t perform them. Then I was lucky to fall back into a team using
Git alongside a proprietary review tool, and then, back to my roots: Git and
Gerrit on <a href="https://openbmc.org/">OpenBMC</a>, and Gerrit for our internal fork, too.</p>

<p>This whole time, I figured no matter how bad the review process was, at least it
wasn’t emailed patches. Why does anybody still use that terrible workflow? Who
would want to review a diff line-by-line in their email client?!</p>

<p>I was envisioning someone painstakingly copying a diff from an email body and
pasting it into <code>apply</code>. Or carefully making a second copy of the altered file
and running <code><span>diff -u</span></code>, and then handwriting the subject and commit message.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody does that. It’s absolutely true that no developer today - let
alone the bash-happy Unix devs of yesteryear - would use that workflow. With
some tooling and good practices, I found a workflow that I love - and found
myself arguing in defense of emailed patches!</p>

<h2 id="git-format-patch-to-the-rescue"><code>git format-patch</code> to the Rescue</h2>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, since the Git project itself is organized via emailed
patches, Git has some excellent built-in tooling for preparing your commits for
the inbox. <code>git format-patch</code> is the most notable - with it you can prepare an
entire branch for mailing, include a cover letter, indicate a Request for
Comment change, generate updated v2 or later patches, and more.</p>

<p>It’s easiest to use <code>git format-patch</code> if you’ve been working in a feature
branch (which you always do, right..?) - for the purposes of the tutorial, we’ll
assume the main branch of the project is <code>master</code> and your feature branch is
<code>feature</code>; we’ll also assume that <code>feature</code> has been recently rebased onto the
tip of <code>master</code>.</p>



<p>Imagine that you’ve got only one commit in your feature branch. Typically
projects like to see individual patches sent as a single email with no cover,
with a subject like “[PATCH] component: my great feature”. Make sure that your
working tree is clean - that is, everything you want committed is committed -
and run the following.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell_session"><span>$</span> git format-patch <span>-o</span> feature-patches/ master..feature</code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it! <code>-o feature-patches/</code> tells Git that you want your patchfile in the
<code>feature-patches/</code> directory, and <code>master..feature</code> tells Git you want patches
for the diff between <code>master</code> and <code>feature</code> - which in this case should be only
one commit.</p>

<p>Now take a look in <code>feature-patches/</code>. You should see a single file named
something like <code>0001-component-my-great-feature.patch</code>. If you open it up in
your favorite editor (I like Vim), you’ll see an email header, your commit
message, a diffspec, and a unified diff indicating your changes.</p>

<p>Ideally, your commit message should say everything there is to be said about
your patch. But sometimes, there’s some context you want to add that isn’t
appropriate for a commit message - for example, maybe you want to warn everyone
that you won’t be addressing comments until next week as you’re visiting your
aunt in Mallorca and she doesn’t like to give out her wifi password. In that
case, look for the <code>---</code> above the diffspec - you can provide your additional
message there. It will look something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="email">From 1345bbb3f7ac74abde040c12e737204689a72723 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Dev Eloper &lt;developer@cool.website&gt;
Date: Thu, 18 Apr 2019 15:11:02 -0700
Subject: [PATCH] README: change the grammar

I think it looks better this way. This part of the commit message will
end up in the commit-log.

Signed-off-by: Dev Eloper &lt;developer@cool.website&gt;
---
I welcome everyone's comments on this change, however, I will be unable
to answer until next Friday. My aunt still insists that if she gives me
her wifi password I will hack the Pentagon from her cottage.

<p>Great. You can see in the example which parts of the email will be retained as
a commit message, and which parts will be ignored by <code>git am</code>. If you’re not
sure how it will look, you can always try running it through <code>git am</code> yourself
to have a look at the resulting commit.</p>

<p><em>If your organization likes even single-commit changes to contain a cover letter
you can just use the instructions in the next section.</em></p>



<p>If you’ve been working on a much larger feature and your branch has a number of
commits, you can still use <code>git format-patch</code> pretty easily. Like before, make
sure your working tree is clean and your commits are all in order, then run</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell_session"><span>$</span> git format-patch <span>--cover-letter</span> <span>-o</span> feature-patches/ master..feature</code></pre></figure>

<p>Have a look in <code>feature-patches/</code>. You should see n+1 patch files (where n is
the number of commits you have on top of master). Most of them will reflect the
subject lines of your patches, but there will be one named beginning with
0000 - that’s your cover letter. Go ahead and open it in your favorite editor.</p>

<p>You should see that it’s already got a template, including some email headers
and a diffstat. Change the subject line to something that summarizes your entire
feature, taking care to preserve the “[PATCH 0/X]” portion. You can also include
context in the body of the cover letter to explain anything about the patchset
which wasn’t appropriate for inclusion into the commit messages. For a larger
changeset, this is typically the place where you explain what your feature is
<em>as a whole</em>.</p>

<p>If you examine the other patches, you will see that they are all marked
In-Reply-To the Message-Id of your cover letter. This is good and what most
communities prefer, but you can change the behavior with the <code>--thread</code>
argument.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Resist the urge to edit the diff in the patch directly. The diff contains some
line number information that needs to match up and is hard to fudge by hand.
Plus, your local tree will get out-of-sync with what you’re sending upstream.</li>
  <li>The timestamp at the top of the patch is special and indicates that the patch
was generated with <code>git format-patch</code>; don’t touch it.</li>
  <li>The build number at the bottom indicates which version of Git you used to
generate the patch; you can delete this if you are feeling the need for
privacy.</li>
  <li>The area below the <code>---</code> or the cover letter in v2 or later patches is a great
spot for you to explain what changed between the previous version and this
one. Your reviewer could use an interdiff to figure it out, but it’s kind to
give them a hint.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="show-them-what-you-got-git-send-email">Show Them What You Got: <code>git send-email</code></h2>

<p><em>Note: One thing this tutorial won’t cover is how to download and configure
<code>git send-email</code>. Not because it’s hard, or trivial, but because setup steps
vary quite a bit depending on your system and email client. <code>send-email</code> is
often not packaged with base Git; you may have to install it separately. This
tutorial assumes you’ve already got it up and running.</em></p>

<p>After the steps in the previous section, you should have one or more patch
files in your <code>feature-patches/</code> directory, and you should also have examined
your patches to ensure that they look perfect and ready for review. Sending them
is as simple as this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell_session"><span>$</span> git send-email <span>--to</span><span>=</span>mailing-list@project.org feature-patches/<span>*</span>.patch</code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it! Your patches are out and your reviews should come pouring in. (Okay,
maybe “trickling” is a better word.)</p>



<p><em>Note: As with Gerrit and other iterative code review tools based around a Git
workflow, making your changes involves using interactive rebase. I won’t cover
that here, as it’s not significantly different from other processes, and it’s
complex enough to take its own tutorial.</em></p>

<p>Your reviewers will likely provide their comments inline, and it’s often good
manners to reply to each review comment indicating whether you’ve taken an
action or not. When I’m replying to review comments, I like to have a window
open with a reply to the email, and another window open with my code. I make
sure that I’ve begun an interactive rebase and paused to edit the commit I’m
examining comments for, and then I open my source file. As I read comments in
the email, I make a change as appropriate in my source, then type a response
inline to the comment in question. (That way I know I didn’t miss anything!)</p>

<p>When you’ve addressed all the comments for a certain patch, make sure to <code>git
add -u &amp;&amp; git commit --amend</code> to update your commit with the changes. Once
you’ve updated your entire branch this way, you’re ready to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

When they type a keyword into your website's search bar, they expect to find logically ranked results, including related matches and misspellings.</p>
<p>Because users are used to these sophisticated search systems, developers have to build applications that use more than simple <code>LIKE</code> queries. </p>

    </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Postgres Full Text Search</a> has been available since Postgres 8.3. It can be used to <strong>find records based on semantics and knowledge of the language</strong> rather than simple string matching, is very flexible, and unlike other search options such as <code>LIKE</code>, it performs well for partial matches.</p>
<p>While <code>LIKE</code> can be supported by indexes, that usually won’t work well when the <code>%</code> operator is used on the left side of the search term. Typically this means the query planner reverts to sequential scans when using wildcard operators like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title <span>FROM</span> film <span>WHERE</span> description <span>LIKE</span> <span>'%brilliant'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When searching multiple columns, you also have additional effort, as each column needs to be queried separately using <code>LIKE</code>. There are more flexible alternatives, such as <code>SIMILAR TO</code> and POSIX regular expression search, but those are still difficult to use when you want to catch different variations of a word (e.g., word variations like “jump,” “jumps,” “jumped,” and “jumping”).</p>
<p>Because <code>LIKE</code> and other simple methods lack language support and cannot handle word variations or ranking, Postgres Full Text Search (FTS) is generally a better option when implementing search directly in the database. With FTS, your searches will match all instances of the word, its plural, and the word's various tenses. Because FTS is bundled into Postgres, there’s no need to install extra software and no extra cost for using a third-party search provider. Additionally, all your data are stored in one place, which reduces your web application’s complexity.</p>
<p>This article will show you how to use Full Text Search in raw PostgreSQL queries and implement equivalent queries in Django using the Postgres driver. Along the way, you’ll see some of the use cases for the various Full Text Search methods that Postgres provides.</p>

<p>Before a text or document can be searched using FTS, you need to convert it to an acceptable data type, known as a <code>tsvector</code>. To convert plain text to a <code>tsvector</code>, use the Postgres <code>to_tsvector</code> function. This function reduces the original text to a set of word skeletons known as lexemes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme">Lexemes</a> are important because they help match related words. For instance, the words <em>satisfy</em>, <em>satisfying</em> and <em>satisfied</em> would convert to <em>satisfi</em>. This means a search for <em>satisfy</em> will return results containing any of the other terms as well. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-dictionaries.html#TEXTSEARCH-STOPWORDS">Stop words</a> such as “a,” “on,” “of,” “you,” “who,” etc. are removed because they appear too frequently to be relevant in searches. The <code>to_tsvector</code> function returns the lexemes, along with a digit that denotes each word’s position in the text.</p>
<p>Note that the output of the function is language-dependent. You should tell PostgreSQL to treat the text as English (or whatever language your results are stored in). To convert the sentence “A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank” to a <code>tsvector</code>, run the following:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll see output like the following:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'chase':12 'documentari':3 'fanci':2 'frisbe':6 'lumberjack':9 'monkey':14 'must':11 'shark':17 'tank':18</code></pre></div>
<p>This shows each word’s root as well as its position in the text. For example, the word fanciful, the second word in the text, has been broken down into the lexeme “fanci”, so you see <code>’fanci’:2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tsquery-data-type"><a href="#tsquery-data-type" aria-label="tsquery data type permalink"></a>tsquery data type</h3>
<p>Text search systems have two major components: the text being searched and the keyword being searched for. In the case of FTS, both components must be vectorized. You saw how searchable data is converted to a <code>tsvector</code> in the previous section, so now you’ll see how search terms are vectorized into <code>tsquery</code> values.</p>
<p>Postgres offers functions that will convert text fields to <code>tsquery</code> values such as <code>to_tsquery</code>, <code>plainto_tsquery</code> and <code>phraseto_tsquery</code>. Search terms can also be combined with the <code>&amp;</code> (AND), <code>|</code> (OR), and <code>!</code> (NOT) operators, and parentheses can be used to group operators and determine their order. <code>to_tsquery</code> converts the search terms to tokens and discards stop words.</p>
<p>The following query:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a &amp; beautifully &amp; very &amp; quickly'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Returns the lexemes “beauti” and “quick” because “a” and “very” are stop words:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'beauti' &amp; 'quick'</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="searching"><a href="#searching" aria-label="searching permalink"></a>Searching</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to create a <code>tsvector</code> from your text data and a <code>tsquery</code> from your search terms, you can perform a full-text search using the <code>@@</code> operator.</p>
<p>For example, you can run the following query to compare two strings:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'John''s performance was found wanting'</span><span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'want'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This query returns <code>TRUE</code>, indicating that there was a match: <code>want</code>.</p>
<p>If you had a <code>film</code> table containing movie titles and descriptions, you could use Full Text Search to find all films with a description containing the word <em>epic</em> and either of the words <em>tale</em> or <em>story</em>:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title<span>,</span> description <span>FROM</span> film
<span>WHERE</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span>description<span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'epic &amp; (story | tale)'</span><span>)</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This would give you results similar to this:</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h3 id="ranking"><a href="#ranking" aria-label="ranking permalink"></a>Ranking</h3>
<p>Ranking search results can ensure that the most relevant results are shown first. Postgres provides <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">two functions for ranking</a> search results: <code>ts_rank</code> and <code>ts_rankcd</code>. <code>ts_rank</code> considers the frequency of words, while <code>ts_rank_cd</code> (“cd” means “coverage density”) considers the position of search terms within the text being searched.</p>
<p>If you run the following query, you’ll see that <code>rank1</code> and <code>rank2</code> are ranked the same (<code>0.06078271</code>) because each search query is found once in the sentence:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank2<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The more tokens that match the text, the higher the rank. In the following example, <code>rank1</code> has a higher rank than <code>rank2</code> because the tokens “elephant” and “dolphin” are both found in the sentence while “snake” is not:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant &amp; dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin &amp; snake'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank2<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="weighting"><a href="#weighting" aria-label="weighting permalink"></a>Weighting</h3>
<p>You can also give relevance to some factors over others by weighing them. For instance, when searching the film table, the highest weight could be given to the movie title and less weight could be given to the description using the <code>setweight</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>
<span>SELECT</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> weight<span>;</span>


<span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> elephant_rank<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> dolphin_rank<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>elephant_rank</code> is ranked higher because it matched elephant which has a higher weight of A, compared to dolphin_rank which has a weight of B.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>| elephant_rank | dolphin_rank |
|---------------|--------------|
| 0.6079271     | 0.24317084   |</code></pre></div>
<p><code>ts_rank</code> takes an optional first argument, <strong>weight</strong>. When this argument is left empty, it defaults to “{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0}” in the order D, C, B, A. By default, A has the highest weight of 1.0, B has 0.4, C has 0.2, and D has 0.1. You can set the weight of any of A, B, C, or D to a different value using any decimal between -0.1 and 1.0. This allows you to have fine-grained control over how results are returned and ensure that users see the right results for their queries.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen how to use Postgres’ Full Text Search functions, you’re ready to start applying these ideas to your Django app.</p>
<h2 id="using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django"><a href="#using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django" aria-label="using postgresql full text search in django permalink"></a>Using PostgreSQL Full Text Search in Django</h2>
<p>Using Postgres’ Full Text Search in Django is an ideal way to add accurate and fast search because it is easy to maintain and fast to work with. To demonstrate Full Text Search in Django, consider a PostgreSQL database <code>dvdrental</code>, with a <code>film</code> table, and an equivalent <code>Film</code> model in a Django application implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> Models

<span>class</span> <span>Film</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    film_id <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>AutoField<span>(</span>primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    title <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>255</span><span>)</span>
    description <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>TextField<span>(</span>blank<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> null<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>', '</span><span>.</span>join<span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'film_id='</span> <span>+</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span>self<span>.</span>film_id<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'title='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>title<span>,</span> <span>'description='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>description<span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the remainder of this article, you’ll see how to search a single database table field, search multiple fields, rank search results, and optimize the performance of Full text Search using vector fields and indexes. You can run the commands from your <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">Python shell</a>.</p>

<p>This is an example machine learning image recognition stack using AWS Lambda Container Images. Lambda container images can include more source assets than traditional ZIP packages (10 GB vs 250 MB image sizes), allowing for larger ML models to be used.</p>
<p>This example contains an AWS Lambda function that uses the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html">Open Images Dataset</a> <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> model to detect objects in an image. When you invoke the /detector API route with a URL to an image the function will download the image, use the TensorFlow model to detect objects in it, then return an annotated version of the image back to the client.</p>

        </deckgo-highlight-code><h2>How to</h2>
<p>The repository contains a complete example stack that can be imported directly into Stackery and deployed. The rest of this post walks you through building your own ML stack using Stackery.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup">create an AWS account</a> if you don't have one. Don't worry, everything we will do in this example will fit into the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">AWS Free Tier</a>, and even if you do not qualify for the free tier you will incur fractions of a penny's worth of expense running this example stack.</li>
<li>Second, create a <a href="https://stackery.io/sign-up">free Stackery account</a>. We will use Stackery to build the app and then deploy it into your AWS account.</li>
<li>Follow the steps after creating your Stackery account to link your AWS account. This gives Stackery permissions to package functions and generate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html">Change Sets</a> but does not give Stackery permission to arbitrarily modify resources in your AWS account. You can find more details here: <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/security-permissions-and-controls">Stackery Permissions &amp; Controls</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a new stack</h3>
<ol>
<li>Once you have linked your AWS account it's time to start creating a new stack! Go to <a href="https://app.stackery.io/stacks">Stacks</a> and click the green <strong>Add a Stack</strong> button. This will create a new, untitled stack for you.<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/4ho9a2SZQIWakGiuEp7z" alt="Creating stacks inside Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>First things first, let's give our stack a name. Click the three dots next to the current stack's name (the current name will be something like <em>Untitled</em> or <em>Untitled-1</em>) and choose to <strong>Rename</strong> the stack. Now, pick a name (<em>ml-image-recognition</em> would work!) and save it.</li>
<li>Before we go any further, why don't we save our progress? Click the big green <strong>Save with Git...</strong> button to authenticate to your favorite Git provider, create a new repo for the stack, and commit our starting stack.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Add a new HTTP API</h3>
<ol>
<li>We see a blank canvas for our new stack. Let's add an HTTP API! Click the green <strong>Add Resource</strong> button in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the <strong>HTTP API</strong> resource in the palette to add a new API to our stack. Close the palette.<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/zPb0V4ZAQPSVPUorDNKH" alt="Adding resources in Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>Double-click the new HTTP API (note: don't double click the <em>GET /</em> route, that opens the route settings instead of the API settings).<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/6jgSqV5XTjmSAkLVivuV" alt="An HTTP API inside Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>Change the route from <em>GET /</em> to <em>GET /detector</em>.</li>
<li>Click the big, green <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the settings panel.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Add a new function</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Now let's add a Lambda function! Again, click the green <strong>Add Resource</strong> button in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the <strong>Function</strong> resource in the palette to add a new Function to our stack. Close the palette.</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click the new Function to edit its settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical ID: Something descriptive, like <em>Recognizer</em></li>
<li>Package Type: Docker Image (so we can fit a large ML model into our source assets!)</li>
<li>Docker Build Context: You probably want to update this from <em>/src/Function</em> to something like <em>/src/Recognizer</em></li>
<li>Timeout: 120 (it takes a while for TensorFlow to spin up!)</li>
<li>Don't forget to click the big, green <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the settings panel!<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/uWK7xv9HSOmjQlhVkCNi" alt="Step6 .jpg"></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Save the stack by clicking the <strong>Commit...</strong> button. This is a great opportunity to see what we've added to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a> template by opening the Template Diff panel. Notice how a bunch of additional resources, like an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS ECR</a> container image repository and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">CodeBuild</a> project, are scaffolded to support building and running your new Function?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Edit your sources</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now it's time to get our feet wet on the source code side! Pull down the stack's Git repo to edit it using your favorite editor / IDE.</li>
<li>Scaffolded in the repo will be your function's source folder and Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will have a lot of possible starting points for you to choose from. We're going to build a Python Function, so you can take a look at the default Python Dockerfile commands. But since we're building a specific implementation, delete what's in the Dockerfile and replace it with the following:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="bash">
                    <code slot="code"># Download the Open Images TensorFlow model and extract it to the `model`
# folder.
FROM alpine AS builder
RUN mkdir model
RUN wget -c https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-modules/google/openimages_v4/ssd/mobilenet_v2/1.tar.gz -O - | tar xz -C model
# Make sure it's world-readable so the Lambda service user can access it.
RUN chmod -R a+r model

# Build the runtime image from the official AWS Lambda Python base image.
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python
# Copy the extracted Open Images model into the source code space.
COPY --from=builder model model
# Copy in the sources.
COPY handler.py requirements.txt ./
# Copy the OpenSans font for annotation use
COPY font ./font
# Install the Python dependencies
RUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Tell the Lambda runtime where the function handler is located.
CMD ["handler.lambda_handler"]
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code></li>
<li>Now add the Python dependencies by putting the following into requirements.txt:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="javascript">
                    <code slot="code">requests
tensorflow
Pillow
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code></li>
<li>Lastly, add the Function handler source code into handler.py:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="python">

    <div>

        <div>
          <h4>Will I like this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    I think you will, yes! However, since we probably haven't met, I'm not a particularly good judge of that.
	    Rather than trust me, read one of the sections available online
	    (my favorites are <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes">Staff engineer archetypes</a>
	    and <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters">Work on what matters</a>),
	    and one or two of the interviews (I'd recommend <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/ras-kasa-williams">Kasa's</a>
	      and <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/michelle-bu">Michelle's</a>).
        </p></div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Why write this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    There isn't much out there about being a senior technical leader outside of the management career track.
	    As I've worked with more folks in Staff and Principal engineer roles, this lack of guidance became
	    a point of friction for both them in self-directing their professional development and for me in trying to support
	    their growth. I wrote this book to become a more effective partner for the Staff engineers I work with,
	    and with the hope that it can help others who are chating their path to technical leadership
	    within an organization that's still figuring out how to support them.
	    </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Are you the right author for this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    The role and career of Staff engineers is a topic that deserves to be written about far more than it is written about!
	    My hope is that this book is useful enough that more folks start to write about it,
	    and hopefully quickly surpass this book with better, more useful books of their own.
	  </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Will this advice apply to my company?</h4>
          <p>
	    Advice without context should always be taken with a grain of salt!
	    This book is based on more than a dozen interviews with folks operating in Staff engineer, or equivalent, roles,
	    along with my personal experience leading engineering organizations at Calm, Stripe, and Uber.
	    My hope is that this broad perspective will make the book applicable to your experience,
	    although aspects of the advice are undeniably United States-centric and Silicon Valley-centric.

            </div>

            <h2>Bitcoin as a currency</h2>

<p>As of today (2021-02-25), 1 Bitcoin (BTC) is worth 50,863 US Dollars (USD).  In comparison, 5 years ago 1 BTC bought you 416 USD. [1]</p>

<p>Imagine if there was a fictional country on the border of the USA, called "Bitlandia", that uses BTC as its official currency.  Imagine we have a business person in Bitlandia who is selling a product to customers across the border in the USA.  If that business personal was selling their product for 1 BTC:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 years ago, that product would cost someone in the USA 416 USD to buy.</li>
<li>Today, that product would cost someone in the USA 50,863 USD to buy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spotting this obvious problem affecting businesses in Bitlandia, the <em>Central Bank of Bitlandia</em> steps in, and starts to print currency in order to increase the supply of Bitcoins, and therefore reduce their value as they become less scarce.  Gradually an equilibrium is restored, and our Bitlandia businesses can continue to trade is their BTC currency as it stabilizes.</p>

<p>By design however, this is not possible with BTC, as:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no "Central Bank" or indeed any central control over the currency.  That's the whole point of having a distributed blockchain, or cryptographic ledger, at the heart of BTC: <em>nobody controls that</em>.</li>
<li>There is no easy way to print large amounts of BTC in a short time.  Mining new Bitcoins is deliberately expensive, in terms of the server computation resources required, and it is getting more expensive all of the time.  Vast amounts of data center resources and electricity are already operating 24/7 around the World mining BTC.</li>
</ol>

<p>So you can now see the situation we have arrived at today: huge inflation in BTC price, and no mechanism in place to reduce that via an increased supply.  The BTC price is getting squeezed up by demand-pull and cost-push inflation, AT THE SAME TIME.</p>

<p><span>"</span>The BTC price is getting squeezed up by demand-pull and cost-push inflation, AT THE SAME TIME.<span>"</span></p>

<p>As a business or as a consumer, using BTC to actually conduct transactions is becoming less and less attractive, when for example you are getting paid your salary in USD or EURO each month, and converting those currencies into BTC is prohibitively expensive at the current price.</p>

<p>Therefore as a currency for actually buying and selling goods and services in, day to day, BTC has failed.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin as an asset</h2>

<p>So the logical thing to do now with BTC is to horde it.  After all, why buy a pizza with something so valuable, when in one week from now you can buy five or ten pizzas for the same BTC amount?  It no longer makes financial sense to spend BTC.</p>

<p>As an investor, if I bought 1 BTC for 416 USD five years ago, I would have an amazing return of 50,863 USD today!</p>

<p>As a speculative asset to buy and to hold, BTC is great <em>for as long as the price goes up</em>.  Like any other investment, its risky.</p>

<p>But please lets stop calling it a currency, its not, its an asset.</p>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

This is a brief introduction to CLOS that says enough for someone who
already knows something about Common Lisp to start using CLOS.

<p>CLOS stands for Common Lisp Object System and is pronounced "see
loss" or "kloss".  (Opinions differ as to which is right.)  CLOS is
the part of Common Lisp that is directly concerned with the usual
features of object-oriented programming, such as classes and methods.
CLOS contains a number of complex and powerful features, but it is not
necessary to understand all of CLOS in order to use it effectively.
The basic parts of CLOS, which will be covered here, include pretty
much everything you'd find in a typical object-oriented language, plus
a few other things, and are sufficient for a wide range of
applications.

</p><p>When using CLOS, we will want to do three things:
</p><ol>
<li>Define classes.
</li><li>Construct objects that are instances of classes.
</li><li>Define methods and generic functions.
</li></ol>

<p>We can do these things using only three new constructs: <tt>defclass</tt>
for defining classes, <tt>make-instance</tt> for constructing instances,
and <tt>defmethod</tt> for defining methods.  <tt>defstruct</tt> can also
be used to define classes, but it is more limited than <tt>defclass</tt>.

</p><p>It's important to know how CLOS fits into the rest of Common
Lisp.  It turns out that all Common Lisp data objects are instances
of classes.  Consequently, you can define methods for all kinds of
existing object types (such as numbers, hash-tables, and vectors);
you don't have to use <tt>defclass</tt> at all before defining
methods.  Moreover, the objects created using <tt>defclass</tt>
and <tt>make-instance</tt> can be used with ordinary Lisp functions,
not only with methods.

</p><p>To find the class of an object, use the function <tt>class-of</tt>.
For example:

<table>

<tbody><tr><th>Expression</th> <th>Value</th></tr>

<tr><td><tt>(class-of 'a)</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class SYMBOL&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of "a")</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class STRING&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of 12)</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class INTEGER&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of '(a b))</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class CONS&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of '#(a b c))</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class VECTOR&gt;</tt></td>

</tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>In the rest of this document, we will often specify the syntax
of something in Common Lisp.  Here are the conventions used in these
descriptions.  Upper case names such as <tt>DEFCLASS</tt> are literals,
but upper case is just to distinguish them from syntactic variables:
you do not have to type them in upper case.  Lower case is used for
syntactic variables.  "Thing*" means zero or more occurrences of
thing; "thing+" means one or more.  Curly brackets { and } are used
for grouping, as in {a b}+, which means a b, a b a b, a b a b a b,
etc.

</p><h2><a name="defclass">Defining classes</a></h2>

You define a class with <tt>defclass</tt>:

<pre>(DEFCLASS class-name (superclass-name*)
  (slot-description*)
  class-option*)
</pre>

For simple things, forget about class options.  We will say nothing
more about them here.

<p>A slot-description has the form <tt>(slot-name slot-option*)</tt>,
where each option is a keyword followed by a name, expression, or
whatever.  The most useful slot options are

</p><pre>   :ACCESSOR function-name
   :INITFORM expression
   :INITARG symbol
</pre>

Initargs are usually keywords that correspond to slot names.
For instance, the initarg for the slot <tt>name</tt> would be
<tt>:name</tt>.

<p><tt>Defclass</tt> is similar to <tt>defstruct</tt>, but the syntax
is a bit different, and you have more control over what things are
called.  For instance, consider this definition:

</p><pre>(defstruct person
  (name 'bill)
  (age 10))
</pre>

<tt>Defstruct</tt> would automatically define slots with expressions
to compute default initial values, access-functions like
<tt>person-name</tt> and <tt>person-age</tt> to get and set slot
values, and a <tt>make-person</tt> that took keyword initialization
arguments (initargs) as in

<pre>(make-person :name 'george :age 12)
</pre>

A <tt>defclass</tt> that provided similar access functions, etc, would be:

<pre>(defclass person ()
  ((name :accessor person-name
         :initform 'bill
         :initarg :name)
   (age :accessor person-age
        :initform 10
        :initarg :age)))
</pre>

Note that <tt>defclass</tt> lets you control what things are
called.  For instance, you don't have to call the accessor
<tt>person-name</tt>.  You can call it <tt>name</tt>, or
<tt>object-name</tt>, or pretty much whatever you want.

<p>In general, you should pick names that make sense for a group of
related classes rather than rigidly following the <tt>defstruct</tt>
conventions.

</p><p>You do not have to provide all options for every slot.  Maybe you
don't want it to be possible to initialize a slot when calling
<tt>make-instance</tt> (for which see <a href="#instances">below</a>).
In that case, don't provide an <tt>:initarg</tt>.  Or maybe there
isn't a meaningful default value.  (Perhaps the meaningful values
will always be specified by a subclass.)  In that case, no
<tt>:initform</tt>.

</p><p>Note that classes are objects.  To get the class object from its
name, use 

</p><pre>(FIND-CLASS name)
</pre>

Ordinarily, you won't need to do this.


<h2><a name="instances">Instances</a></h2>

You can make an instance of a class with <tt>make-instance</tt>.  It's
similar to the <tt>make-</tt><var>x</var> functions defined by
<tt>defstruct</tt> but lets you pass the class to instantiate as an
argument:

<pre>(MAKE-INSTANCE class {initarg value}*)
</pre>

Instead of the class object itself, you can use its name.
For example:

<pre>(make-instance 'person :age 100)
</pre>

This person object would have age 100 and name <tt>bill</tt>, the default.

<p>It's often a good idea to define your own constructor functions,
rather than call <tt>make-instance</tt> directly, because you can hide
implementation details and don't have to use keyword parameters for
everything.  For instance, if you wanted the name and age to be
required, positional parameters, rather than keyword parameters, 
you could define

</p><pre>(defun make-person (name age)
  (make-instance 'person :name name :age age))
</pre>

The accessor functions can be used to get and set slot values:

<pre>cl&gt; (setq p1 (make-instance 'person :name 'jill :age 100))
#&lt;person @ #x7bf826&gt; 

cl&gt; (person-name p1)
jill 

cl&gt; (person-age p1)
100 

cl&gt; (setf (person-age p1) 101)
101 

cl&gt; (person-age p1)
101 
</pre>

Note that when you use <tt>defclass</tt>, the instances are 
printed using the <tt>#&lt;...&gt;</tt> notation, rather than as 
<code>#s(person :name jill :age 100)</code>.
But you can change the way instances are printed by defining 
methods on the generic function <tt>print-object</tt>.

<p>Slots can also be accessed by name using 

</p><pre>(SLOT-VALUE instance slot-name)
</pre>

Note that using <tt>slot-value</tt> reveals that the value is
stored in a slot.  Accessors are more abstract since they reveal
less and don't <em>have</em> to access slots.  Since accessors
are functions (indeed, <a href="#generic">generic functions</a>
as described below), they can be (re)defined to obtain their
value some other way.  If you decide that a value should no
longer be stored in a slot, and e.g. computed as needed instead, 
you can change the access function without having to change
all the code that calls it.

<p>Here's an example of <tt>slot-value</tt>:

</p><pre>cl&gt; (slot-value p1 'name)
jill 
 
cl&gt; (setf (slot-value p1 'name) 'jillian)
jillian 

cl&gt; (person-name p1)
jillian 
</pre>

You can find out various things about an instance by calling
<code>describe</code>:

<pre>cl&gt; (describe p1)
#&lt;person @ #x7bf826&gt; is an instance of class 
     #&lt;clos:standard-class person @ #x7ad8ae&gt;:
The following slots have :INSTANCE allocation:
age     101
name    jillian
</pre>

Different implementations of Common Lisp will show such information
in different ways and may also differ in the details of what appears
in the <tt>#&lt;...&gt;</tt> notation.

<h2><a name="slots">Inheritance of slot options</a></h2>

The class above had no superclass.  That's why there was a
"<tt>()</tt>" after "<tt>defclass</tt> <tt>person</tt>".  Actually,
this means it has one superclass: <tt>standard-object</tt>.

<p>When there are superclasses, a subclass can specify a slot that has
already been specified for a superclass.  When this happens, the
information in slot options has to be combined.  For the slot options
listed above, either the option in the subclass overrides the one in
the superclass or there is a union:

</p><pre>   :ACCESSOR  -  union
   :INITARG   -  union
   :INITFORM  -  overrides
</pre>

This is what you should expect.  The subclass can <em>change</em> the
default initial value by overriding the <tt>:initform</tt>, and can 
<em>add to</em> the initargs and accessors.

<p>However, the union for <tt>:accessor</tt> is just a consequence
of how generic functions work.  If they can apply to instances of a
class C, they can also apply to instances of subclasses of C.
(Accessor functions are generic.)

</p><p>Here are some subclasses of <tt>person</tt>.  <tt>Teacher</tt> is
a direct subclass of <tt>person</tt>; <tt>maths-teacher</tt> is a 
direct subclass of <tt>teacher</tt> and an indirect subclass of 
<tt>person</tt> (via <tt>teacher</tt>).

</p><pre>cl&gt; (defclass teacher (person)
       ((subject :accessor teacher-subject
		 :initarg :subject)))
#&lt;clos:standard-class teacher @ #x7cf796&gt; 

cl&gt; (defclass maths-teacher (teacher)
       ((subject :initform "Mathematics")))
#&lt;clos:standard-class maths-teacher @ #x7d94be&gt; 

cl&gt; (setq p2 (make-instance 'maths-teacher
		 :name 'john
		 :age 34))
#&lt;maths-teacher @ #x7dcc66&gt; 

cl&gt; (describe p2)
#&lt;maths-teacher @ #x7dcc66&gt; is an instance of
     class #&lt;clos:standard-class maths-teacher @ #x7d94be&gt;:
 The following slots have :INSTANCE allocation:
 age        34
 name       john
 subject    "Mathematics"
</pre>

Note that classes print like 
<tt>#&lt;clos:standard-class maths-teacher @ #x7d94be&gt;</tt>.
The <tt>#&lt;...&gt;</tt> notation usually has the form

<pre>   #&lt;class-of-the-object ... more information ...&gt;
</pre>

So an instance of maths-teacher prints as <tt>#&lt;maths-teacher ...&gt;</tt>.
The notation for the classes above indicates that the classes are instances
of the class <tt>standard-class</tt>.  <tt>Defclass</tt> defines standard
classes; <tt>defstruct</tt> defines structure classes.

<p>Since classes are objects, they are too are instances of classes.
A class, such as <tt>standard-class</tt>, that has classes as its
instances is called a <em>metaclass</em>.

</p><h2><a name="m-inherit">Multiple inheritance</a></h2>

First, some terminology.  When defining a class C using <tt>defclass</tt>,
the superclasses listed in the definition of C are the <em>direct
superclasses</em> of C.  We can also consider the superclasses of
the direct superclasses, the superclasses of those superclasses,
and so on.  These are the <em>indirect superclasses</em> of C.
So in the examples above <tt>teacher</tt> is a direct superclass
of <tt>math…</tt></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2005, Julie and Colin Angus set out to row across the Atlantic Ocean in a seven-metre boat, built from quarter-inch marine-grade plywood wrapped with a composite of epoxy and fibreglass. It sounds like an eggshell in a tropical storm, but the boat was built to last, and so was the adventurous couple who took turns on the oars for five months during the crossing from Lisbon, Portugal, to Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast. Along the way, Julie became the first woman to paddle trans-Atlantic from mainland to mainland.<br></p><p>The days were long, at times rolling on wind-driven waves that could reach as high as a two-storey building, and at other times drifting on flat calm seas beneath the unrelenting sun. It gave them plenty of time to get up close with the ocean’s inhabitants, and also to ponder the challenges of monitoring the farthest reaches of the world where human eyes rarely look but are nevertheless well within the range of anthropogenic environmental damage.</p><p>“That’s really when the idea for Open Ocean Robotics started to form,” Angus says of the adventure that spawned her 2008 memoir, <em>Rowboat in a Hurricane</em>, and 10 years later the Victoria-based company she co-founded with Colin, her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The company designs and builds autonomous boats powered by the wind and sun. The crewless vessels can be loaded with sensors and cameras for monitoring and harnessing an array of data, from ocean currents, waves, and water temperature to marine mammal vocalizations, illegal fishing, and oil spills.&nbsp;</p><p>Angus hopes Open Ocean Robotics technology will be a game-changer in the world of ocean research and monitoring: their boats, able to transit the seas uninterrupted for six months or more at a stretch, could gather data from the remotest reaches of the world’s oceans, which have so far been logistically difficult and expensive to study. What’s more, they will be much cheaper and more environmentally friendly to operate than conventional crewed, fossil fuel-powered research boats.<br></p><p>These are busy times for Open Ocean Robotics, which is based at the Vancouver Island Technology Park several kilometres from the tideline. Angel investment, government grants, and a trickle of revenues have sustained the company so far, as it refines its technology and searches for that elusive home-run market.<br></p><p>The Victoria startup could be one of the bright lights in an ecosystem of businesses and organizations that the South Island Prosperity Partnership (SIPP)—in partnership with the City of Victoria and the Association of BC Marine Industries—hopes to mould into a cluster of ocean innovation and enterprise on Victoria’s Inner Harbour worthy of the world stage that has been dubbed COAST—the Centre for Ocean Applied Sustainable Technologies&nbsp;<br></p><p>If this seed comes to fruition, in 10 years’ time there will be dozens of new ocean-based companies clustered around co-working spaces and shared technology-testing facilities. Innovators and entrepreneurs might be swapping ideas over mid-morning espressos, and in the afternoon talking investment and business growth with venture fund managers who love ocean tech. And, being located in Victoria, there will probably be a yoga studio, health food café, and espresso bar.&nbsp;<br></p><p>According to Angus, despite its oceanside setting, having a university with globally recognized oceanography expertise, and a wealth of ocean tech companies, Victoria has never thought of itself as a true maritime city.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Even though Open Ocean Robotics is local, we’re a global company and we need a hub to help build connections and grow,” Angus told Capital Daily at the end of day packed with virtual meetings. “We could really benefit from partnerships with other smaller companies, especially when you’re introducing new technology like we are, and also with larger companies that can drive innovation and help us reach markets that would be hard to do individually.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If the dream seems clear, the means of getting there will require the same sort of perseverance and pluck that have calloused the hands of these two athletes on their numerous human-powered adventures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>From napkin to network<br></h3><p>What started as a SIPP working group discussion on the back of a napkin early in 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic sent the economy into hibernation, has become one of the organization’s flagship projects, according to Emilie de Rosenroll, CEO of the prosperity partnership.&nbsp;</p><p>BC’s diverse ocean sector includes transportation giants like Seaspan and global marine and aviation engineering specialist Babcock Canada. Aside from Open Ocean Robotics, there are more than 100 firms in the ocean science and technology space, like Jasco Applied Sciences, a specialist in acoustic marine monitoring and other ocean impact assessment work, microplastics monitoring startup Ocean Diagnostics, and Nanaimo’s Seamor Marine whose remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) are deployed worldwide for underwater pipe inspection, filming, and other applications. <br></p><p>Victoria is also a world leader in ocean data collection. Ocean Networks Canada, based on the UVic campus, gathers real-time data from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. It manages both NEPTUNE (the North East Pacific Time-series Underwater Networked Experiments) observatory—an 840-kilometre-long fibre optic network linking five seafloor stations loaded with sensors for measuring changes in salinity, nutrients, and other ocean properties—and its cousin, VENUS (Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea), in the Strait of Georgia.<br></p><p>Together, these businesses and organizations directly employ 22,000 workers, sustain another 33,000 jobs, and, in 2019, generated almost $7 billion in economic output. Despite these impressive stats, de Rosenroll thinks the sector is punching below its weight in the global ring. COAST wants to bring businesses together and create a thriving investment and startup ecosystem that will enable the West Coast to take a bigger slice of the global ocean economy, which is expected to grow in value to $3.8 trillion annually by 2030.<br></p><p>Like Julie Angus, who literally sees an ocean of research opportunities for Open Ocean Robotics’ autonomous boat technology, de Rosenroll believes there’s plenty of room to grow BC’s ocean sector by positioning COAST as a world leader in the “blue economy,” a loose term describing the sustainable, conservation-based use of the ocean and its resources.&nbsp;</p><p>“Sustainability is our strength,” de Rosenroll told Capital Daily, “Right now, Canada’s ocean economy is worth $36 billion. There’s no reason we can’t be bigger. What we’ve been missing on the West Coast is the aspiration.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To help get from aspiration to inspiration, Canada is looking to another ocean-facing nation: Norway.<br></p><p>Here’s the challenge: Norway, a country with a population roughly the size of BC, took decades to build a globally recognized ocean economy. That’s now worth an estimated $110 billion, 70% of which is generated by offshore oil and gas. De Rosenroll says Victoria wants to get there much faster, and it won’t have a lucrative fossil fuel industry to lean on.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Right now, COAST has an ocean to cross before it matches Norway’s success; in fact, it’s not much<strong> </strong>more than an idea with a volunteer CEO, Craig Norris, who is juggling the interim position with a full-time job as CEO of the Victoria International Marina. Besides a $100,000 Western Economic Diversification Grant and $20,000 from the City of Victoria to pay consultants to build a business case, neither industry nor the province or feds have made funding commitments. And although COAST hopes to have a physical address at Victoria’s equally aspirational Arts and Innovation District on vacant Rock Bay industrial land, no property has been secured.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The business case, completed in December, sets an ambitious target of creating 1,000 high-value jobs and 50 new companies by 2030. The plan also lays out a roadmap of staged financing to reach that target, starting with an initial $5 million for a co-working space, small venture fund, and startup incubator, leading up to a hoped-for future $160-million investment from government and industry for an ocean tech district on the South Island with more than 100 companies, shared testing facilities and workspaces, accelerator programs, and two venture funds managing $250 million in assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>“The goal is to enable innovation and collaboration that is hard or impossible to do without a hub like this,” de Rosenroll says.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/603709c45e99f71ef1ab09c5_DSC_4803.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>BC is home to a growing shipping industry. Photo:&nbsp;James MacDonald / Capital Daily</figcaption></figure><h3>‍<br>The Norwegian model<br></h3><p>Alex Rueben, executive director of the BC marine industries association, often thinks about the barriers facing the sector in between Zoom meetings with members from his office in Sidney.&nbsp;</p><p>Diversity and depth of expertise are not the problem; growth and collaboration are. Reuben says 95% of his association’s members are small- and medium-sized enterprises with less than 10 employees, including one- and two-person startups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It's the common curse of the startup founder: one person wearing many hats, courting investment while juggling R&amp;D, marketing, and day-to-day operations, sometimes to the detriment of all.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s no shortage of BC companies in ocean technology, but at the early stage these companies lack guidance, mentorship, and funding,” Rueben told Capital Daily in a phone interview. “We need a focal point that helps startups take technology from idea to commercialization.”<br></p><p>The template already exists in Atlantic Canada. The Centre for Ocean Ventures and Entrepreneurship (COVE) on the Halifax Harbour is a hub of innovation in marine tourism, energy, transportation, fisheries, and aquaculture, with 54 member companies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Across Cabot Strait from Nova Scotia, the St. John’s, NL-based Ocean Supercluster is focused on innovation in the extractive ocean industries, such as offshore oil and gas, fisheries, aquaculture, as well as the shipping industry.

<h2 id="step-2-install-the-cli">Step 2: Install the CLI</h2>
<p>Follow the instruction to <a href="https://app.soluble.cloud/cli">install the CLI</a> in the sidebar.</p>
<p>There are more <a href="https://docs.soluble.cloud/cli">detailed insructions</a> available in the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-run-your-first-assessment">Step 3: Run your first assessment</h2>
<p>Enter a directory containing terraform, CloudFormation or Kubernetes manifests and run one of the following:</p>
<pre><code># Terraform
$ soluble tf-scan

# CloudFormation
$ soluble cfn-scan

# Kubernetes
$ soluble k8s-scan

At present the scanners that are available for use are:

For Terraform:

* checkov - `soluble tf-scan checkov`
* tfsec - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`
* terrascan - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`

For CloudFormation:

* cfn-nag - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-nag`
* cfn-python-lint - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-python-lint`
* checkov - `soluble cfn-scan checkov`

For Kubernetes:

* checkov - `soluble k8s-scan checkov`

_Note: If you are interested in seeing other assessment tools, let us know at support@soluble.ai_


To send the results to Soluble Fusion, add the `--upload` flag.  For instance:

</code></pre>
<p>$ soluble tf-scan --upload
...</p>
<pre><code>
The output will include a link to the assessment results.

### Notes

For tools that depend on a language runtime and installation (i.e. checkov, cfn-lint need python runtime) we use a containerized distribution by default. 

If you don't have docker available or prefer to use the already-installed version of the assesment tool, you can add `--tool-path &lt;executable&gt;`.

So to use the locally installed version of checkov:

</code></pre>

<p>soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path checkov</p>

<p>soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path /usr/local/bin/checkov

I <a href="https://boxoutsports.com/">joined</a> Box Out Sports. <a href="https://orderedlist.com/">Steve</a> and I &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jnunemaker/status/1331644788232368132?s=20">launched</a> Speaker Deck Pro. It has been a busy two years!</p><p>And I'd be remiss not to mention the biggest change of all – the pandemic.</p><p>All of these things led to Flipper Cloud getting pushed to the side. I mean, it was running and working great. </p><p>We used it on both Box Out and Speaker Deck. But no one else could. Well, save the lucky few who guessed the magic word. Haha!</p><p>Following the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pro">release</a> of Speaker Deck <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pro">Pro</a>, Steve and I <strong>knew it was Flipper's turn</strong>. Seeing people give us their hard earned money for Speaker Deck was inspiring. Having a fully functional product for 2 years that no one can pay for is stupid.</p><p>But launching a product is <strong>no easy thing</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-first-hurdle-billing">The First Hurdle: Billing </h2><p>The first thing preventing Flipper from launching was a billing system. Turns out if people can't pay you, you don't make any money. </p><p>Thankfully, Stripe makes that really easy these days – especially with their new-ish <a href="https://stripe.com/billing">billing portal</a>. </p><p>Steve completely rewrote the Box Out billing system in May 2020. And he was fresh off integrating Speaker Deck with Stripe in December 2020. So we were confident we could have something solid in place in a few days.</p><p>Before you can bill though, <strong>you must price</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-second-hurdle-pricing">The Second Hurdle: Pricing</h2><p>More difficult than naming is pricing. Steve and I have always preferred simple pricing. </p><ul><li>Whole numbers like $30 instead of $29.99. </li><li>A few tiers of no-nonsense pricing and you can 🍌 out.</li><li>Limits for tiers based on a value metric. </li><li>General disdain for per seat pricing.</li></ul><p>Simple tiers worked for <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/01/06/live-from-harmony/">Harmony</a>. They worked for <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2011/02/20/give-yourself-constraints/">Gauges</a>. They are currently working for Box Out and Speaker Deck.</p><h3 id="tiers-and-a-value-metric">Tiers and a value metric</h3><p>We started with this tiered pricing model for Flipper. But the first question was what is the value metric? </p><p>We didn't want to limit <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs#projects">projects</a>, <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs#environments">environments</a> or <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs#features">features</a> in anyway, as doing so could encourage awkward use of the product (like using one project for all your projects). We want the product to always feel smooth.</p><p>Additionally, we've noticed the more developers you have using feature flags, the more valuable they become. Ding! We saw this during our time at GitHub. Value metric chosen – number of developers.</p><p>So we started with 3 plans based on the number of developers (value metric):</p><ul><li>$50 - 2 developers</li><li>$200 - 10 developers</li><li>$400 - 20 developers</li></ul><h3 id="but-it-didn-t-feel-right">But it didn't feel right</h3><p>The problem with this was $0 (open source) to $50 is a big leap. So was $50 to $200 and $200 to $400 for that matter. </p><p>For the same reasons we didn't want to limit features or projects, we didn't want customers to avoid adding a developer because it would tip them into a much larger plan. </p><ul><li>Our goal isn't to become a 🦄. Been there, done that.</li><li>Our goal isn't to squeeze as much 💰 as we can from our customers. </li><li>Our goal is <strong>to provide value to customers</strong> that makes it <strong>worth it for them</strong> to pay us and <strong>worth it for us</strong> to do so. That's it.</li></ul><h3 id="per-seat-really">Per seat... really?</h3><p>We brainstormed for a while and decided per seat pricing actually makes a lot of sense for Flipper. Shocking. I never thought I'd read those words written from my weak little programmer fingers 👐.</p><p>The value metric is number of developers. More developers for the customer is likely tied very closely to more revenue or funding. As the customer grows, we grow with them. If they shrink, the value they get from us and the cost to them does as well. </p><p><strong>It just made sense</strong>.</p><ul><li> Per seat pricing <strong>avoids the big jumps</strong> from tier to tier.</li><li> Per seat pricing <strong>ties the value to the cost</strong> for the customer.</li></ul><h3 id="market-research">Market Research </h3><p>Now the question was, how much per seat? We looked around at the market – <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">Launch Darkly</a>, <a href="https://split.io/">Split</a>, <a href="https://rollout.io/">Rollout</a>, <a href="https://configcat.com/">Configcat</a>, <a href="https://prefab.cloud/">Prefab</a>, <a href="https://ajustee.com/">Ajustee</a>, <a href="https://unleash-hosted.com/">Unleash</a> and <a href="https://switchover.io/">Switchover</a> to name a few.</p><p>The common theme was <strong>$10 - $90 per seat</strong>. The products on the higher end of that range were typically also tied to MAU (monthly active users aka actors in Flipper's terms). </p><p>Tying to MAU makes a lot of sense as well. If you have more actors that you are checking flags for, you likely are receiving more value by using flags. We don't currently track MAU's and thus don't provide any analytics (aka value) on that data. </p><p>We only charge for the value we provide. Since we don't provide analytics yet, there was no reason to try to price in the upper range. </p><p>Additionally, we want <strong>using</strong> Flipper Cloud to <strong>be a no brainer</strong>, especially for those <strong>already using open source Flipper</strong>.</p><p>We oscillated between $10 to $30 per seat and finally just split the difference – <strong>$20 per seat</strong>. I'm pretty happy with where we ended up. </p><figure><img src="https://www.johnnunemaker.com/content/images/2021/02/pricing.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.johnnunemaker.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/pricing.png 600w, https://www.johnnunemaker.com/content/images/2021/02/pricing.png 923w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But no one will buy, if they don't <strong>trust</strong> <strong>you</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-third-hurdle-trust">The Third Hurdle: Trust</h2><p>In talking with people about Flipper Cloud, the first thing that always came up was: ...<strong>but what happens if you are down</strong>, will my app be down?</p><p>This is a great problem! Its not a you don't provide any value problem. Or a you are too expensive problem. </p><p>This is an <strong>I want to use Flipper Cloud, </strong>but I want to know<strong> it won't hurt me</strong> problem. Making software not hurt you is a specialty of ours.</p><p>Before I answer the <em>what happens if you are down question</em>, let's dive into some background.</p><h3 id="one-feature-check-one-api-request">One Feature Check, One API Request</h3><p>The very first way that the <code>Flipper::Cloud</code> client <em>could</em> work is every time a feature check happens, it makes a request to the Flipper Cloud API to say "hey is this feature enabled for this actor?". </p><ul><li>If we were unavailable, your app would be unavailable. </li><li>If we were available and you were doing more than a single feature check, your app would be slow. Real slow.</li></ul><p>Nope. No way that would ever work. I worked on GitHub.com, one of the most trafficked sites in the world, for nearly 7 years. </p><p>The majority of my time at GitHub was focused on availability and resiliency. I would never ship something like the aforementioned to the world. That is just asking to tick customers off.</p><h3 id="one-request-in-your-app-one-api-request">One Request in Your App, One API Request</h3><p>The great thing about (open source) Flipper is that it is designed to be as performant as you need. It can <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2016/12/08/flipper-preloading/">preload all the data</a> required to check a feature for any actor, typically in one or two network calls.</p><p>With <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/f398a745b320ef081d9618b58006d6dfb4b7dde6/docs/Optimization.md#memoizing-middleware">a single middleware</a> addition, Flipper can preload all feature data for a request/job in your application. This means you can say "hey is this feature enabled for this actor?" as many times as you want on the page and no additional API requests will be issued. </p><ul><li>If we were unavailable, your app would be unavailable.</li><li>If we were available, no matter how fast your application was, it would always have a base response time of however long it takes for your app to request feature data from our API.</li></ul><p>Nope. No way. This would make a 1 to 1 correlation between your traffic and our API traffic. I'm never a fan of tying things together like that. </p><p>My goal is always <strong>to</strong> <strong>make things as constant as possible regardless of throughput</strong>. </p><h3 id="one-api-request-per-n-seconds-per-thread-or-process-">One API Request per N seconds per thread (or process)</h3><p>The next step up in efficiency was to move the request on every page load to one request every N seconds per process per thread. This is far from ideal, but <strong>we actually used it</strong> on Box Out and Speaker Deck for more than a year.</p><p>Flipper is built on adapters. And the adapters are very composable/layerable. </p><p>At <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, we used a MySQL adapter, wrapped by a Memcached adapter. This meant all reads first went to memcached and then only to mysql if the cache wasn't populated.</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> does something similar. Their <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/22dc7bdafcf442b96ace849341fb87bca7160614/lib/feature.rb#L164-181">Flipper instance</a> caches in memory, falling back to redis which falls back to Active Record.</p><p>This adapter layering is also how the per request memoization I talked about before works. I created a <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/f398a745b320ef081d9618b58006d6dfb4b7dde6/lib/flipper/adapters/memoizable.rb">memoizing adapter</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/f398a745b320ef081d9618b58006d6dfb4b7dde6/lib/flipper/middleware/memoizer.rb">middleware</a> that ticks it <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/f398a745b320ef081d9618b58006d6dfb4b7dde6/lib/flipper/middleware/memoizer.rb#L54">on</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/f398a745b320ef081d9618b58006d6dfb4b7dde6/lib/flipper/middleware/memoizer.rb#L64">off</a> per request. Anytime you use <code>Flipper.new(adapter)</code>, I <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/f398a745b320ef081d9618b58006d6dfb4b7dde6/lib/flipper/dsl.rb#L20-L23">wrap the adapter you provide</a> with the memoized adapter, so you don't have to.</p><p>Knowing how adapters work in Flipper (I mean I wrote them right? 😆), I created a <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/v0.13.0/lib/flipper/adapters/sync.rb">sync adapter</a> that worked with a local and a remote. It defaulted to <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/v0.13.0/lib/flipper/adapters/sync.rb#L34">synchronizing on an interval</a> to keep the local in sync with the remote.</p><p>This moved <code>Flipper::Cloud</code> from making API requests on every request in your app to one API request every N seconds per process/thread in your app. More processes in your app meant more time in your requests talking to our API. </p><ul><li>If we were unavailable, you only experienced slower requests every N seconds per process. We also stored the data in your app, so feature check reads still worked. </li><li>If we were available, you'd see one request to Flipper per process per thread (if using threads). </li></ul><p>Much improved. Still, anyone who has worked on a high throughput app knows that this isn't a good idea long term. </p><h3 id="one-api-request-per-n-seconds">One API request per N seconds</h3><p>The next improvement was a rake task. Ugh. Yuck. But it worked great! I moved Box Out to use the ActiveRecord adapter in production and added a rake task to sync every N seconds. </p><p>The rake task configured flipper to use <code>Flipper::Cloud</code> with the same Active Record adapter. Every N seconds the rake task would run, Cloud would realize it had not synced and would do so. </p><ul><li>If we were available, your app would just make one request every N seconds.</li><li>If we were unavailable, your app would remain available as all reads go to the local to your app adapter of your choosing (Active Record, Redis, Mongo, whatever).</li></ul><p>This solved the performance problem of making requests to the Flipper Cloud API in your app's request lifecycle. But there were a couple of downsides:</p><ul><li>You needed a separate process to perform the syncing.</li><li>You had to wait for feature changes as syncing only happened every N seconds.</li></ul><h3 id="from-pull-to-push">From Pull to Push</h3><p>I knew we needed to move from pull (all of the aforementioned stuff) to push in a way that isolates your availability from ours. </p><p>My goals were:</p><ul><li>fast enough sync that it <em>feels</em> instant (aka &lt; a few seconds).</li><li>no separate process for you to run.</li><li>minimal impact to performance.</li></ul><p>At some point, it occurred to me that webhooks could likely meet all of those goals. </p><ul><li><strong>Webhooks…</strong></li></ul></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<p>NASA offers a data product called a Vegetation Index. This can be used to track how green the Earth is.</p>







<p>Although many are familiar with recent global greening, I prefer to always check the source data. And so I downloaded all of their available 16-day-increment data from 2000 to 2021. Here’s my result:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1420" data-permalink="https://phzoe.com/veg/" data-orig-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png" data-orig-size="740,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="veg" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=740" src="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=740" alt="" srcset="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png 740w, https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=150 150w, https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"></figure></div>



<pre><code>0.0936 --&gt; 0.1029 is +9.94%</code></pre>



<p>10% global greening in 20 years! We are incredibly fortunate!</p>



<p>I just wish everyone felt that way. But you know not everyone does. To the extent that humans enhance global greening is precisely what social parasites want to tax and regulate. No good deed goes unpunished.</p>



<p>Anyway, Enjoy 🙂 -Zoe</p>



<p>P. S. The Earth is ~29% land. A Veg Index of ~0.29 would mean all covered land is heavy vegetation. </p>

					<p>It was in 2016 when the trike design has developed its first shapes and got a wider recognition. Artūras Mikalauskas – the founder – found a design student –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/43993905/AKO-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Lukas Avėnas</i></a> – who was crazy enough to jump on such a venture. With the mentorship &amp; ideology suggestions from Artūras, they have successfully created the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://lukasavenas.com/ako-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKO Trike concept design</a></em>. Later that year, Lukas won the Young Designers Award for his design. Since then, Artūras initiated the build of a first concept-proof prototype.</p>

<p><span>It’s one thing for a few individuals to automate a few test cases and run them at scheduled intervals. It’s quite another for an agile team to run hundreds of tests in the continuous integration (CI) server at development milestones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To move from the former to the latter, quality assurance leaders need tools to help them scale testing operations to effectively manage the difficulty of growing tools, people, and processes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Testim Announces TestOps</span></h2>
<p><span>TestOps is a set of capabilities designed to help managers and quality-oriented development teams efficiently and effectively scale their automation initiatives. TestOps helps users establish and maintain control, improve organization and management, and gain insights to unjumble the growing complexity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Control&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Leaders of quality initiatives should set guiding principles to optimize test architecture and component reuse to minimize maintenance. They should establish policies and controls to ensure their tests meet the same high standards as their code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Features:&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Branching with conflict resolution (improved) – </b><span>Synchronize your test branches with your application code, see diffs, resolve conflicts, and cherrypick what to merge. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/merging-branches"><span>Docs</span></a><b></b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Read-only master branch (new) – </b><span>Protect the test master branch from unauthorized changes. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/read-only"><span>Docs</span></a><b></b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Pull requests with approvers (new) – </b><span>Users can create tests and submit changes as pull requests to be reviewed by SMEs. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/pull-requests"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><b><i>The Read-Only master helps us prevent slip-ups, and it makes us much more vigilant of any changes we make. Having the PRs within testim makes sure that we don’t forget to merge a branch after merging the git side.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>– </i></b><span>Savanna Goodman, QA Automation Engineer at IntSights</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span>Management</span></h2>
<p><span>As you grow your application and your team, your test suites also swell. A robust classification system can help users find the tests they need faster, reduce switching costs, and improving productivity. Management includes understanding which tests are trusted and CI-ready and which are temperamental and cause unnecessary heartburn. Management at scale should also consist of tools to help balance workload and prevent overlap.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Features:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Test library (new)</b><span> – In addition to suites and labels, leaders can organize tests in folders by user type, feature, and more—improving coordination. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/test-list"><span>Docs</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Shared step library (new)</b><span> – Reusable, shared steps, and groups have a new library, providing quick access in the visual editor to facilitate reuse and improve test architecture. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/shared-steps-library"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Test Status (new)</b><span> – Set status on tests to alter treatment in the CI server, for instance, quarantine flaky tests from failing builds. It helps build trust that tests are accurate when they run in the CI. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/test-status"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Test Owner (new)</b><span> – Assign test ownership to yourself or a team member to prevent duplication of effort, distribute workload, or show responsibility. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/test-owner"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><b><i>We use a test status of “draft” to indicate tests are a work in progress or awaiting peer review. We can now quickly identify where we need to focus our attention.</i></b></p>
<p><i><span>– Erin Hess, Software Quality Lead, Duzy</span></i></p></blockquote>
<h2><span>Insights</span></h2>
<p><span>To grow your test automation project in the right direction, you need insights from your testing data. You’ll need to understand the current state and trend of quality and use data to inform team progress or process improvement areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Features:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Failure trends (existing)</b><span> – Identify troublesome tests and recurring failure types and trends over time to guide process improvement measures. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/tag-remote-runs-failures#suggested-failure-tags"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Duplication levels (new)</b><span> – Understand where test steps are duplicated across tests, refactor them, and replace them with manageable shared groups that reduce ongoing maintenance. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/auto-grouping2"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Management reports enhancements (coming soon)</b><span> – Create and send custom reports to management to demonstrate team and quality status and progress towards goals. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/managerial-reports"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Modern agile development teams comprise software engineers, quality engineers, devops engineers, and product owners. For many of them, quality is a teamwide responsibility. Yet, tools to manage quality processes efficiently are mostly absent. The TestOps capabilities announced today help fill that gap. They enable teams to scale their testing operations efficiently—with control, management, and insights. This announcement is just the start, as we plan to expand our TestOps capabilities and help more customers build quality software faster.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.testim.io/testops"><span>Read more</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>While Elon Musk was updating about the Starlink internet speed increase via a tweet last evening, a follower presented the idea of a mini portable Starlink dish, and Musk affirmed that it is a good idea.</p>



<p>SpaceX is currently working on system upgrades that might result in higher Starlink internet speeds at times. In response to a question about when Starlink will be available in the Bay Area, “Probably mid-year (2021), but Starlink is really meant for those who are least served. Bay usually has great Internet,” SpaceX CEO <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> said.</p>



<p>The idea of an even more compact, probably sub-1ft diameter dish is praised by Elon Musk, and looking at his past record, he might actually make this happen. A smaller dish that is easier to carry during remote excursions with chargeable batteries could be a perfect travel companion.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> going to production later this year, many Starlink customers who will own the Cybertruck will want to take the mini dish with them on their journeys. Since the Cybertruck will have power outlets and a huge battery pack inside, powering a small Starlink dish for long periods of time will not be an issue for this electric pickup truck.</p>



<p>We asked a recent <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> beta customer about how much internet speeds he is getting with his new dish installed on the roof of his home. Brian is getting from min 40 Mbps to max 177 Mbps with Starlink depending on the hour of the day or night. He is getting an average speed of 81 Mbps, not so bad. The silver lining is that with time, the speeds are only going to get better and better.</p>

<p>For internet users on Gbps rated connections, this speed might look slow but there is a large number of users even in the developed world who have a 1 – 5 Mbps connection at home. For example, Christ T.

<p>Square made $3.16 billion revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 — and Bitcoin flowing through its Cash App generated more than half.</p>

<p>Excluding Bitcoin revenues, Square generated $1.4 billion last quarter — up 23% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Alongside its earnings, Square disclosed it recently bought 3,318 BTC for $170 million (an average price of about $51,000 per BTC).</p>

										                <p><em>Alexandra Elbakyan at a talk in 2010. Photo: Apneet Jolly/Flickr, CC BY 2.0.</em></p>
<p>On December 24, 2020, the Delhi high court conducted its first hearing for the ongoing case against Alexandra Elbakyan’s website Sci-Hub, an online repository of academic literature that allows users free access to its contents.</p>
<p>It is not unknown that websites like Sci-Hub and Libgen (portmanteau of ‘Library Genesis’) are important for scholars and students alike in India who can’t afford individual subscriptions to academic journals.</p>


<p>However, academic publishers Elsevier Ltd., Wiley Pvt. Ltd. and the American Chemical Society sued Sci-Hub and Libgen for copyright infringement in India and asked for the country’s IT ministry to block access to these sites.</p>
<p>The court’s next hearing is scheduled for February 23. In an exclusive interview to <em>The Wire Science</em>, <strong>Alexandra Elbakyan</strong> spoke of her own days in college, where she said she first felt the need for a tool like Sci-Hub, the legal issues between Elsevier and Sci-Hub around the world, and the tension between piracy and sharing.</p>
<p><em>Excerpts from the interview are presented below, with a few minor edits for style.</em></p>
<p><strong>Could you tell me about your own college experience at Satbayev University, Kazakhstan, in the absence of portals like Sci-Hub? Were there specific difficulties you faced that led to the conception of Sci-Hub?</strong></p>
<p>I first stumbled upon academic paywalls when I was in my final year of study. I studied information technologies, and specialised in infosecurity. Since middle school I was interested in neuroscience, too, so I wanted to combine both fields in my final year project. I started to work on brain-machine interfaces and set up a task to develop a system that can use brainwaves as passwords, in the same way you can use your fingerprint to unlock a computer.</p>
<p>I started searching for information and that was when I first learned that academic journals exist at all. Today, there are people who use Sci-Hub while they study in school, but I was quite old when I started with research.</p>
<p>So, I located the articles that were interesting for my topic on websites such as IEEE or ScienceDirect and almost all of them were paywalled. I was not concerned. For a long time since school, I was using various technologies which made science movies, books and software freely available. So I was sure there was some website to download academic articles for free.</p>
<p>I googled and googled but found nothing! Then I was quite surprised and frustrated, but after a long search I found some forums such as passfans or myescience where people shared passwords to access university libraries. Using these passwords, I was able to enter universities that had subscriptions to these journals and download articles for free.</p>
<p>Then I got an idea to develop a software program that people can use to download academic articles automatically. The design I imagined then was quite different from Sci-Hub, but it was the same idea. I tried discussing it on forums but it did not cause a lot of interest, and I forgot about it for a while. I graduated from university and travelled abroad. I developed Sci-Hub two years later.</p>
<p><strong>Despite a series of lawsuits for copyright infringement, Sci-Hub is not widely thought of as a pirate, and has found acceptance among scholars. What would you say about this?</strong></p>
<p>Today, most scientists view the academic publishing system as fundamentally unjust and exploitative. The problem is that publishers are not actual creators of these works, scientists are – they do all the work, and academic publishers simply use their position of power in the Republic of Science to extract unjust profits. Sci-Hub does not enable piracy where creative people are deprived of the reward they deserve. It is a very different thing.</p>
<p>What does one mean by the word ‘piracy’? Only after several years was I able to comprehend how some people use this word in a bad sense. Most scientists do not care about the legal status at all. They want to do science, and they need to access academic literature to do it, and these legal things — they are in a different reality that scholars do not belong to at all, another planet or a different universe.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/science/how-scihub-is-at-the-forefront-of-the-quest-to-frame-scientific-knowledge-as-public-good/">How Sci-Hub Is at the Forefront of the Quest to Frame Scientific Knowledge as Public Good</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>How much do authors earn from the money paid to cross an academic publisher’s paywall?&nbsp;Can you talk about how publishers exercise their power?</strong></p>
<p>The careers of researchers depend on journal publications. To receive funding or secure positions at the university, a scientist must have publications in ‘high-impact’ academic journals. Most of these journals today belong to corporations like Elsevier, Wiley and Springer-Nature.</p>
<p>Researchers do the actual work: they invent the hypothesis, do the experiments and write the articles describing the results of these experiments. Then they publish this article in an academic journal. They cannot simply put this article online on their blog: to be recognised as research work, it must be published in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. So they send their articles to publishers like Elsevier, Wiley or Springer.</p>
<p>Publishers send articles they have received to other scientists for peer-review. Reviewers give their opinion on whether the work should be accepted in a journal or not, or if some additional work must be done. Based on these reviews, the article is published or rejected.</p>
<p>Both reviewers and scientists work for free. They do not earn any compensation from the academic publisher. Here, academic publishers work as organisers of the academic community, but not as creators. The work of the academic publisher is organisational and not creative.</p>
<p><strong>And yet, Elsevier Ltd. has sued Sci-Hub in the US, Sweden, Belgium and France, lobbied for a block in Russia, and now it has filed a lawsuit in India. It’s often the same group of publishers that takes action against Sci-Hub: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, the American Chemical Society. Why do you think it is this group?</strong></p>
<p>Because most academic works and the most popular works in Sci-Hub’s database are from these publishers, and Elsevier is the leading one in numbers. These companies form an oligopoly that currently controls all academic communication. These publishers alone perhaps control the majority of science. They are key players.</p>
<p>Sci-Hub’s view is that science should not be controlled by a few big companies but it should be a dynamic network of learned societies.</p>
<p><strong>In the last hearing on January 6, 2021, the Delhi High Court deemed the case to be of public importance, and allowed scholars to register their concerns with the court. You claimed many Twitter users were tweeting at the Sci-Hub account and you were archiving these tweets. But on January 8, Twitter suspended Sci-Hub’s account. Can you tell me the extent to which Twitter’s move affected your ability to defend your case?</strong></p>
<p>On Sci-Hub’s Twitter account, anyone could see right away that no researcher today supports what publishers do and everyone thinks that academic research should be free to access. It was very obvious and visible on the Sci-Hub account, and people who wanted to support Sci-Hub had a place to do it.</p>
<p>Now of course after the Sci-Hub account has been banned there are fewer people voicing their opinions about Sci-Hub, because the discussion platform is gone, so there are fewer supportive comments, and the support of Sci-Hub is not as obvious as it has previously been. However, in my view it will not seriously affect the ability to defend the current case in India.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/sci-hub-case-india-academic-publishing-access-alexandra-elbakyan-twitter-account-suspension/">Curious Timing: As Sci-Hub Case Takes off in India, Twitter Suspends Its Account</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>The number of cases against you have shot up in the last five years. Would you be comfortable about sharing how this has affected you as an individual?</strong></p>
<p>Researchers depend on Sci-Hub and I feel a need to support its users, I cannot simply abandon them. I love academic literature and knowledge, and I love working on Sci-Hub. Sci-Hub is nine years old already and it has become a fundamental part of my life. I never thought about abandoning Sci-Hub actually. I have a dream to make academic literature free and I work on it consistently.</p>
<p>Currently the lawsuits have not targeted or affected me directly. I was ordered to pay Elsevier 15 million dollars in damages but I am able to ignore a United States order right now. But what might happen in the future?</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to those who argue that it is naïve to expect a system of unhindered exchange of information to thrive, and that publishing houses have a right over the knowledge that they publish?</strong></p>
<p>What is naive and dangerous is to expect science to thrive when information exchange is hindered. And as I said before, science should not be controlled by a few big corporations. That is detrimental to science.</p>

		<p>Our mission is to give everyone in the world <strong>computer superpowers</strong>. We build powerful yet approachable tools &amp; platforms for developers, students, and educators.</p>
<p>We see a new generation of hackers and entrepreneurs rising to seize the power of computers and the internet to create software that empowers them and their communities. They refuse to be programmed by the software priesthood that wants them to endlessly consume ads. Instead, they build a more free society where computers work for and under human users, not the other way around. The world we're describing is coming, and we exist to accelerate the shift. <a href="https://repl.it/careers">Join us</a>! </p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/replit.png" alt="art"></p>
<p>Replit is a multiplayer computing environment that makes it <a href="https://blog.replit.com/internet-of-fun">fun</a> to learn how to code, build, and <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">share apps</a> with other people. You can create a cloud-powered computer in milliseconds -- we call them "repls" -- and you can create as many of them as you'd like, all for free. Repls come with storage for your code and files, a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">database</a> for your data, and a <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">multiplayer editor</a> &amp; console to code with your friends. For <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">$7/month</a>, you'll get more powerful machines and, with one-click, make them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">run forever</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="db"></p>
<p>When you invite a friend to your repl, you can see them in your editor and talk to them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">right in your code</a>. You can make <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/http-servers">web</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/native-graphics-love">desktop</a>, and even command-line apps. Replit takes care of the entire process of <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">publishing and hosting apps</a> so you can focus on your ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Live-Code-Editing.gif?resize=800%2C450&amp;strip=all" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>When you've built something you want to share, you can share the <a href="https://blog.replit.com/spotlight">repl URL</a>, and your users can play with your app, react to it, comment on it, and even fork and remix it. Replit gives you a profile to keep and showcase all your apps and repls. You can make <a href="https://repl.it/site/teams">shared team profiles</a> for your class, friends, or company to collaborate on repls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/spotlight/ios-demo.gif" alt="share"></p>
<p>Because you can make a repl in milliseconds, Replit makes it fun and safe to experiment with ideas. Learning comes naturally as a side effect of playing in the Replit ecosystem.</p>
<p>Millions of people have learned how to code with Replit and built great apps with thousands of happy users. Some have even built businesses and become rich &amp; famous.</p>
<p>Replit's design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learnable yet scalable interfaces</strong>: Interfaces today present the same UI to vastly different users, from children to adults, from novices to experts. Our mission demands that we make computing environments more accessible to novices while making it possible to transition to more powerful interfaces. Replit starts with a simple editor and console, which gets learners very far. The UI, however, is adaptable and presents different faces to different users and use-cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure as legos</strong>: A core part of commanding computer power is to be able to build for the modern internet-connected world. Despite progress in cloud computing, infrastructure remains inaccessible to novices, hobbyists, and educators. We change this by designing simple and scalable components, like cloud-hosted servers accessible right from the repl, storage, databases, etc., that require little configuration and maintenance by the programmer. Coders can then mix and match components to create endless possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People-centric technology</strong>: It's more exciting and fun to create and learn with other people.

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/intro.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Introduction"></p>

<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack that allows JavaScript from one site to run on another. XSS is interesting not due to the technical difficulty of the attack but rather because it exploits some of the core security mechanisms of web browsers and because of its sheer pervasiveness. Understanding XSS and its mitigations provides substantial insight into how the web works and how sites are safely (and unsafely) isolated from each other.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Initially the web was a collection of static HTML documents that the browser would render for users to view. As the web grew, demands for richer documents grew, which led to the development of JavaScript and cookies: JavaScript to make documents interactive and cookies to allow browsers to save the state of a document.</p>

<p>The advent of these features led to browsers not only rendering HTML documents, but also providing an in-memory representation of the document called the Document Object Model (DOM) as an API to the document for developers. The DOM gave developers a tree-based representation of the HTML tags of a document and also access to cookies to retrieve the state of the document. As time went on, the DOM went from a largely read-only structure to a read-write structure where updating the DOM would lead to re-rendering of the document.</p>

<p>Once documents gained the ability to execute code, browsers needed to define the execution context for JavaScript programs. The policy that was developed is called the Same-Origin policy and is still one of the fundamental security primitives of browser security. Originally, the Same-Origin policy stated that JavaScript within one document can only access its own DOM and the DOMs of other documents with the same origin. Later when <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (and now <code>Fetch</code>) were added, a modified version of the same origin policy followed. These APIs could issue requests to any origin, they could only read the response to requests from the same origin.</p>

<p>What exactly is an origin? It’s the tuple of protocol, hostname, and port of a document.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">https://www.example.com:443/app
^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
Scheme  Host            Port</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 1: Scheme, host, and port of this url is the tuple that composes a browser origin.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/same-origin.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Same Origin Diagram"></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: An illustration of the Same-Origin in action. JavaScript running on www.evil.com is unable to access the DOM of www.example.com.</em></p>

<p>The Same-Origin policy has been great in mitigating attacks on static sites as illustrated in Figure (2). However, attacks on dynamically generated sites that accept user input have been quite difficult because the web allows mixing of code and data. Mixing code and data allows attacker-controlled input to execute within the origin of the document.</p>

<p>XSS attacks typically manifest themselves in three broad manners: reflected, stored, and DOM-based.</p>

<p>Reflected and stored XSS attacks are fundamentally the same, as they both rely on malicious input being sent to the backend server and the server (at some point) presenting that input to the user. Reflected XSS occurs immediately, usually in the form of a maliciously crafted link by the attacker that the victim then clicks. Stored XSS occurs when the attacker uploads malicious input that is later displayed to the user. DOM-based attacks are different in that they occur purely client-side and involve malicious input manipulating the DOM.</p>

<p>If you didn’t fully grasp the forms above, don’t worry, they’ll make more sense as we cover some examples below.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="reflected-xss-attacks">Reflected XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Below you can see a simple Go-based web application that “reflects” its input (even if it’s a malicious script) back to the user. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss1.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss1.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>handler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
    <span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)

    <span>messages</span>, <span>ok</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span>.<span>URL</span>.<span>Query</span>()[<span>"message"</span>]
    <span>if</span> !<span>ok</span> {
       <span>messages</span> = []<span>string</span>{<span>"hello, world"</span>}
    }
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>"&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;%v&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"</span>, <span>messages</span>[<span>0</span>])
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>handler</span>)
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 3: An example of a web application with a reflected XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see the XSS attack navigate to the vulnerable URL below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">http://localhost:8080?message<span>=</span>&lt;script&gt;alert<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Take a look at the source, and you’ll see the server returned a document that looks something like the one in Figure (4). Note how the mixing of code and data allowed this attack to occur.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>script</span>&gt;<span>alert</span>(<span>1</span>)&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 4: Example output of a web application vulnerable to XSS.</em></p>

<p>Admittedly, this may seem like a somewhat contrived example because XSS protection was explicitly disabled. However this form of XSS protection has always been heuristic-based with a variety of workarounds for different browsers. It was disabled to create simple cross-browser examples that illustrate the core concepts of XSS attacks. Furthermore, some browsers are removing these heuristic-based XSS protections, for <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5021976655560704">example if you are running Chrome 78 or above</a>, you don’t need to include the <code>w.Header().Set("X-XSS-Protection", "0")</code> line for this attack to work.</p>

<h3 id="stored-xss-attacks">Stored XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Stored XSS attacks are fundamentally similar to reflected attacks, the main difference being the attack payload comes from a datastore instead of directly from the input. For example, an attacker will upload the payload to the web application which will then be shown to every logged in user.</p>

<p>Below is a simple chat application written in Go that illustrates a stored XSS attack. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss2.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss2.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>

<span>var</span> <span>tmpl</span> = <span>`
</span><span>&lt;form action="/save"&gt;
</span><span>  Message: &lt;input name="message" type="text"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
</span><span>  &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/form&gt;
</span><span>%v
</span><span>`</span>

<span>func</span> <span>saveHandler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
	<span>mu</span>.<span>Lock</span>()
	<span>defer</span> <span>mu</span>.<span>Unlock</span>()

	<span>r</span>.<span>ParseForm</span>()
	<span>messages</span>, <span>ok</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span>.<span>Form</span>[<span>"message"</span>]
	<span>if</span> !<span>ok</span> {
		<span>http</span>.<span>Error</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>"missing message"</span>, <span>500</span>)
	}

	<span>db</span> = append(<span>db</span>, <span>messages</span>[<span>0</span>])

	<span>http</span>.<span>Redirect</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>r</span>, <span>"/"</span>, <span>301</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>viewHandler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
	<span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)
	<span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"Content-Type"</span>, <span>"text/html; charset=utf-8"</span>)

		<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;li&gt;"</span> <span>+</span> <span>message</span> <span>+</span> <span>"&lt;/li&gt;"</span>)
	}
	<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;/ul&gt;"</span>)

}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {

	<span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/save"</span>, <span>saveHandler</span>)
	<span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 5: An example of a web application with a stored XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see the XSS attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and type in the message <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The attack occurs in two phases. First, the attack payload is saved to the datastore in the <code>storeHandler</code> function. Next, when the page is rendered in <code>viewHandler</code>, the attack payload is directly added to the output.</p>

<p>Once again, the culprit is the allowing of mixing of data and code. The browser has no way to tell if the payload was intentional or malicious.</p>

<h3 id="dom-based-xss-attacks">DOM-Based XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>DOM-based XSS attacks don’t involve the backend and occur purely client-side. They’re also quite interesting because modern web applications are moving logic to the client. DOM- based XSS attacks occur when user input is allowed to directly manipulate the DOM in unsafe ways. The good news for attackers is that the DOM has a wide variety of ways it can be abused, the most popular being <code>innerHTML</code> and <code>document.write</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a web application that serves static content. It’s fundamentally the same as the reflected XSS example, but here the attack will occur entirely client- side. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss3.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss3.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
)

<span>const</span> <span>content</span> = <span>`
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;html&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;head&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;script&gt;
</span><span>          window.onload = function() {
</span><span>             var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
</span><span>             p = document.getElementById("content")
</span><span>             p.innerHTML = params.get("message")
</span><span>	     };
</span><span>       &lt;/script&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/head&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;body&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;p id="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/body&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/html&gt;
</span><span>`</span>

<span>func</span> <span>handler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
    <span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>content</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>handler</span>)
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 6: An example of a web application with a DOM-based XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see this attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(1);/&gt;"</code>. Note that the attack vector is slightly different, and the XSS sink <code>innerHTML</code> won’t execute a script directly; however, it will add HTML elements which will then execute JavaScript. In the example given, an image element is added that executes JavaScript when an error occurs. The error always occurs because the attacker conveniently always provides an invalid source.</p>

<p>If you want to directly add a script element, you’ll have to use a different XSS sink. As we mentioned, you’re in luck because the DOM provides a wide variety of dangerous sinks. Replace the script element in Figure (6) with the script element in Figure (7) and navigate to the following URL <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;"</code>. This attack works because <code>document.write</code> accepts script elements directly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
   <span>window</span>.<span>onload</span> = <span>function</span>() {
      <span>var</span> <span>params</span> = <span>new</span> <span>URLSearchParams</span>(<span>window</span>.<span>location</span>.<span>search</span>);
      <span>document</span>.<span>open</span>();
      <span>document</span>.<span>write</span>(<span>params</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"message"</span>));
      <span>document</span>.close();
   };
&lt;<span>/</span><span>script</span>&gt;

          <article>
            

<p>With Zeitwerk, you can streamline your programming knowing that classes and modules are available everywhere.</p>

<h2>What are Code Loaders?</h2>

<p>Code loaders let developers define <code>classes</code> and <code>modules</code> across different files and folders and use them throughout the codebase without explicitly requiring them. Rails is a good example of a piece of software that uses code loaders. Programming in Rails doesn't require explicit <code>require</code> calls to load models before using them in controllers. In fact, in Rails 6, everything in the <code>app</code> directory is auto-loaded on app boot, with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>While it is easy to think code loading is all about making calls to <code>require</code>, it isn't that simple. Code loading can be further broken down into three parts, as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Auto Loading:</strong> This means code is loaded on-the-fly as required. For example, in Rails, running <code>rails s</code> doesn't load all the models, controllers, etc. But, on the first hit of the model <code>User</code>, it runs the auto loading mechanism to find and use the model. This is auto loading in action. This has some advantages for our development environment, as we have faster app and <code>rails console</code> startup times. <code>Rails.config.autoload_path</code> controls the paths to be auto-loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Eager Loading:</strong> This means code is loaded into memory at app startup and doesn't wait for the constants to be called before requiring it. In Rails, code is eager loaded in production. From the explanation above, autoloading code in production will result in slow response times, as each constant will be required on-the-fly. <code>Rails.config.eager_load_paths</code> controls the paths to be eager loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Reloading:</strong> The code loader is constantly watching for changes to files in the <code>autoload_path</code> and reloads files when it notices any changes. In Rails, this can be quite useful in development, as it enables us to run <code>rails s</code> and simultaneously make changes without needing to restart the rails server. This is reloading in action.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can easily see that most of these concepts have been developed and live in Rails. Zeitwerk changes this! Zeitwerk enables us to bring all the code loading action to any Ruby project.</p>

<h2>What is Zeitwerk?</h2>

<p>Zeitwerk is an efficient and thread-safe code loader for Ruby and can be used in any Ruby project, including Web frameworks (Rails, Hanami, Sinatra), Cli tools, and gems. With it, you can streamline your programming knowing that classes and modules are available everywhere. Traditionally, Rails and <em>some</em> other gems have built-in code loaders to enable this functionality. However, Zeitwerk extracts these concepts into a gem and allows Rubyists to apply these concepts to their projects.</p>

<h3>Installing Zeitwerk</h3>

<p>First things first, we need to install the gem:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>gem</span> <span>install</span> <span>zeitwerk</span>

<span># OR in your Gemfile</span>
<span>gem</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span><span>,</span> <span>'~&gt; 2.4.0'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Configuring Zeitwerk</h3>

<p>So let's start with the basics:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>
<span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above code instantiates a loader instance and calls <code>setup</code>. After the call to <code>setup</code>, loaders are ready to load code. But, before that, all the necessary configurations on the <code>loader</code> should be covered already. In this article, I'll cover a few of the configurations on the <code>loader</code> and conventions for structuring your code.</p>

<ul>
<li>File Structure: For Zeitwerk to work, files and directory names need to match the modules and class names they define. For example,</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code>  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>         <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span>
  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>/</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>     <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span><span>::</span><span>Foo</span>
  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>/</span><span>bar_baz</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span><span>::</span><span>BarBaz</span>
  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>/</span><span>woo</span><span>/</span><span>zoo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span><span>::</span><span>Woo</span><span>::</span><span>Zoo</span>

<ul>
<li>Root Namespaces: Root Namespaces are directories where <code>Zeitwerk</code> can find your code. When <code>modules</code> and <code>classes</code> are referenced, Zeitwerk knows to search the root namespaces with the matching file name. For example,</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code>  <span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>
  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"app/models"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"app/controllers"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>//</span> <span>matches</span> <span>as</span> <span>follows</span>
  <span>app</span><span>/</span><span>models</span><span>/</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>                        <span>-&gt;</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>app</span><span>/</span><span>controllers</span><span>/</span><span>admin</span><span>/</span><span>users_controller</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Admin</span><span>::</span><span>UsersController</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are two primary ways to define the root namespace for two different use cases. The default way is shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code>  <span>//</span> <span>init</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>
  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>__dir__</span><span>}</span><span>/bar"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>

  <span>//</span> <span>bar</span><span>/</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>Foo</span><span>;</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means the class <code>Foo</code> can be referenced without an explicit <code>Bar::Foo</code>, as the bar directory acts as a root namespace. The second way to define a namespace is to explicitly state the namespace in the call to <code>push_dir</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>  <span>//</span> <span>init</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>

  <span>module</span> <span>Bar</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>__dir__</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>/</span><span>bar</span><span>,</span> <span>namespace: </span><span>Bar</span><span>)</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>

  <span>//</span> <span>src</span><span>/</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>Bar</span><span>::</span><span>Foo</span><span>;</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are a few things to note from in this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>The module <code>Bar</code> was already defined before being used by <code>push_dir</code> . If the module we want to use is defined by a third-party, then a simple require will define it before we use it in our call to <code>push_dir</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>push_dir</code> explicitly specifies the namespace <code>Bar</code>.</li>
<li>The file <code>src/foo.rb</code> defined <code>Bar::Foo</code>, not <code>Foo</code>, and did not need to create the directory, like <code>src/bar/foo.rb</code>.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Independent code loader: By design, Zeitwerk allows each project or app dependency to manage its individual project tree. This means the code loading mechanism of each dependency is managed by that dependency. For example, in Rails 6, Zeitwerk handles code loading for the Rails app and allows each gem dependency to manage its own project tree separately. It is an error condition to have overlapping files between multiple code loaders.</p></li>
<li><p>Autoloading: With the above setup, once the call to <code>setup</code> is made, all classes and modules will be available on demand.</p></li>
<li><p>Reloading: To enable reloading, the <code>loader</code> has to be explicitly configured for it. For example,</p></li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code>  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>enable_reloading</span> <span># you need to opt-in before setup</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>reload</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>loader.reload</code> call reloads the project tree on-the-fly, and any new changes are visible immediately. However, we still need a surrounding mechanism to detect changes to the file system and call <code>loader.reload</code>. A simple version is shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code>  <span>require</span> <span>'filewatcher'</span>

  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>enable_reloading</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>my_filewatcher</span> <span>=</span> <span>Filewatcher</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>'lib/'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>my_filewatcher</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span><span>fw</span><span>|</span> <span>fw</span><span>.</span><span>watch</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span><span>filename</span><span>|</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>reload</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Using Zeitwerk in Rails</h3>

<p>Zeitwerk is enabled by default in Rails 6.0. However, you can opt-out of it and use the Rails <code>classic</code> code loader.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># config/application.rb</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>load_defaults</span> <span>"6.0"</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>autoloader</span> <span>=</span> <span>:classic</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Using Zeitwerk in Gems</h3>

<p>Zeitwerk provides a convenient method for gems, as long as they use the standard gem structure (<code>lib/special_gem</code>). This convenience method can be used as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># lib/special_gem.rb</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>

<span>module</span> <span>SpecialGem</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>for_gem</span>
<span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With the standard gem structure, the <code>for_gem</code> call adds the <code>lib</code> directory as a root namespace, enabling every code in the <code>lib</code> directory to be found automatically.</p>

<p>For more inspiration, you can check out gems using Zeitwerk:</p>

                          Artificial intelligence and robotics are advancing at a rapid pace, with the number of autonomous intelligent machines making moral choices among us continuously on the rise. Knowledge in moral psychology pertaining to artificial intelligence and robotics is important when discussing the ethics of their development.               </p><div>
                          <div><p><a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/projects/moralities-of-intelligent-machines-2">Moralities of Intelligent Machines</a> is a project that investigates peopleâ€™s attitudes towards moral choices made by artificial intelligence. In the latest study completed under the project, study participants read short narratives where either a robot, a somewhat humanoid robot known as iRobot, a robot with a strong humanoid appearance called iClooney or a human being encounters a moral problem along the lines of the trolley dilemma, making a specific decision. The participants were also shown images of these agents, after which they assessed the morality of their decisions. The study was funded by the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation and the Academy of Finland.</p>
<p>The trolley dilemma is a problem where a person sees a trolley careening on the tracks, without anyone in control, towards five people. The person can either do nothing or turn the trolley onto another track, saving the five people but killing another individual on the other track.</p>
<h2>Attitudes more negative towards humanoid robots</h2>
<p>According to the study, people consider the choice made by the humanoid iRobot and iClooney less ethically sound than the same decision made by a human and a robot with a traditional robot-like appearance. <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/people/people-finder/michael-laakasuo-9112809"><strong>Michael Laakasuo</strong></a>, project lead and the principal investigator of the study, links the findings to the uncanny valley effect, which has been identified in prior research.</p>
<p>â€œHumanness in artificial intelligence is perceived as eerie or creepy, and attitudes towards such robots are more negative than towards more machine-like robots. This may be due to, for example, the difficulty of reacting to a humanoid being: is it an animal, a human or a tool?â€�</p>
<p>According to Laakasuo, the findings indicate that humans do not find robots making moral decisions a strange idea, since the decisions made by a human and a traditional robot were seen as equally acceptable. Instead, the appearance of the robot makes a difference to evaluating their morality.</p>
<h2>Discussion guides the regulation of AI</h2>
<p>Laakasuo says that the number of intelligent machines making moral choices is growing in our society, with self-driving cars as an example.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s important to know how people view intelligent machines and what kinds of factors affect related moral assessment. For instance, are traffic violations perpetrated by a stylish self-driving car perceived differently from those of a less classy model?"</p>
<p>This knowledge can influence the direction of AI and robotics development, as well as, among other things, product branding. Knowledge can also shape the political discussion relating to the regulation of artificial intelligence. For example, self-driving cars can become test laboratories of sorts for private companies: in the case of accidents, the consequences can be dealt with using money, risking human health in the name of technological advancement with appeals to consequentialist morals.</p>
<p>â€œWhat kind of robots do we want to have among us: robots who save five people from being run over by a trolley, sacrificing one person, or robots who refuse to sacrifice anyone even if it would mean saving several lives? Should robots be designed to look like humans or not if their appearance affects the perceived morality of their actions?â€�</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Release engineering is on pace with the timelines previously documented to provide a release of Rocky Linux by Q2 2021. The infrastructure team is working on automation in their area to facilitate the deployment of build infrastructure in additional regions. We’ve finalized our sponsorship model, and are as well open to partnerships for deeper collaboration. We’ve drafted our organizational structure, as well as our community charter. Finally, we’ve secured authorization from The Linux Foundation to license Rocky Linux under the Rocky Software Enterprise Foundation, which is the official legal entity that represents Rocky Linux and fosters its growth.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>In our previous update, we listed a number of items and gave dates to them. We remain committed to delivering an initial release of Rocky Linux by Q2. Here are what we listed previously, and where we stand with each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build systems and infrastructure readiness - January 31 [DONE]</li>
<li>Automatic package build infrastructures - January 31 [DONE]</li>
<li>Testing package repository made public - February 28 [In progress]</li>
<li>Installer testing readiness - February 28 [In progress]</li>
<li>ETA for length of time needed for community testing - March 31 [In progress]</li>
<li>Release candidate availability - March 31 [On Pace]</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>The Linux Foundation has granted us a sub-license to legally use “Linux’’ in the distribution’s name “Rocky Linux.” We have renamed the “Rocky Linux Foundation’’ (RESF) to the “Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation” and changed it to a Public Benefits Organization in Delaware.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The build infrastructure for our first deployment in us-east-2 was completed and handed off to the Development team.</p>
<p>The next steps for the Infrastructure team is to ensure documentation (both internal and external) is accurate and up-to-date, and then to finalize the translation of the current infrastructure to automation tooling so we can replicate deployments to additional regions. These regions include Development, us-west-2, and GovCloud. Alerting automation is also in progress, so not only are we monitoring our metrics and syslogs, but when issues arise we are receiving the appropriate notifications to enable the team to respond accordingly in a timely manner. We continue to make progress toward an alternate build infrastructure to AWS and hope to have an announcement by the March community update.</p>
<h2>Release Engineering and Packaging</h2>
<p>The team is working on building packages and getting the processes ready to assemble the final release. This includes things like validating the operation of Pungi (repo/image compositions), and nailing the package build order. An <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/team/development/build_steps">overview of the build process</a> can be found on our wiki. We’re seeking volunteers that can assist with debranding, so if this is an area you’d like to contribute, please reach out! An <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/team/development/debranding/how-to">overview of the steps for debranding</a> is on the wiki, with a more detailed guide to shortly follow.</p>
<h2>Merchandise</h2>
<p>Muckles Inc has begun shipping orders that have been placed, and people have started to receive those items. They were a little surprised by the huge amount of orders that were placed, so it has taken them a little bit longer to process those requests. We’re thankful for your patience, and of course they are still accepting new orders for <a href="https://www.mucklesu.com/collections/rocky-linux">Rocky Linux merch</a>. Please share photos of your Rocky Linux merchandise with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/rocky_linux">Twitter</a>, the <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a>, or <a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/">Mattermost</a>!</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<h3>Community Charter</h3>
<p>Responsibility to the community is critical to our success. To that end, we’ve published The Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation Community Charter, and you can read that <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/community-charter/1933">here</a>. We consider our community charter one of our most important documents, as it communicates to the community what our principles, values, and intentions are. Our responsibility to the community is outlined in our charter; the community’s responsibility is to hold us accountable. We will be embedding this charter in the distribution of the core Rocky Linux operating system, ensuring the longevity and persistence of these principles.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>We’ve expanded upon and published a <a href="https://rockylinux.org/faq/">FAQ</a> which addresses a number of questions that we’ve received. Questions such as “If Rocky Linux is just a respin of RHEL, what’s taking so long for a release candidate?” and “If you’re not just repackaging RHEL, then what exactly are you doing?” and more are all addressed. We will be adding to the FAQ over time based on questions the community surfaces.</p>
<h3>Mattermost</h3>
<p>The migration from Slack to Mattermost has been completed, and all of the legacy Slack channels have been archived. We’ve also set up a bridge from Mattermost to IRC, so if you’re in a Mattermost channel and you see [freenode] BOT , that’s what that’s about. On IRC, Mattermost messages will come from the rlf user, a username subject to change.</p>
<p>Lastly, be sure to check out the <a href="https://mattermost.com/blog/what-matters-episode-12-rocky-linux-with-jordan-pisaniello/">latest episode</a> of “What Matters” a podcast by Mattermost where Community Manager Jordan Pisaniello sits down to discuss Rocky Linux.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Documentation team has been rapidly growing and has made great progress toward putting forward documentation of the highest quality, with a number of community members stepping up and taking ownership of the massive effort. The team is organizing around a number of topics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Packaging</li>
<li>Editorial</li>
<li>Administration</li>
</ul>
<p>and more. For the translation effort, we’re looking for volunteers to support the localization effort into non-English languages.</p>
<p>The team meets virtually once a month to plan and review progress, with scheduling discussed in advance in the <a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation">Documentation channel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation">Please join us</a> on Mattermost and indicate the language or subject area you can assist with. You can also create <a href="https://github.com/rocky-linux/documentation">an issue or pull request on Github</a> to propose a new documentation topic or to help fix existing documentation.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like a special recognition of the Documentation Admin team—Calder Sheagren and Ezequiel Bruni—for helping to keep us organized and on-task.</p>

  <div>                            <p>An artificial neural network with internal memory can be taught to learn complex ultrafast light phenomena in optical fibres such as the generation of a broadband supercontinuum spanning all the color of the spectrum. The network can then predict nonlinear dynamics over extended propagation distances  when the only initial information fed to the network is the input light characteristics and the properties of the nonlinear medium.</p>

</div><div>
  
  <div>                            <p>Researchers at Tampere University have successfully used artificial intelligence to predict nonlinear dynamics that take place when ultrashort light pulses interact with matter. This novel solution can be used for efficient and fast numerical modelling, for example, in imaging, manufacturing and surgery. The findings were published in the prestigious Nature Machine Intelligence journal.</p>
                    </div>
</div><div>
  
  <div>                            <div><p><span><span><span>Artificial intelligence can distinguish different types of laser pulse propagation, just as it recognizes subtle differences of expression in facial recognition. The newly found solution can make it simpler to design experiments in fundamental research and will allow algorithms to be embedded in the next generation of laser systems to ensure real-time optimization. This can be utilised for example in manufacturing and surgery where the pulse properties are perturbed by a target environment.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Nonlinear ultrafast light-matter interactions are something that researchers have struggled to understand for decades. The field of study is of vital importance in many areas of research, ranging from the use of spectroscopic tools in drug development to the precision machining of technological materials and remote sensing to high-resolution imaging. </span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span>Neural networks can be trained to recognize patterns</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>When a high-power ultrashort pulse of light interacts with a glass optical fibre, a range of highly nonlinear interactions take place that cause complex changes in both the temporal and spectral (color) properties of the injected light. Up to now, the study of these nonlinear and multidimensional interactions has been based on nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a slow and computationally demanding method that has limited dramatically the use of numerical techniques to design or optimize experiments in real-time. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“This problem has now been solved by using artificial intelligence. Our team has been able to train a neural network to recognize the patterns inherent in such complex evolution. Significantly, once trained, the network is also able to predict nonlinear evolution for a previously unknown scenario, and can do so essentially instantaneously,” says professor <strong>Goëry Genty</strong>, the leader of the research group at Tampere University and the Director of the national Flagship for Photonics Research and Innovation. <a href="https://prein.fi/">https://prein.fi/</a></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This research uses a specialized architecture known as the recurrent neural network that possesses an internal memory.&nbsp; Such a network can not only recognize specific patterns associated with nonlinear dynamics, but it can also learn how such patterns evolve in both the temporal and spectral domains over an extended distance.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The neural network can predict an evolution in milliseconds<span><span>, which is orders of magnitude faster than direct numerical integration</span></span>. The novel solution will lead to more efficient and faster numerical modelling of all systems where nonlinearity influences propagation, improving the design of devices used in telecommunications, manufacturing, and imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span>New applications available in photonics</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>The study reports two cases of highly significant interest in photonics: extreme pulse compression and ultrabroadband laser source development. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“The approach using a neural network with internal memory allows us to bypass the conventional approach of solving an underlying mathematical model, which is very time consuming and requires sometimes prohibitive memory resources” explains Genty. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With the rapid growth of machine learning applications in all fields of science, Genty anticipates that neural networks will very soon become an important and standard tool for analyzing complex nonlinear dynamics, for optimizing the generation of broadband sources and frequency combs, as well as for designing ultrafast optics experiments.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The research was carried out at Tampere University as part of the Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Physical Sciences and Engineering Program (AIPSE) and within the Academy of Finland’s Flagship for Photonics Research and Innovation (PREIN).</span></span></span></p>

February 25, 2021 | https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/02/make-an-encrypted-usb-with-veracrypt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/02/make-an-encrypted-usb-with-veracrypt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Last week we <a href="https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/02/hide-your-secrets-with-luks/">have talked about encryption and a solution for Linux users</a>. This time, we will cover an Free and Open Source <strong>solution that works for everyone: Windows, MacOS and Linux users: VeraCrypt</strong>. In this guide we will <strong>encrypt your USB stick</strong> step by step, so you can hide your secrets and use it securely across different devices.</p>
<h2 id="warning-remember-the-password">Warning: remember the password</h2>
<p>I have already updated last week post with a warning. It seems trivial but I do not want to be responsible of any data loss :D</p>
<p>The truth is this <strong>if you forget your password, your files are gone</strong>. You will not able to <em>reset your password</em> and wait for an email to come to your Inbox so you can click a direct link to reset everything like magic. Once you encrypt your files with a key, you will can only change your password if you know your previous password.</p>
<figure>

            <p>Searching for your forgotten password. [src:giphy.com]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>No problem!</strong> Right? At this point you already know you can use a <strong><a href="https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/01/why-should-i-have-a-password-manager/">password manager</a></strong> to store your passwords so you do not forget them. Anyway, you can always create a backup of your files in a different (encrypted) drive that you keep at home. In case you forget the password, you can go for your backup.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-veracrypt">What is VeraCrypt?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a> is a Free and Open Source software solution for disk encryption</strong>. It is based on a previous existing project named <em>Truecrypt</em> that is no longer mantained. Nowadays, VeraCrypt is mostly maintained by the <a href="https://www.idrix.fr/Root/">IDRIX</a> group.</p>
<p>Why choosing VeraCrypt? Here are <strong>two advantages</strong>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/compatibility.png" alt="Windows, Linux, MacOS"> <figcaption>
            <p>VeraCrypt is compatible with Linux, Windows and MacOS.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p><strong>VeraCrypt is compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux</strong>. This is a great advantage as you can use it across devices and Operating Systems. You can check their <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Supported%20Operating%20Systems.html">supported OS</a> on their website.</p>
<p>When I once asked one of my (a bit paranoid) Linux Hardening teachers, he answared me with this question: “What is the point of encrypting your USB if you are going to mount it in Windows anyway?” :D</p>
<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>The tool is <strong>maintained by a community</strong> of cryptography experts, it is open to the public and you will never depend on a company changing the price or the software. Moreover, you can trust that many <strong>people is reviewing the code</strong> and it just does what it says it does. If the code is proprietary and closed source, nobody can verify what the application is doing.</p>
<p>The source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt">Github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="get-on-with-it-veracrypt">Get on with it: VeraCrypt</h2>
<p>The next part of the article is about encrypting your USB stick. Keep in mind that VeraCrypt has also other functionalities like encrypting your Windows installation drive, so feel free to check their project and <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Documentation.html">their documentation</a>. Once you encrypt your USB, you can use it normally after mounting it with VeraCrypt.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, <strong>we will use Windows 10</strong>. However, the steps are very similar for other OS. Remember it is also compatible with Linux, MacOS and even RaspberryPi!</p>
<h3 id="install-veracrypt">Install VeraCrypt</h3>
<p>For <strong>creating</strong> the encrypted USB and for <strong>using it</strong>, you need the <strong>VeraCrypt desktop application</strong>. You can download it from their website and verify their PGP signature:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download it: <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html">https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html</a></li>
<li>(Optional) Verify the PGP signature: <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Digital%20Signatures.html">https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Digital%20Signatures.html</a></li>
<li>Launch the installer</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="create-a-new-encrypted-volume">Create a new encrypted volume</h3>
<p>Once you have installed VeraCrypt, it is time to get your USB stick. Fistly, we will see how to create an encrypted partition with an <strong>empty USB stick</strong>. If you already have files on it, you can copy them to a temporary folder or <a href="#existing">you can encrypt the device with them inside</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <em>Create Volume</em> and choose <em>Encrypt a non-system partition/drive</em>.</li>
<li>Choose the <em>Create encrypted volume and format it</em>. This will create a new partition in the USB stick.</li>
<li>Continue with defaults and <strong>set a password</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the format and encrypt your drive. <strong>I recommend choosing FAT</strong> so it is compatible across devices.</li>
<li>Click <em>Format</em> and you are done!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="existing">Extra: Encrypting an existing NTFS partition</h3>
<p>As said, if you <strong>already have a NTFS partition with files</strong>, you can use VeraCrypt to directly encrypt the partition with the files inside. For this you just have to <strong>replace step 2 choosing <em>Encrypt partition in place</em>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="now-what-use-the-encrypted-usb">Now what? Use the encrypted USB</h2>
<p>Now you have your encrypted USB, <strong>you have to unlock it with VeraCrypt</strong>. This is easy:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/use1.png" alt="Usage 1"> <figcaption>
            <p>Select your encrypted USB.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open Veracrypt</strong></li>
<li><strong>Select your device</strong> and choose a letter you want to assign</li>
<li><strong>Click on <em>Mount</em></strong></li>
<li><strong>Type your password</strong></li>
</ol>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/use2.png" alt="Usage 2"> <figcaption>
            <p>Type your password.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>VeraCrypt is a <strong>good solution for encrypting your drives</strong>. The advantages we have seen here make you able to use it for free and across devices. Moreover, it is easy to use through its GUI. I see a problem, though: <strong>no Operating System has native support for VeraCrypt</strong>, so you will have to install the application in every device you want to use your USB stick.</p>
<p><strong>Obri!</strong> Thank you for reading this post. I hope I made you check the VeraCrypt project.</p>

	</p></div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>First month of the new year 2021 has delivered tons of new devices. We are
happy to see new people stepping up and providing the initial support for these
watches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasp-os - Daniel Thompson</li>
<li>Amazfit Neo - xaos</li>
<li>Amazfit GTS 2 Mini - Andreas Shimokawa</li>
<li>Huami Zepp E - Andrew Watkins</li>
<li>Amazfit GTR 2e - Jochen S</li>
<li>Amazfit GTS 2e - Andreas Shimokawa</li>
<li>Amazfit X - Stefan Bora</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to all contributors!</p>
<p>While new devices' support is flowing in, this doesn't mean that all features
and functions of these newly added devices are working, but the initial support
typically already provides many important aspects required for day to day
usage. It also offers a very convenient way to look at these devices in more
detail and help to improve their support further. These Gadgetbridge releases
(0.53.0, 0.54.0 and 0.54.1) also contain many small and big fixes and
improvements all over the place :).</p>
<p>We are super happy to see a wasp-os in the list of supported devices, added by
Daniel Thompson himself. <a href="https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os">Wasp-os</a>
(Watch Application System in Python) is an open-source firmware for smart
watches that are based on the nRF52 family of micro controllers. Currently this
includes the hacker friendly PineTime from Pine64, the Senbono K9 as well as
the Colmi P8, which is a popular device with watch modders.</p>
<p>There have been many improvements done to the Fossil HR thanks to ongoing work
by Daniel Dakhno. It is an interesting piece of hardware and software, which to
some extend provides similar feature set known from the Pebble. Ongoing
development has been focusing on support in Gadgetbridge but also on the
recently introduced app ecosystem of this watch, which is now in early stage
provided by the <a href="https://github.com/dakhnod/Fossil-HR-SDK">Fossil HR SDK</a>.</p>
<p>For those tracking their sports results in Gadgetbridge, imperial units
settings is now honored in the Widget, Activity list and Sports Workouts. We
have also added a small improvement when exporting a GPX track recording,
allowing <a href="https://opentracksapp.com/">OpenTracks</a> to not duplicate these
exports.</p>
<p>For all user-facing changes since the previous blog post, check the following
list:</p>
<h4>0.54.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Amazfit GTS2e: Really fix broken support</li>
<li>Amazfit Bip S Lite: Fix broken support (probably)</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.54.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for Amazfit X</li>
<li>Fix missing menu items for GTS 2 Mini (some improvements also for other GTR2/GTS2 models) </li>

<p>
Well, it's been a year since I started the draft, so I guess it's about time to publish this! :)
</p>
<p>
This is a map of my personal <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a> <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a>, with links to the scripts and tools used; and my blog posts elaborating on different parts of it.
</p>
<p>
My goal for data liberation is approximating the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#data_mirror">'personal data mirror'</a> concept,
often <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">despite</a> crappy interoperability (or lack thereof) of different platforms.
</p>
<p>
I prepared this diagram for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to give more context for my blog posts about data liberation and tools around it</li>
<li>to highlight the complexity and hoops we have to jump over because of the lack of interoperability</li>
<li>it was also sort of fun :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This time I won't write too much text and just let you explore it. <b>Tips for exploring the diagram</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps open the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra_files/myinfra.svg"><b>full size SVG</b></a> in a new tab</li>
<li>make sure to read the legend</li>
<li>links you can follow are marked with blue (and sometimes other colours)</li>
<li>there is a bubble (💬) near some nodes/edges, you can hover it to see the comment</li>
<li>some integrations are in progress: marked with <samp>WIP</samp>, construction signs (🚧🚧) and dashed edges</li>
<li>arrows roughly represent the direction of data flow</li>
<li>arrow colors roughly correspond to the data source (so it's easier to track how it flows)</li>

Some <b>notes</b> regarding the diagram:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it's plotted via graphviz, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/myinfra">here</a> (although the code is quite domain specific)</li>
<li>even though there is a lot of stuff on the diagram, it's still incomplete!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html">here</a> there is an (also incomplete) list of data I collect/export</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/tree/master/my">HPI modules</a> are a good proxy for the data I'm using</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
note that despite some platforms dying (e.g. Jawbone/Endomondo), I can still use data produced with them!
</p>
<p>
E.g. after Endomondo was discontinued, I was able to quickly switch to open source <a href="https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup#readme">RunnerUp app</a>,
while <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/5b501d156266ca8e185d681fab6bc3ee156498a6/my/runnerup.py">preserving</a> complete data compatibility.
</p></li>
<li>note how many services are outright malicious with their <b>anti-API/anti-scraping/anti-interoperability</b> measures (yellow/red highlight for API nodes)</li>
<li>probably more platforms have GDPR exports, I just haven't tried yet</li>
<li><p>
indirection is crazy
</p>
<p>
Note how for some data, before I can get it on my computer, it goes as
</p>
<ul>
<li>device –&gt; phone (over bluetooth)</li>
<li>phone  –&gt; cloud (over internet)</li>
<li>cloud  –&gt; computer (over internet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
for many phone apps <b>the only way</b> I can sync the data is <b>by rooting my phone</b> in order to access the <code>/data/data</code> directory
</p>
<p>
This is getting worse and worse with every Android version. I understand the security concerns, but this is ridiculous.
</p></li>
<li><p>
some modules/packages (marked with<sup>sb</sup> superscript) were developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge">Sean Breckenridge</a>
</p>
<p>
He's forked my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package and working on it <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI">in parallel</a>.
For now, we decided to hack on it independently, in the hope that eventually we figure out what's a good model for cooperating and maintaining the modules.
</p>
<p>
Also, he's done some cool work on <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI_API">automatic HTTP API</a> for HPI!

    <p><img src="https://casparwre.de/images/google-godzilla.jpg" alt="'The Google Beast'"></p>

<h2 id="the-beast-that-is-google">The beast that is Google</h2>
<p>There was a time when Google was a small, quirky company with a single product so awesome that it blew away the competition. That time is long gone.</p>

<p>These days Google is a gigantic multinational mega-corp. But that’s understating it a little. Think of Google as a kind of Godzilla that slurps up data about its users at one end and craps out gold ingots at the other. It does both of these at huge scale.</p>

<p>When thinking about Google, there are three things that are not easy to grasp but which are immensely important:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Google is not a search engine, it is not simply a maker of productivity tools. Google is a giant advertising platform.</li>
  <li>Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform. The gold ingots are coming out at an alarming rate and being used for all kinds of other things.</li>
  <li>Google’s success, the fact that it is so good at what it does, the fact that it is crapping out a mountain of gold ingots, is terrible for us and society.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a quick tour of these points before getting onto Google Analytics.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-not-a-search-engine">Google is not a search engine</h2>
<p>Google is an advertising platform. Everything it does, all of its products, are geared towards selling advertising. Most of its products are free, many of them are useful, and a few are even great. But they all exist to suck up more data so that it can become even better at selling advertising.</p>

<p>The way Google turns data into gold ingots is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Google collects as much data about you as it can.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Google uses this data to get to know you very very well: what you like, what you don’t like, whether you are pregnant, whether you are gay, where your friends live, where you spend your time, what you purchase online.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Google uses its extensive knowledge of you to show you advertising that fits you like a tailor-made suit.</li>
  <li>Step 4: Lots of gold ingots.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> and it’s certainly not about giving you a great user experience, it’s about making money.</p>

<p>To give just one perfect example of the point I’m making: look at the way that paid search results (i.e. adverts) have become ever harder to identify in Google’s search results.</p>

<p><img src="https://casparwre.de/images/google-evolution.jpg" alt="'Google Ads timeline'"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332">Google Ads Timeline compiled by Search Engine Land</a></em></p>

<p>This is not the evolution you expect to see for a company that loves its users. This is what you expect from a mega-corp that wants ever more profits.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-spectacularly-awesomely-frighteningly-successful-as-an-advertising-platform">Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform</h2>
<p>Many of Google’s products have an absolutely staggering market share. Google has nine products with more than one billion users each. Google Chrome is the most popular web browser with a market share of 64%. Google’s Android is the most popular operating system on mobile devices with a market share of 72%. Google’s products are being used by most internet connected humans on earth.</p>

<p>Combine this with the fact that Google has a monopoly on online advertising. Ok, actually that’s not true. It has a duopoly along  with Facebook. Facebook is guilty of most of the things I mention in this post, and is probably worse, but I’m saving my venom for Facebook for another day.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that Google’s revenue is eye-wateringly massive: around 180 billion USD in 2020, which is around the GDP of New Zealand. Now consider that only four years ago, Google’s revenue was 90 billion USD, which means that the revenue doubled in 4 years. Wow!</p>

<p>This mountain of gold ingots used to flow to newspapers and magazines – but no more. The result has been the decimation of local news and the magazine industry. It is true that  news organizations have been terrible at innovation in the past three decades and now they have been steam-rollered as a result. Why is this bad? Read on.</p>

<h2 id="googles-success-is-not-good-for-us-as-a-society">Google’s success is not good for us as a society</h2>

<p>Google’s success is good for Google and its shareholders. It’s not good for us, the consumers. We live in a world where local news is either stone dead or barely surviving. As we have learned in the past few years, a functioning media is essential to democracy.</p>

<p>So has the market done its magic and filled the gap? Has the creation part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">creative destruction</a> happened? Do we now have a better and superior solution for local news?</p>

<p>Nope. Online news articles are a hideous cluster-fuck of click-baiting headlines, cookie banners, privacy nightmares and top heavy with advertising and it’s mostly Google’s fault. Producers of news are desperately wringing every last pathetic drop of profit from their content.</p>

<p>Do you know why online recipes now begin with the author’s life story and are an interminable bore until you reach the actual beef? It’s because of Google. It’s because even writers of online recipes are prostrating themselves before the omnipotent online God that is Google.</p>

<p>And that huge growing pile of gold ingots? That’s in itself a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For many years, the astonishing torrent of money thrown off by Google’s Web-search monopoly has fueled invasions of multiple other segments, enabling Google to bat aside rivals who might have brought better experiences to billions of lives.</p>

  <p>Google Apps and Google Maps are both huge presences in the tech economy. Are they paying for themselves, or are they using search advertising revenue as rocket fuel? Nobody outside Google knows.”  – <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google">Break up Google</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many other nuanced and large problems created by Google’s size and profitability and I’ve only scratched the surface here.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-google-analytics">So what about Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>Google is harvesting data across all of its products, so why pick on Google Analytics? Because for most of the products, if you choose to use them, it’s your data that is harvested. It’s different for Analytics. You as a web developer are making a choice that affects all of your users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Analytics is the most popular website stats tool. More than 53% of all sites on the web track their visitors using Google Analytics. 84% of sites that do use a known analytics script use Google Analytics. It’s the most popular third-party request on the web. It accounts for 0.64% of all network requests.” – <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">Plausible.io blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first began to develop websites, it was a no-brainer to add Google Analytics to anything I created.: “It’s free! It’s good! It’s what everyone uses!”</p>

<p>Actually it’s not that good really:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s a bloated script that affects your site speed</li>
  <li>It’s overkill for the majority of site owners</li>
  <li>It’s a privacy liability and requires an extensive privacy policy</li>
  <li>It worsens the user experience due to the necessity of annoying prompts.</li>
  <li>It’s blocked by many browsers (e.g. Firefox) so the data is not very accurate.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more reasons. You can read the full list <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">here</a>.</p>

<p>Has Google ever revealed what it does with data from Analytics internally? Nope. But we don’t even need to speculate. It seems pretty obvious to me that they’re using it to guzzle up even more data and to crap out ever more gold ingots.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-google-analytics">Alternatives to Google Analytics</h2>
<p>So are there alternatives? Sure, there’s a bunch and some cost money. I think it’s money worth spending.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-analytics">Here is a comprehensive and curated list</a> of analytics tools, including privacy focussed analytics.</p>

<p>I use Fathom Analytics for this blog and am switching all of my products to it. To see the analytics for this blog <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/folzoonq/casparwre.de">click here</a> (note that is an affiliate link – I will earn some money if you signup, you will get 10 USD off).</p>

<p>I believe it is a moral imperative for web developers to think about the “free” tools they are using to provide their products. In the case of Google Analytics, the tool is only very superficially free. We are all paying the hidden costs.</p>

    <p>If you haven't noticed already I really love plain text so I thought I would find some plain text protocols that are used in different software systems. The Redis Protocol specification states it best by describing its own protocol, but this applies to all of the plain text protocols I will cover.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to implement.</li>
<li>Fast to parse.</li>
<li>Human readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next time you are building a software system and have to exchange data start with using a simple plain text protocol and then add in the complexity for optimization later. All of these protocols can be sent as plain text data over a TCP or UDP. They are easily inspected, small, and direct.</p>

<p>Starting off with the simplest one in the list is the Graphite plaintext protocol for delivering metrics into Graphite via Carbon.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;metics_path&gt; &lt;metics_value&gt; &lt;metrics_timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>/cpu_load/core_0 0.08 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_1 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_2 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_3 0.05 1599009388
</code></pre><p><a href="https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>The next simplest one in the list is the Influx Line Protocol. While this is similar to Graphite it does add some additional metadata to its specification.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;measurement&gt;[,&lt;tag_set&gt;...] &lt;field_set&gt;... &lt;timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>cpu,core=0 load=0.08 1599009388
cpu,core=1 load=0.07 1599009388

<p>Here is where things get more complex, but the same 3 characteristics from above apply still. Simplifying the protocol for the sake of brevity in this article we see that the protocol is a single line of text and the initial command dictates what argument data types are allowed after it.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>COMMAND arguments...
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>GET key1
SET key2 100
HSET hash key1 value1
HGETALL hash
</code></pre><p>There is more to this particular protocol to denote strings, numbers, arrays, etc in a text format which is outlined in the official specification.</p>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>Yes, HTTP is just plain text. Since the protocol itself has lots of permutations of metadata lets just look at some examples of an HTTP request and response.</p>
<p>The request example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /articles/plain-text-protocols/ HTTP/1.1
Host: blainsmith.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
</code></pre><p>The response example:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 6262
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 02 Sep 2020 01:41:35 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 02 Sep 2020 01:37:33 GMT

&lt;THE HTML OF THIS ARTICLE&gt;
</code></pre><p>Your browser constructs the request when you visit <a href="http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/">http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/</a> and parses the response when it comes back from the server. There are a lot more allowable headers, but the basics of this protocol are pretty straightforward.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>The world runs on these types of plain text protocol so don't reinvent the wheel if you find yourself building a software system and there is an existing protocol available. If there is an existing plain text protocol that you can adapt to your purposes then do that since there might be a library available already to serialize and deserialize the protocol so you don't have to write your own. If any of these protocols do not fit your needs and you need to write your own then keep it simple. If everyone's web browsers are using HTTP which has worked for decades there is no reason for you to create a complicated protocol unless your can prove the need to otherwise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A safe space to experiment and bring your fintech innovations to life.</p><div><p>Today, we are proud to announce the launch of the <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime Developer Sandbox</a>, a space that allows developers to begin using Treasury Prime’s advanced banking services, all in the safety of an enclosed environment, without requiring a connection to a production bank account. And it's free to use, allows immediate access, and is available now. With the launch of the Developer Sandbox, developers can build in a consequence-free environment. When you don’t have to worry about a typo causing a million dollar error, you're set free to experiment, and experimentation leads to innovation.</p><p>Treasury Prime began with a mission to make banking technology more accessible, while providing enough guide rails to keep things safe and secure. We wanted to design an elegant, powerful API that lets developers do what they do best: change the world by creating innovative software solutions. At the same time–having collectively spent decades working in the banking industry–our team knows the substantial value that banks provide. As such, we also strive to empower banks to do what they do best: risk management, security at scale, and providing knowledgeable customer support. So, by helping to match the fintechs inventing the future with the forward-looking banks who are here to support them, Treasury Prime aims to enable a new generation of financial innovation.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>The Developer Sandbox allows you to test all of the Treasury Prime APIs (with a few minor exceptions), so you can build a proof of concept quickly and get to market fast. There is no cost for using this environment, so you are free to build and test as long as you like without worrying about fees or contracts. And when you’re ready to make the jump to production, you just need to swap out your environment URLs and generate some production API keys. You’ll also need to get connected with a bank, which is why we’ve partnered with a growing number of banks to make sure we can help connect almost any fintech with a banking partner.<br></p><p>The Treasury Prime APIs were designed around the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>, and all response bodies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> encoded, so they should feel familiar to almost anyone who’s worked with APIs before, and be easy to understand for those who are new to the game. So what exactly can you do with Treasury Prime's APIs?</p><ul role="list"><li>Apply to open new bank accounts</li><li>Issue branded debit cards</li><li>Make deposits with remote deposit capture</li><li>Make payments and card transactions&nbsp;</li><li>Fund accounts</li></ul><p>And that’s just to name a few… So, now that you know a bit more about what <em>we</em> do, let's take a look at how <em>you</em> can build the next big fintech innovation!</p><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>In the examples below, we’ll look at how you can transfer funds between two accounts at the same bank using a book transfer, then follow that up by checking the available balance on an account.<br></p><p>If you’d like to follow along, you can <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Developer Sandbox account</a> (it’s fast and painless I promise). Once you’ve signed up, you can then log into the Developer Sandbox, and generate a set of API Keys which will be used to authenticate your requests. In our examples these keys are shown as <em>$API_KEY_ID </em>and <em>$API_SECRET_KEY.</em>&nbsp;You'll need to swap these out with Key ID&nbsp;and Secret&nbsp;Key you generate in your sandbox when making requests.<br></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If you’d like more in-depth information on any of our APIs, please see our </em><a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs" target="_blank"><em>API Reference Documentation</em></a><em>.</em></p><h4>Book Transfer</h4><p>A book transfer is an electronic funds transfer between two accounts at the same bank. In this example we’ll look at how you can transfer funds from a checking account to a savings account.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>A checking and savings account are automatically created in your Developer Sandbox for testing purposes.</em><br></p><p>The first step in creating a book transfer is to obtain the IDs of the accounts you wish to transfer funds between. To accomplish this, make a GET request to the <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">account</a> endpoint.</p><div><pre><code>curl -u $API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY https://api.treasuryprime.com/account
</code></pre></div><p>This will return a list of <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">Account</a> objects. In order to make a book transfer, you will need the account ID for both the sending and receiving accounts, which are stored in the<em> '</em>id' property of each account object.</p><div><pre><code>{
    "data": [{
        "account_type": "savings",
        "bank_id": "bank_treasuryprime",

        "userdata": null
    }],
    "total_estimated": 10
}
</code></pre></div><p>After obtaining the IDs of the accounts you wish to transfer funds between, you have all the necessary information required to issue a book transfer. To accomplish this, make a POST request to the <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#book" target="_blank">book</a> endpoint, passing the 'amount' of the transfer, as well as the 'from_account_id' and the 'to_account_id' (representing the funding account and receiving account respectively).<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>You will need to replace the 'from_account_id' and 'to_account_id' values with those from your own account.</em></p><div><pre><code>curl -u $API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY https://api.treasuryprime.com/book \\
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
    -d '{
          "amount": "100.00",
          "from_account_id": "acct_1234567890",
          "to_account_id": "acct_0987654321"
        }'
</code></pre></div><p>A successful response will return a <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#book" target="_blank">Book Transfer</a> object. Note that the status of this request is currently set to "pending". You can register <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#webhooks" target="_blank">webhooks</a> to notify you when the transfer is complete, but that is a bit beyond the scope of this example.<br></p><div><pre><code>{
  "amount": "100.00",

  "userdata": null
}
</code></pre></div><p>Congratulations, you’ve just made your first book transfer! Next let’s quickly check the account balance of the receiving account.</p><h4>Check Account Balance</h4><p>To check the available balance on an account, make a request to the <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">account</a> endpoint including the ID of the account you provided for the 'to_account_id' above.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>You will need to replace the :id below with the account ID of one of the accounts in your developer sandbox (you can use the same account ID provided for the 'to_account_id' value above, or any other account of your choosing).</em><br></p><div><pre><code>curl -u "$API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY" https://api.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/account/:id
</code></pre></div><p>The response data includes a lot of information about the account, including the 'available_balance' which shows the amount of money in the account that is immediately available for transactions.<br></p><div><pre><code>{
  "address": {
    "street_line_1": "123 Kearny St",
    "street_line_2": null,

  "created_at": "2021-01-28T14:47:11Z",
  "userdata": null
}
</code></pre></div><h3>Recap</h3><p>Great work! In a matter of minutes, you’ve been able to transfer funds between two bank accounts, and check the available balance of an account. Banking can seem intimidating to work with at first, but–as you’ve hopefully now discovered–it doesn’t have to be. We’ve worked hard to make working with financial services as fast and easy as possible, all so you can share your next great innovation with the world.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We truly believe that fintechs have the opportunity to change the way that finance works and empower every person to take control of their financial future. And by working with the right banking partner, you’ll have the backing of a team who can help you avoid any roadblocks and ensure your solution scales in a safe and secure way.<br></p><p>If you’ve made it this far and still haven’t <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/">signed up</a> for a Developer Sandbox account, what are you waiting for?&nbsp; You could build your proof of concept in the next few days, and have a product ready to hit the market in a matter of weeks. We can’t wait to see what you build!<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>The rules extraction from the Decision Tree can help with better understanding how samples propagate through the tree during the prediction. It can be needed if we want to implement a Decision Tree without <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">Scikit-learn</a> or different than Python language. Decision Trees are easy to move to any programming language because there are set of <code>if-else</code> statements. I’ve seen many examples of moving scikit-learn Decision Trees into C, C++, Java, or even SQL.</p>

<p>In this post, I will show you 3 ways how to get decision rules from the Decision Tree (for both classification and regression tasks) with following approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>built-in text representation,</li>
  <li>convert a Decision Tree to the code (can be in any programming language)</li>
  <li>convert a Decision Tree to <strong>set of rules which are human-readable</strong> (my favourite approach)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to visualize your Decision Tree model, then you should see my article <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/visualize-decision-tree/">Visualize a Decision Tree in 4 Ways with Scikit-Learn and Python</a></p>

<p>If you want to train Decision Tree and other ML algorithms (Random Forest, Neural Networks, Xgboost, CatBoost, LighGBM)  in an automated way, you should check our open-source AutoML Python Package on the GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">mljar-supervised</a></p>

<h3 id="train-decision-tree-on-classification-task">Train Decision Tree on Classification Task</h3>

<p>Let’s train a <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html"><code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code></a> on the <code>iris</code> dataset. I will use default hyper-parameters for the classifier, except the <code>max_depth=3</code> (don’t want too deep trees, for readability reasons).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>import</span> <span>pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>

<h2 id="scikit-learn-built-in-text-representation">Scikit-Learn Built-in Text Representation</h2>

<p>The Scikit-Learn Decision Tree class has an <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_text.html"><code>export_text()</code></a>. It returns the text representation of the rules.</p>

<p>There isn’t any built-in method for extracting the <code>if-else</code> code rules from the Scikit-Learn tree. We need to write it. The code below is based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39772170/5605919">StackOverflow answer</a> - updated to Python 3.</p>

<p>The above code recursively walks through the nodes in the tree and prints out decision rules. The rules are presented as python function. The below <code>predict()</code> code was generated with <code>tree_to_code()</code>. You can easily adapt the above code to produce decision rules in any programming language.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>“Bitcoin mining is an environmental disaster.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve probably come across a few articles making claims like above. Bitcoin mining is energy intensive. But should we be concerned that its energy consumption and carbon emissions pose a real threat to society?</p><p>In this article, we compiled a collection of studies and arguments made over the years as to why Bitcoin mining is not an environmental disaster and how it tends to be misunderstood in the mainstream. Our goal is to distill these arguments and present them in a cohesive way.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining is Necessary&nbsp;</h2><p>Miners confirm transactions on the Bitcoin network. They ensure nobody cheats the system. To do this, they compete with each other to have their block of transactions added to the existing blocks (ie. the blockchain). The first one to do so, earns a reward. They compete through hash computations. The more hashes produced, the greater the probability of winning the reward. By converting electricity into hashes they prove to the network that they have paid a cost to participate which anybody can verify.</p><blockquote><em>“This system is the most simplistic and fair way for the physical world to validate something in the digital world.”&nbsp;<br>“Proof of Work (PoW) transmutes electricity into digital gold.”&nbsp;<br>— Dan Held in </em><a href="https://medium.com/@danhedl/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3"><em>Proof of Work is Efficient</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p>Does this give Bitcoin a legitimate claim on society’s resources?&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin power usage seems less extreme when compared to power usage of <a href="https://medium.com/braiins/so-you-think-bitcoin-mining-is-wasteful-f93cf849a2b9">video game consoles</a> or <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption-us-christmas-lights/">Christmas lights</a>. However, it appears significant when it consumes as much electricity as small countries. Perspective matters here. But the fact is people are paying to have their transactions included in the blockchain. Something voluntarily exchanged cannot by definition be a waste. People are benefiting from using Bitcoin and that’s why they are subsidizing miners. For an individual to say that this is a poor use of society’s resources because <em>they </em>don’t find Bitcoin valuable is akin to them complaining that other people shouldn’t be able to buy video game consoles and consume electricity to play them because <em>they </em>don’t like video games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption</h3><p>One important factor to consider is that Bitcoin mining can take place anywhere in the world. Unlike traditional mining operations (e.g. for gold or diamonds), Bitcoin mining is highly distributed geographically and can move to wherever power is cheap.&nbsp;</p><p>Claims are often made that because Bitcoin mining is energy intensive, it becomes a drain in areas where it occurs. This is inaccurate.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, Bitcoin mining operations are most commonly located in areas where there is an oversupply of electricity. Why? Because these are the areas where electricity is cheapest — supply is greater than demand and existing technology is not sufficient to effectively store and&nbsp; transport supply to population centers where demand is higher. This is important for mining operations because electricity costs can account for up to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-bitcoin-miners-consume-reasonable-amount-energy-and-its-all-worth-it/">70% of their total costs</a> of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Estimates suggest about <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019">65% of global mining occurs in China</a>, and the province of Sichuan alone produces ~54% of global hashrate. This is largely due to an overbuild of hydroelectric power in the provinces of Sichuan and Xinjiang. The installed hydro capacity is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hydropower/dam-nation-big-state-projects-spared-in-chinas-hydro-crackdown-idUSKCN1LF2RG">double what its power grid can support</a>, leading to an enormous quantity of surplus electricity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5f8337c352384d6ba3fe3748_5f4669a213b9108401ffcafc_YkZU2MitNpEsZwIUuhJRFkdPszwS7o_0g2VgOZOr3x1WYCOaa6fyEMKWSfUcRQ3Oafryh_4-fCuyB3EeHGZn4ER4D5QqNN_BqAKwIkfzOBEpNk1zULiY-B5-DzFnWSmDZ_Sf_zk.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Source: Coinshares Bitcoin Mining Report - December 2019</em></figcaption></figure><p>As Nic Carter summarizes in his <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption">article</a> on Bitcoin’s energy consumption,</p><blockquote><em>“Part of the reason Bitcoin consumes so much electricity is because China lowered the clearing price of energy by overbuilding hydro capacity due to sloppy central planning. In a non-Bitcoin world, this excess energy would either have been used to smelt aluminum or would simply have been wasted.”</em></blockquote><p>Hydropower is effective for Bitcoin mining as the marginal cost of generation is essentially zero and it is a stable source of production. A study performed by the BitMEX research group revealed that the <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/mining-incentives-part-2-why-is-china-dominant-in-bitcoin-mining/">majority of Chinese Bitcoin mining operations</a> are in areas of relative oversupply from hydropower operations.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5f8337c386c45172975631c5_5f466c06dae6771f273c63fd_7_siB1LtkEifUfFF91H8U7xbNXuMyheBuq69rn7DA8jgNiB3MeoD8VBHPc6GRVjBdz3SqFUIS3WfUGzWd6Pt6lvBqiLZImxAIY55xoOSWyApTJSIG4j6vm49sZCSGz8tJTaT3u8.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Source: Coinshares Bitcoin Mining Report - December 2019</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍<strong>In summary, Bitcoin mining typically consumes electricity which would never reach an energy grid in a large population center.</strong> Any honest comparison of energy consumption between Bitcoin mining and other sources like heating and air conditioning or video game playing should account for this fact.</p><p>And to be clear, these mechanics incentivizing mining to occur in locations of overproduction (a majority of which is renewable energy) are applicable to Bitcoin mining outside of China, as well. On a global scale, it’s estimated that some <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019">74% of all Bitcoin mining electricity comes from renewable energy sources</a>.</p><h2>The Takeaway&nbsp;</h2><p>Bitcoin’s energy consumption often gets singled out because it’s easy to quantify. Yes, <strong>Bitcoin mining is energy intensive</strong>. However,<strong> this is a necessary component of Bitcoin’s value proposition</strong>: borderless, scarce, digital, censorship resistant cash that you can use without trusting a 3rd party.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t recognize the value of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, perhaps it’s because you haven’t experienced slow and expensive cross-border transactions, hyperinflation, or financial censorship and disclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, let’s acknowledge a simple fact. <strong>If Bitcoin became worthless, all mining would stop.</strong> To put it bluntly: if you still believe that mining is highly problematic for the world, your best option is to work on improving the existing financial system to be more inclusive, more efficient, and more trustworthy so that it can outcompete Bitcoin and thus weaken the incentive for miners to operate.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h3>Get notified when we release new update</h3><div><div><p>Wohoo!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to mining centralization, the big concern that people have is a “51% attack” —&nbsp; where a single actor or group controls a majority of Bitcoin’s mining power and can effectively decide which transactions (if any) get confirmed in the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides just disrupting or censoring the confirmation of new transactions, a 51% attack can also be used for a <em>double spend</em>. This means that the attacker mines a different version of the blockchain in secret so that they can spend some coins on the public chain and then later mute the transaction by publishing their version of the blockchain in which they retain ownership of the coins. Another name for this is a blockchain reorganization because it replaces the most recent blocks in the chain.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, there have been no successful 51% attacks on Bitcoin in its history, but we have seen successful attacks on other coins like <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-classic-etc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-33be13ce32de">Ethereum Classic</a>. <strong>If successful, such an attack would likely cause significant harm to Bitcoin’s reputation.</strong></p><h2>Measuring 1-Hour Cost of a 51% Attack</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff87059f5e95d17a5a0a826_SvpEcuX1WYEhxLGTMVanrolfdB6b6bn9BvePdjV9gXpUswxB4G8W9KSNpjVoCQV0rRrkOJL01VZYoxCePo0ig9gTT35_oNst_kTVXdCFNtwbD-NDZI9bxFlgpgsGNl_KpfteRqs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Source: Crypto51.app</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s a cool website called <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">Crypto51</a> which measures the cost to 51% attack Bitcoin and other major proof of work cryptocurrencies. If you go to the About page, it describes how the <em>1h Attack Cost</em> is calculated using the current market price (aka <em>spot price</em>) for hashrate from NiceHash (NH), a hashrate exchange that allows people to buy hashpower from miners and control what it’s used for. For non-miners, the significance of this may not be clear, so let’s explain it.</p><p>Supposing that a certain blockchain has a total network hashrate of 100 TH/s, then the cost of a 1-hour 51% attack is the cost of controlling more than 50 TH/s of the hashrate. <strong>If a majority of the hashrate is available on a hashrate exchange, then the 1-hour attack cost is simply the cost of purchasing that hashrate from the market for 1 hour.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>On Crypto51, the portion of a given cryptocurrency’s hashrate that’s available for purchase is represented by the <em>NiceHash-able</em> metric on the right side of the image above. A NH-able value below 100% means that less than 51% of the coin’s hashrate can be bought.</p><p><strong>For Bitcoin, the NH-able value is under 1%</strong>, and other hashrate exchanges do not add much to the value. In other words, the 1h Attack Cost is calculated based on the <em>spot</em> <em>price</em> for SHA-256 hashrate, but the volume of SHA-256 hashrate available on the market is not nearly large enough to make it a viable way to actually attack Bitcoin.</p><p>Since the value on Crypto51 isn’t realistic for Bitcoin, let’s dive into more detail about the <strong>different methods that could be used to 51% attack Bitcoin, how feasible they are, and what can be done to mitigate them.</strong> By the end, you’ll better understand the security provided by Bitcoin’s proof of work system.</p><h2>Bitcoin Cloud Mining and Hashrate Exchanges</h2><p>For most people, it will never be profitable to mine Bitcoin. This is because competitive electricity prices are typically only found in locations with energy production (e.g. hydroelectric dams, natural gas wells, etc.), not on an urban energy grid.</p><p>However, for people who want to speculate on <a href="https://insights.braiins.com/profitability-calculator">mining profitability</a>, cloud mining offers a way to do so. Cloud mining contracts enable people to “mine” cryptocurrencies without owning the physical hardware themselves. In other words, buyers purchase a specific amount of hashrate for a specific time period and price, then earn the mining rewards produced by that hashrate. Meanwhile, the miners still operate the mining equipment, but they get paid via the cloud mining contracts or hashrate market rather than the mining rewards.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff8705975e8eb045ae2acfd_luPmOaLr5shJUFvumj0DDWQqEqEcFVi8QUeHbywHDY1DwkFLD4qRAgnY8YOY-SFak3QOPoDoESLSh6Tw6nqWqrFvh8h3nRKU6LBIFgZIhzk5b4CBXwlIV3SrirEvxsCsURNcKeg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Hypothetical example of cloud mining contracts</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make a clear distinction, from now on we will refer to hashrate sold on an exchange or via cloud mining contracts as <strong><em>synthetic hashrate</em></strong>, and hashrate used to mine directly as <strong><em>physical hashrate</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what does this have to do with Bitcoin’s security?</p><p><strong>Well, if a malicious actor wanted to attack a cryptocurrency network, it would be far simpler to purchase synthetic hashrate than to produce physical hashrate. </strong>However, there’s not nearly enough hashpower on hashrate exchanges to consider them as an attack vector against Bitcoin.</p><p>That being the case, let’s talk about the other possible attack methods.</p><h2>The Cost of a 51% Attack with Physical Hashrate</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff870592075d921f98c3937_Z0p_QkL9w9mZtEPkLUGmYBsLrlfvpdhdZrnHXPwQsz_jpEHdRu3Y1uoeK_7QtRTcVzNYA_R-3ZqW8B_g2uJ_B983Z3vcieFdQSAKsKDTKueXhECHqxhFDyjLP3ZZGNIrN9JipHE.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>With hashrate exchanges not being viable for accessing 51% of network hashrate, there are only two realistic attack vectors left:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Amassing enough ASICs (mining hardware) and power capacity to attack the network with physical hashrate</li><li>Controlling mining pools who have a combined majority of the synthetic hashrate</li></ul><p>Let’s start by analyzing the first case. <strong><em>How much would it cost to 51% attack Bitcoin with physical hashrate?</em></strong></p><p>With the current total network hashrate of 150 EH/s, we’ll calculate a rough estimate of the costs necessary to set up 150 EH/s worth of ASICs (assuming the miners with the existing 150 EH/s remain honest and don’t contribute to the attack). In the most favorable case where all hashrate is produced by an equivalent machine to the highest efficiency ASIC on the market today, the Antminer S19 Pro, then the specifications per ASIC would be <em>110 TH/s</em> and <em>3250 W</em> consumption.</p><p>150,000,000 TH/s / 110 TH/s = approximately <strong>1.364M ASICs needed to amass 150 EH/s.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>With a per-unit consumption of 3250 W, that would put the<strong> electricity capacity needed to power all those ASICs at ~4.4 GW of power</strong>. That limits the possible candidates to pull off such a huge endeavor to powerful nation states who would work in coordination with large energy producers.&nbsp;</p><p>And how much would those 1.364M ASICs cost the taxpayers of such a nation state? Well, at a conservative unit price of $4000 each including power supply units, the <strong>cost of hardware would exceed $5.46 billion</strong>. Factoring in all the R&amp;D costs to catch up to existing hardware manufacturers (who are already <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/secondary-markets-asic-bitcoin-mining-manufacturing-delays">sold out</a> until May 2021), plus all the other data center equipment needed, the true cost would likely be far higher.</p><p>In the grand scheme, this may still be a small sum to the likes of the USA or China. However, it doesn’t account for significant obstacles such as the limited capacity of chip manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC to actually produce these high quality hashing chips. (Not to mention the lunacy of a government using that semiconductor manufacturing capacity to build ASICs and attack Bitcoin rather than any number of other <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/cn/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-cn-tmt-semiconductors-the-next-wave-en-190422.pdf">valuable applications</a>.)&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In TSMC's 2018 annual report, the company produced 10,436 products for 481 customers. They have limited manufacturing space at their facilities and have to account for massive customers outside of the bitcoin mining space, including Sony, Qualcom, Broadcom, and, famously, Apple.</p>— Amanda Fabiano (@_amanda_fab) <a href="https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab/status/1338190445717770240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>‍<strong>Ultimately, attempting to destroy trust in Bitcoin through a mining attack with physical hashrate just doesn’t make sense anymore, and it hasn’t for years. </strong>Nation states who view Bitcoin as a threat are far more likely to over-regulate or (try to) ban its use than to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on mining hardware and power.</p><p>Still, that doesn’t mean that 51% attacks are completely impossible. Let’s now turn our attention back to synthetic hashrate. This time, instead of talking about hashrate exchanges and cloud mining, we’ll discuss mining pools.</p><h2>Synthetic Hashrate and China Mining Centralization&nbsp;</h2><p>Bitcoin mining pool centralization has been a near-constant source of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) for years. However, it's usually misrepresented. <strong>Mining pool operators have long-term stakes in the Bitcoin network and just as little incentive to attempt an attack as miners themselves.</strong></p><p>You can read an explanation of why hashrate concentration is not a huge cause for concern in this <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/no-concentration-among-miners-isnt-going-to-break-bitcoin">Coindesk article</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A more interesting case to think about is if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were to try taking over several mining pool operations. Currently, ~97% of Bitcoin’s total network hashrate goes through Chinese pools.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ffc51f0aa5822321d9217ea_hashrate-distribution-jan11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Bitcoin hashrate distribution chart; source:&nbsp;coin.dance</figcaption></figure><p>It’s extremely unlikely that the CCP will attempt any attack. Nonetheless, we’ll consider the possibility for a simple reason: attacking with physical hashrate would cost at least $5 billion, whereas attacking with synthetic hashrate by taking over several pools would be essentially FREE.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there’s a problem with this attack too: <strong>miners can switch pools in a matter of seconds. </strong>If the CCP were to attempt taking over the 4+ largest pools, they would have to hope that no miners switch to other pools so that they can sustain the attack for more than a few pointless minutes.</p><p>The less concentrated hashrate is in a few mining pools, the more difficult it would be to attempt a pool attack. However, mining pools are necessary for most miners today to stabilize their revenue, and concentration in a few pools is unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Therefore, one good way to increase the difficulty of a mining pool attack is to make it impossible to do covertly.</strong> In other words, the attack causes more damage the longer it is sustained, so it can be mitigated by ensuring that some miners would detect it within minutes and switch pools.&nbsp;</p><h2>Blockchain Reorganizations</h2><p>Every block in the blockchain references the block before it with a value in the block header called the <em>prevhash</em>. With Stratum V2, miners will be able to construct blocks themselves with data from their own nodes (a process called <em>Job Negotiation</em>), so if they are honest they’ll always reference the prevhash of the most recent block in the chain.&nbsp;</p><p>By taking block construction out of the pools’ hands, Stratum V2 can help miners ensure that they won’t contribute to secretly mining a “shadow” chain that gets broadcasted later in a blockchain reorganization attack. Similarly, they can ensure that their hashrate is not used to mine a different SHA-256 chain, such as Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff8705a486828862383eaa0_1g3TGyPQbP_BtqcKtlydb-K4BvCluBo-ERty8nsQt7EkRnQuBPnw_kNZHhD15uKhfV9asWCtr2qtL1DJqDDHKwup-j3RA59wbPq_VXS_kxgi4N9EQ9pW7rRvi37JH4XOcx4Liks.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The chain with the largest block height is considered valid, so mining a longer chain in …</figcaption></figure></div></div>

			<p><span>I</span>n the past quarter century, enrollment in college English departments has sunk like the Pequod in <i>Moby Dick</i>. Meanwhile enrollment in science programs has skyrocketed. It’s understandable. Elon Musk, not Herman Melville, is the role model of the digital economy. But it doesn’t have to be that way, says Angus Fletcher, 44, an English professor at Ohio State University. Fletcher is part of “group of renegades,” he says, who are on a mission to plug literature back into the electric heart of contemporary life and culture. Fletcher has a plan—“apply science and engineering to literature”—and a syllabus, <i>Wonderworks: The 25 Most Powerful Inventions in the History of Literature</i>, his new book.</p><p>Before the England-born Fletcher got his Ph.D. in literature at Yale, he earned an undergraduate degree in neuroscience, followed by a four-year stint in a neurophysiology lab at the University of Michigan. He switched careers when he realized the biology of the brain wouldn’t take him far enough toward understanding our need for stories. “What’s special about the human brain is its power of storytelling,” Fletcher says. “Its power of narrative. Its power to invent futures and tell our past. So, I thought, ‘I’ll go to an English department and learn about narrative.’” Fletcher sees the human brain as mechanical, but insists it doesn’t operate like a computer. He spelled out his view for <i>Nautilus</i> readers in “<a href="https://nautil.us/issue/95/escape/why-computers-will-never-write-good-novels" target="_blank">Why Computers Will Never Write Good Novels</a>.”&nbsp;(The essay generated a lot of discussion. See Fletcher’s response below.)</p> <p><i>Wonderworks</i> consists of 25 chapters that delve into works from the <i>Iliad</i> to <i>Emma</i>, <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> to <i>My Brilliant Friend</i>, each representative of a particular “invention” to lighten sorrow or grief or create empathy or joy. “Each of these inventions had a unique purpose, engineered with its own intricate circuitry to click into our psyche in a different way,” Fletcher writes. <i>Wonderworks</i> is captivating, as is Fletcher, who speaks with infectious enthusiasm and clarity. I began our conversation on Zoom with a question about the difference between the human brain and a computer, the subject of his <i>Nautilus</i> article, and then turned to his provocative view that to save the humanities, literature must be taught as a science.</p><figure data-alt="Berger_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18197_cea7785b31f6a028bfa54af07d6f79ce.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>STORY SCIENTIST:</strong> Angus Fletcher once worked in a neuroscience lab. “But I had this conversion moment where I thought, ‘By studying the synapse, it’s just too small to answer the big questions about narrative and life,’” he says. So he said goodbye to the lab and became a professor of English at Ohio State University, where he teaches “story science.”</span><span>Sarah Lagrotteria</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>Is a big part of the difference between human brains and computers the fact that computers lack consciousness?</b><br></p><p>No. I’m making a completely mechanical argument for novels, literature, and narrative. Consciousness is like the existence of the 913th dimension. It may exist. It’s not up to me to say that it doesn’t exist. But I can tell you right now, no human is ever going to establish a definitive proof one way or the other. That’s because it’s a metaphysical problem. Humans exist in a physical space. The reason science and engineering have advanced is because we bracketed the problem of consciousness as something unanswerable. So it’s possible that computers are conscious. It’s possible that they’re not. That’s something I don’t think anyone can answer.</p><p><b>How did science advance because the problem of consciousness is unanswerable?</b></p><p>Let me say it this way. We can get everything we want in the world without understanding where consciousness comes from. So why are we pouring all this energy into it? The only reason for doing it is because people have a religious spiritual impulse. It’s like chasing God. We know where that got the monks in the Middle Ages.</p><p><b>Where did that get the monks?</b></p><p>It didn’t get them to invent the laws of thermodynamics or invent computers or discover evolution by natural selection. It got them into a lot of arguments. I think humans enjoy having arguments about irresolvable problems. It gives us something to do. What’s the best baseball team? What’s the source of consciousness? But other than as a ludic pastime, consciousness is not something that I think anyone would seriously investigate scientifically.</p><blockquote><p>Pragmatism isn’t the enemy of beauty. Pragmatism allows beauty to happen.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Are you saying the study of metaphysics did not lead to developments in science?</b><br></p><p>That’s exactly right. That’s the narrative I would tell. In the Middle Ages, people were obsessed with the questions, “Who is God? What does God want?” But we discovered over time, starting with Machiavelli and moving into Francis Bacon and the 19th- and 20th-century scientific revolutions, that the human brain can’t answer those questions. That’s because the human brain has evolved to practice science. Science is about making hypotheses and testing them in our physical world. It’s not about reaching the metaphysical. And literature is the origin of the modern scientific method.</p><p><b>Why do you call literature a technology?</b></p><p>A technology is any human-made thing that solves a problem. Most of our technology exists to master our world, to domesticate space. That’s why we have smartphones and smart homes and satellites. Literature tackles the opposite set of problems: not how to master the nonhuman world but how to master ourselves. It wrestles with the psychological problems inside us. Grief, lack of meaning, loneliness—literature was invented to deal with these problems. To have happy and democratic societies, effective engineers and scientists, we need people who are joyful, not angry, who have a deep sense of empathy and purpose, who have an ability for logic and problem-solving. You get all these things from literature.</p><p><b>When you call literature a technology, it sounds like you’re saying literature’s a machine.</b></p><p>I <i>am</i> saying it’s a machine! It’s a machine designed to work in concert with another machine, our brain. The purpose of the two machines is to accelerate each other. Literature is a way of accelerating human imagination. And human imaginations accelerate literature. This technology is just sitting on our bookshelves and almost none of us are using it. Students now flee literature departments for the sciences and engineering.</p><p><b>That makes the act of imagination sound so mechanical, don’t you think?</b></p><p>In one regard, narrative is a mechanical act. It doesn’t require imagination. It doesn’t require free will. It’s possible humans have no imagination and no free will. Yet we can still write novels and poetry because the fundamental constituent of those things is narrative. Now, the reason that people sometimes think that narrative is creative or imaginative is because narrative is not logical. It exists in the hypothetical, the counterfactual, the speculative. You can never write a true or a false novel. All you can write is a fictional novel. That’s why we might think of it as being imaginative. In the same way, we might think of anything that an engineer creates as being imaginative. But what we’re really saying is the novel is outside the realm of the logical. It’s in a different machine space, the machine space of narrative.</p><div>

</div><p><b>In the past 20 years, enrollment in English departments has dropped by 25 percent, while enrollment in STEM classes has doubled. Why is that?</b></p><p>I can tell you exactly why that is. English literature is not being taught in a way that is connecting with people. We’ve been taught in school to interpret literature, to say what it means, to identify its themes and arguments. But when you do that, you’re working against literature. I’m saying we need to find these technologies, these inventions, and connect them to your head, see what they can do for your brain. Literature isn’t about telling you what’s right or wrong or about giving you ideas. It’s about helping you troubleshoot your own head.</p><p><b>The chapters in <i>Wonderworks</i> include fun names for the inventions of literature. The names include “Almighty Heart,” “Serenity Elevator,” “Sorrow Resolver,” “Virtual Scientist.” How did literature invent the virtual scientist?</b></p><p>A virtual scientist has no ego. Our brains are born scientists. From the moment we’re born, we make hypotheses about what will happen if we do something. Then we test those hypotheses. We might say, “If I stick my hand in the fire, it might burn.” And then we stick our hand in the fire. We’re like, “Yes, that did burn.” We’re constantly running these experiments in our lives. We build stories and narratives as a way of organizing them. But what holds us back as scientists is our egos. That’s because we just don’t like to think we’re wrong. Present someone with a piece of data that contradicts what they think and they will deny your data. They will bend your data to fit their hypothesis. This is an endemic psychological process of the human mind.</p><p>So the question is, “How do we become better scientists?” The way to do that is to remove our ego. Literature provides us the space to do that. What is Sherlock Holmes doing? Sherlock Holmes has given us a problem that we need to solve experimentally by positing hypotheses, by testing them. But we’re not Sherlock Holmes and so it’s not embarrassing if we happen to be wrong. Sherlock Holmes and tons of great detective fiction allow us to play virtual scientists by going into a space where our ego doesn’t exist and we can practice our scientific method of making predictions and testing them.</p><blockquote><p>Most of our technology exists to domesticate space. Literature tackles the opposite: how to master ourselves.</p> </blockquote><p><b>I will say, Angus, <i>Wonderworks</i> made me a little anxious.

  <time datetime="2021-02-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Feb 2021 ~ 4 minute read</time>
  <p>For the record, the process of leaving comments on my own pull requests isn’t something I came up with on my own. I adopted it from a previous colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/jean_cochrane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean Cochrane</a>.</p>

<p>A while ago, Jean was being onboarded onto a team I was responsible for. Part of the onboarding process involved working through a <a href="https://www.azavea.com/blog/2018/10/10/engineer-onboarding-breakable-toy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakable toy</a> exercise, which is a project similar in toolset to the ones we’d work on day-to-day, but different in scope. As part of going through that, I encouraged Jean to take notes on any steps of the exercise that weren’t clear. Jean took that further and annotated each associated pull request with comments containing their in-context notes.</p>

<p>As a reviewer, it was phenomenal to have those prompts front and center. With them, we could immediately begin cutting through any existing ambiguity and work toward a joint understanding of the changes. <mark>It was a refreshing experience, and I’ve been trying to reproduce it for all of my pull request reviewers ever since.</mark></p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>Over the years, I’ve refined the process I use before assigning my pull requests for review. In the beginning, it consisted of making sure my changes worked and looked acceptable. That evolved into ensuring all of my commits represented logical changes to the codebase and were as concise as possible. Later, I began placing extra emphasis on clear and reproducible testing instructions.</p>

<p>I still believe all of these pursuits are important, but leaving comments on my own pull requests is the newest addition.</p>

<p>First, I open the pull request (or a draft pull request—if that feature is available to you). Immediately after, I scan through the changes and proactively annotate important lines with comments. The comments aim to direct the reviewer’s attention to areas of the code I think would benefit from direct engagement. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calling attention to a tradeoff I made</li>
  <li>Elaborating on a not so obvious change in the change set</li>
  <li>Self-identifying an area where I wasn’t 100% certain about the approach I took</li>
  <li>Explaining a concept I don’t think my reviewer has been exposed to yet</li>
</ul>

<p>While a lot of these issues can be covered in the pull request body, I find that associating the details directly with the relevant lines of code is far more inviting to reviewers. Now, instead of trying to guess the exact changes I was uncertain about, or skipping over unfamiliar parts of the change set, the reviewer receives a clear set of prompts with supporting detail from my perspective.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-examples">Real-world examples</h2>

<p>Here, I needed a way to annotate a container image with revision relevant tags and labels. There were several different approaches to choose from, but since this process is happening in GitHub Actions, I settled on the recommended approach by <a href="https://github.com/docker/build-push-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker/build-push-action</a>.</p>

<p>It also felt important to leave a comment here because if I was reviewing this pull request and I saw the words “crazy max” strung together, it would have immediately triggered my spidey senses. No offense, Max. <img title=":laughing:" alt=":laughing:" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e9313a31fcb3d7f1a04a598afd09565f49ce4b4d/f5771/images/emoji/unicode/1f606.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>In this case, I upgraded a library in an earlier troubleshooting step. That didn’t end up resolving the issue, but after I did finally resolve it, I decided to keep the library upgrade in so that the dependencies would be up-to-date.</p>

<p>All library upgrades incur some risk. Are we both willing to agree that the risk is worthwhile here?</p>

<p>Here, I decided to proactively drop Python 3.5 support from an existing library because it was approaching end-of-life. However, when you’re a library maintainer, these types of changes can have a large impact. I wanted to draw attention to the change so that the maintainers could engage with my decision from their perspective.</p>

<p>I needed a way to supply Docker Hub credentials to a GitHub Actions workflow so that release specific container images could be published. In this case, I wasn’t the repository owner, so I couldn’t set up the credentials myself. I left this comment to provide the repository owners with as much detail as possible to help make credential set up easy.</p>

<p>Differentiating between code and pull request-level comments is a question I get asked often when discussing this technique. While it is important to strike a good balance between the two, I find myself encouraging people to worry less about answering this question and focusing more on creating pull request comments in a thoughtful way. If a reviewer reads a comment and thinks it is important enough to persist in the codebase, that’s an easy suggestion and change. Asking reviewers to request the removal of existing code comments is a heavier ask.</p>

<p>That said, here are few loose guidelines for navigating the decision-making process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your comment carries relevance beyond the lifecycle of a pull request, consider that it may benefit from being a code comment.</li>
  <li>If you’re making an <em>architecturally significant</em> decision in a pull request, then it probably warrants a separate write-up in an <a href="https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architecture Decision Record</a>.</li>
  <li>If you find yourself leaving lots of pull request comments, reflect on whether your pull request is too large, your comments are truly beneficial, or if the code itself would benefit from more clarity.</li>
</ul>

We can realistically expect that during this century, the entire solar system—planets, moons, and asteroids—will be explored by flotillas of robotic craft.<br></p><p>Will there still be a role for humans in crewed spacecraft?</p><p>There’s no denying that NASA’s new Perseverance rover speeding across the Jezero crater on Mars may miss some startling discoveries that no human geologist could reasonably overlook. But machine learning is advancing fast, as is sensor technology. In contrast, the cost gap between crewed and autonomous missions remains huge.</p><p>We believe the future of crewed spaceflight lies with privately funded adventurers like SpaceX and Blue Origin, prepared to participate in a cut-price program far riskier than western nations could impose on publicly supported projects. These ventures—bringing a Silicon-Valley-type culture into a domain long-dominated by NASA and a few aerospace conglomerates—have innovated and improved rocketry far faster than NASA or the European Space Agency have done. The future role of the national agencies will be attenuated—becoming more akin to an airport rather than to an airline.</p><blockquote><p>We are near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is just beginning.</p> </blockquote><p>We would argue that inspirationally led private companies should front all missions involving humans as cut-price high-risk ventures. There would still be many volunteers—a few perhaps even accepting one-way tickets—driven by the same motives as early explorers and mountaineers. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. If that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle were. These exploits must be sold as dangerous, extreme sports, or intrepid exploration.<br></p><p>The most crucial impediment to space flight stems from the intrinsic inefficiency of chemical fuel, and the requirement to carry a weight of fuel far exceeding that of the payload. So long as we are dependent on chemical fuels, interplanetary travel will remain a challenge. Nuclear power could be transformative. Allowing much higher in-course speeds would drastically cut the transit times in the solar system, reducing not only astronauts’ boredom, but their exposure to damaging radiation. It’s more efficient if the fuel supply can be on the ground; for instance, propelling spacecraft into orbit via a “space elevator”—and then using a “star-shot”-type laser beam generated on Earth to push on a “sail” attached to the spacecraft.</p><p>By 2100, thrill seekers in the mold of Felix Baumgartner (the Austrian skydiver who in 2012 broke the sound barrier in free fall from a high-altitude balloon) may have established bases on Mars, or maybe even on asteroids. Elon Musk has said he wants to die on Mars—“but not on impact.” It’s a realistic goal, and an alluring one to some.</p><p>But don’t expect mass emigration from Earth. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth’s problems. We’ve got to solve those here. Coping with climate change or the COVID-19 pandemic may seem daunting, but it’s a piece of cake compared to terraforming Mars. There’s no place in our solar system that offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Mount Everest. Simply put, there’s no Planet B for ordinary risk-averse people.</p><p>Still, we (and our progeny here on Earth) should cheer on the brave space adventurers. They have a pivotal role to play in spearheading the post-human future and determining what happens in the 22nd century and beyond.</p><p><span>P</span>ioneer explorers will be ill-adapted to their new habitat, so they will have a compelling incentive to re-design themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed in coming decades. This might be the first step toward divergence into a new species.</p><p>Organic creatures need a planetary surface environment on which life could emerge and evolve. But if post-humans make the transition to fully inorganic intelligence, they won’t need an atmosphere. They may even prefer zero-gravity, especially for constructing massive artifacts. It’s in deep space that non-biological brains may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine.</p><p>There are chemical and metabolic limits to the size and processing power of organic brains. Maybe we are close to these limits already. But no such limits apply to or constrain electronic computers (still less, perhaps, quantum computers). So, by any definition of “thinking,” the amount and intensity that can be achieved by organic human-type brains will be swamped by the cerebrations of AI.</p><p>We are perhaps near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is only just beginning. It may happen fastest away from Earth—we wouldn’t expect (and certainly wouldn’t wish for) such rapid changes in humanity here on the Earth, though our survival may depend on ensuring the AI on Earth remains “benevolent.”</p><figure data-alt=" Livio_BREAKER-3"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18200_33ec1f50197cc4f74b3e8dc359ec3280.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>SPACE TOURISM:</strong> Private space companies should avoid the phrase “space tourism,” write Martin Ress and Mario Livio. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. They’re more like extreme sports.</span><span>NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span></figcaption></figure><p>Few doubt machines will gradually surpass or enhance more and more of our distinctively human capabilities. Disagreements are only about the timescale on which this will happen. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil says it will be just a matter of a few decades. More cautious scientists envisage centuries. Either way, the timescales for technological advances are an instant compared to the timescales of the Darwinian evolution that led to humanity’s emergence—and more relevantly, less than a millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time ahead. The products of future technological evolution could surpass humans by as much as we have surpassed slime mold.<br></p><p>But, you may wonder, what about consciousness?</p><p>Philosophers and computer scientists debate whether consciousness is something that characterizes only the type of wet, organic brains possessed by humans, apes, and dogs. Would electronic intelligences, even if their intellects would seem superhuman, lack self-awareness? The ability to imagine things that do not exist? An inner life? Or is consciousness an emergent property that any sufficiently complex network will eventually possess? Some say it’s irrelevant and semantic, like asking whether submarines can swim.</p><blockquote><p>Extraterrestrial civilization might consist of a swarm of microscopic probes that could have evaded notice.</p> </blockquote><p>We don’t think it is. If the machines are what computer scientists refer to as “zombies,” we would not accord their experiences the same value as ours, and the post-human future would seem rather bleak. On the other hand, if they are conscious, we should welcome the prospect of their future hegemony.<br></p><p>What will their guiding motivation be if they become fully autonomous entities? We have to admit we have absolutely no idea. Think of the variety of bizarre motives (ideological, financial, political, egotistical, and religious) that have driven human endeavors in the past. Here’s one simple example of how different they could be from our naive expectations: They could be contemplative. Even less obtrusively, they may realize it’s easier to think at low temperatures, therefore getting far away from any star, or even hibernating for billions of years until the cosmic microwave background cooled down far below its current 3 degrees Kelvin. At the other edge of the spectrum, they could be expansionist, which seems to be the expectation of most who’ve thought about the future trajectory of civilizations.</p><p>Even if life had originated only on Earth, it need not remain a marginal, trivial feature of the cosmos. Humans could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever-more complex intelligence spreads through the galaxy, transcending our limitations. The “sphere of influence” (or some would envisage a “frontier of conquest”) could encompass the entire galaxy, spreading via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA or instructions for 3-D printers. The leap to neighboring stars is just an early step …</p></div></div>

			<p><span>E</span>veryone seems to be talking about the problems with physics: Peter Woit’s book <i>Not Even Wrong</i>, Lee Smolin’s <i>The Trouble With Physics</i>, and Sabine Hossenfelder’s <i>Lost in Math</i> leap to mind, and they have started a wider conversation. But is all of physics really in trouble, or just some of it? If you actually read these books, you’ll see they’re about so-called “fundamental” physics. Some other parts of physics are doing just fine, and I want to tell you about one. It’s called “condensed matter physics,” and it’s the study of solids and liquids. We are living in the golden age of condensed matter physics.</p><p>But first, what is “fundamental” physics? It’s a tricky term. You might think any truly revolutionary development in physics counts as fundamental. But in fact physicists use this term in a more precise, narrowly delimited way. One of the goals of physics is to figure out some laws that, at least in principle, we could use to predict everything that can be predicted about the physical universe. The search for these laws is fundamental physics.</p><blockquote><p>There is still plenty of mind-blowing new physics being done.</p> </blockquote><p>The fine print is crucial. First: “in principle.” In principle we can use the fundamental physics we know to calculate the boiling point of water to immense accuracy—but nobody has done it yet, because the calculation is hard. Second: “everything that can be predicted.” As far we can tell, quantum mechanics says there’s inherent randomness in things, which makes some predictions <i>impossible</i>, not just impractical, to carry out with certainty. And this inherent quantum randomness sometimes gets amplified over time, by a phenomenon called chaos. For this reason, even if we knew everything about the universe now, we couldn’t predict the weather precisely a year from now. So, even if fundamental physics succeeded perfectly, it would be far from giving the answer to all our questions about the physical world. But it’s important nonetheless, because it gives us the basic framework in which we can try to answer these questions.<br></p><p><span>A</span>s of now, research in fundamental physics has given us the Standard Model (which seeks to describe matter and all the forces <i>except</i> gravity) and General Relativity (which describes gravity). These theories are tremendously successful, but we know they are not the last word. Big questions remain unanswered—like the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/48/chaos/the-physicist-who-denies-dark-matter" target="_blank">nature of dark matter</a>, or whatever is fooling us into thinking there’s dark matter. Unfortunately, progress on these questions has been very slow since the 1990s. Luckily fundamental physics is not all of physics, and today it is no longer the most exciting part of physics. There is still plenty of mind-blowing new physics being done. And a lot of it—though by no means all—is condensed matter physics.</p><p>Traditionally, the job of condensed matter physics was to predict the properties of solids and liquids found in nature. Sometimes this can be very hard: for example, computing the boiling point of water. But now we know enough fundamental physics to design strange new materials—and then actually <i>make</i> these materials, and probe their properties with experiments, testing our theories of how they should work. Even better, these experiments can often be done on a table top. There’s no need for <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/who-really-found-the-higgs-boson" target="_blank">enormous particle accelerators</a> here.</p><div>

</div><p>Let’s look at an example. We’ll start with the humble “hole.” A crystal is a regular array of atoms, each with some electrons orbiting it. When one of these electrons gets knocked off somehow, we get a “hole”: an atom with a missing electron. And this hole can actually move around like a particle! When an electron from some neighboring atom moves to fill the hole, the hole moves to the neighboring atom. Imagine a line of people all wearing hats except for one whose head is bare: If their neighbor lends them their hat, the bare head moves to the neighbor. If this keeps happening, the bare head will move down the line of people. The absence of a thing can act like a thing!<br></p><p>The famous physicist Paul Dirac came up with the idea of holes in 1930. He correctly predicted that since electrons have negative electric charge, holes should have positive charge. Dirac was working on fundamental physics: He hoped the proton could be explained as a hole. That turned out not to be true. Later physicists found another particle that could: the “positron.” It’s just like an electron with the opposite charge. And thus antimatter—the evil twin of <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/is-matter-conscious" target="_blank">ordinary matter</a>, with the same mass but the opposite charge—was born. (But that’s another story.)</p><blockquote><p>We now live in the era of “designer matter.”</p> </blockquote><p>In 1931, Werner Heisenberg applied the idea of holes to condensed matter physics. He realized that, just as electrons create an electrical current as they move along, so do holes—but because they’re positively charged, their electrical current goes in the other direction! It became clear that holes carry electrical current in some of the materials called “semiconductors”: for example, silicon with a bit of aluminum added to it. After many further developments, in 1948 the physicist William Schockley patented transistors that use both holes and electrons to form a kind of switch. He later won the Nobel Prize for this, and now they’re widely used in computer chips.<br></p><p>Holes in semiconductors are not really particles in the sense of fundamental physics. They are just a convenient way of thinking about the motion of electrons. But any sufficiently convenient abstraction takes on a life of its own. The equations that describe the behavior of holes are just like the equations that describe the behavior of particles. So, we can treat holes <i>as if</i> they are particles. We’ve already seen that a hole is positively charged. But because it takes energy to get a hole moving, a hole also <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/54/the-unspoken/physics-has-demoted-mass" target="_blank">acts like it has a mass</a>. And so on: The properties we normally attribute to particles also make sense for holes.</p><p>Physicists have a name for things that act like particles even though they’re not: “quasiparticles.” There are many kinds; holes are just one of the simplest. The beauty of quasiparticles is that we can practically make them to order, having a vast variety of properties. As the quantum physicist Michael Nielsen put it, we now live in the era of “designer matter.”</p><p>For example, consider the “exciton.” Since an electron is negatively charged and a hole is positively charged, they attract each other. And if the hole is much heavier than the electron—remember, a hole has a mass—an electron can orbit a hole much as an electron orbits a proton in a hydrogen atom. Thus, they form a kind of artificial atom called an exciton. It’s a ghostly dance of presence and absence!</p><figure data-alt="Baez_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18201_23038c01c7e628d1eec505640a5a8472.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>OPPOSITES ATTRACT:</strong> This is how an exciton, the binding together of a positively charged “hole” and an electron, moves inside a crystal lattice.</span><span>Wikipedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>The idea of excitons goes back all the way to 1931. By now we can make excitons in large quantities in certain semiconductors and other materials. They don’t last for long: The electron quickly falls back into the hole. It often takes less than a billionth of a second for this to happen. But that’s enough time to do some interesting things. Just as two atoms of hydrogen can stick together and form a molecule, two excitons can stick together and form a “biexciton.” An exciton can stick to another hole and form a “trion.” An exciton can even stick to a <i>photon</i>—a particle of light—and form something called a “polariton.” It’s a blend of matter and light!<br></p><p>Can you make a gas of artificial atoms? Yes! At low densities and high temperatures, excitons zip around very much like atoms in a gas. Can you make a liquid? Again, yes: At higher densities, and colder temperatures, excitons bump into each other enough to act like a liquid. At even colder temperatures, excitons can even form a “superfluid,” with almost zero viscosity: if you could somehow get it swirling around, it would go on practically forever.</p><p>This is just a small taste of what researchers in condensed matter physics are doing these days. Besides excitons, they are studying a host of other quasiparticles. A “phonon” is a quasiparticle of sound formed from vibrations moving through a crystal. A “magnon” is a quasiparticle of magnetization: a pulse of electrons in a crystal whose spins have flipped. The list goes on, and becomes ever more esoteric.</p><p>But there is also much more to the field than quasiparticles. Physicists can now create materials in which the speed of light is much slower than usual, say 40 miles an hour. They can even create materials in which light moves as if there were two space dimensions and two time dimensions, instead of the usual three dimensions of space and one of time! Normally we think that time can go forward in just one direction, but in these substances light has a choice between many different directions it can go “forward in time.” On the other hand, its motion in <i>space</i> is confined to a plane.</p><p>In short, the possibilities of condensed matter are limited only by our imagination and the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/71/flow/why-beauty-is-fatal-to-physics" target="_blank">fundamental laws of physics</a>.</p><p><span>A</span>t this point, usually some skeptic comes along and questions whether these things are useful. Indeed, some of these new materials are likely to be <i>useful</i>. In fact a lot of condensed matter physics, while less glamorous than what I have just described, is carried out precisely to develop new improved computer chips—and also technologies like “photonics,” which uses light instead of electrons. The fruits of photonics are ubiquitous—it saturates modern technology, like flat-screen TVs—but physicists are now aiming for more radical applications, like computers that process information using light.</p><p>Then …</p></div></div>

When running processes on Unix systems,
it is important that every process be waited-on by its parent process.
<p>
Processes (such as "daemons") should not be run in "the background",
orphaned and reparented to init,
such that nothing will be notified if they exit.
</p><p>
Instead, they should be run under some other program, perhaps a process supervisor, which will wait on them;
much has been
<a href="https://jdebp.uk/FGA/unix-daemon-design-mistakes-to-avoid.html">written about</a>
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/daemon.html">this before.</a>
</p><p>
This is absolutely true and correct,
and any system that is starting up processes in "the background" and just letting them leak
is fundamentally flawed and must be fixed;
and a dedicated process supervisor, running as a daemon, is a good way to approach fixing such problems.
</p><p>
But ultimately, the dedicated process supervisor daemon isn't necessary.
</p><p>
Starting and waiting on child processes is something any Unix program can do.
There's no need for a specialized process supervision daemon.
</p><p>
If I have a collection of processes which together provide some functionality or application,
it's natural for me to start those processes as my own child processes,
and then wait on them and implement my own failure-handling policies
based on the domain-specific information that I have about their behavior.
</p><p>
With this approach,
I start the child processes that are relevant to me and then <em>keep running</em>,
waiting on those child processes and performing any maintenance tasks necessary (such as restarting failed processes).
</p><p>
This is a naturally recursive structure,
where a given process might spawn more child processes to perform its task,
each of which might in turn spawn still more child processes.
</p><p>
This recursive structure ultimately bottoms out at the init process - systemd or something else.
</p><p>
With systemd, a weak form of this recursive structure is always the case:
The "system instance" of systemd (which is the init process)
starts and waits on a "user instance" of systemd for each interactive user;
the user instance in turn runs and waits on various user processes, such as a desktop environment.
</p><p>
But systemd only allows for two levels of recursion: system, then user.
There's no way to start a systemd instance that just manages a single user application,
with a lifecycle tied to that single application.
</p><p>
The best way to achieve further such recursion is to simply write a regular Unix program
which just starts its own child processes and waits on them.
</p><p>
Indeed, this is already how most applications which run child processes work.
They don't delegate the core Unix primitive of "fork and exec" to some system service;
they simply perform it themselves.
</p><p>
Many designs are much easier when starting one's own child processes.
If I want to connect two processes with a socketpair,
the simple and obvious way is to create the socketpair, then start the two processes,
so that they inherit the file descriptors.
If I want to start some processes in the same set of namespaces,
similarly the easiest way is to just enter those namespaces and then start the processes.
And, of course, if I want to handle process failure with more intelligence than "restart it 5 times",
it's easy to implement that logic in a general purpose programming language.
</p><p>
Delegating this basic functionality to a separate service like systemd provides little benefit,
if one is careful to monitor one's own child processes.
</p><p>
With modern programming languages and <a href="https://github.com/catern/rsyscall">libraries</a>,
it's easier than ever to write Unix programs which start and wait on collections of processes.
</p><p>
When building your next multi-process system,
consider starting and monitoring processes directly,
instead of using a process supervisor.
</p><p>
It can make sophisticated designs much easier,
and also combines well with <a href="http://catern.com/distsys.html">richly typed designs</a>.

<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>

<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>

<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name="i" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0"&gt;FizzBuzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 3 = 0"&gt;Fizz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 5 = 0"&gt;Buzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$i" /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="$i &amp;lt; 100"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="$i + 1" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, I decided to bolster my security this year, and invest in a YubiKey. One of its less obvious features is OpenPGP support; this means as well as U2F and TOPT authentication, you can use it for all kinds of cryptographic possibilities. Those familiar with SmartCards will probably already be familiar with what they can do, and that is the important point. The YubiKey is also an OpenPGP Smartcard.</p>

<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>If you're time poor, you <em>might</em> not have time to set up PGP properly, so as a first step consider using Signal and ProtonMail (they are both secure and free). At least then you can be confident you are set up to communicate via encrypted channels.</p>

<p>Your motivation to set up PGP keys will most likely depend on need such as being a journalist, wanting to sign your code or perhaps you are just a curious geek. It seems today few people are using PGP encrypted e-mail, and of those that are, probably most are using services like ProtonMail which is a good step, but doesn't let you use your own master key without uploading it*, which complicates things if you require the <strong>highest</strong> level of security.</p>

<p>* <a href="https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-is-the-private-key-stored/" rel="nofollow">It will be stored encrypted with your password though</a>. So they never have access to it. Keeping your certification key off the internet entirely is possibly overkill for most users.</p>

<p>That being said – I think if you are willing to try, the more private communications there are in the wild, the less they stick out – so you help to mitigate mass surveillance operations, and you have secure channels of communication ready, should the need ever arise (which often becomes much more difficult to do safely / legally, if that day comes).</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>PGP allows you to sign, encrypt and authenticate (and certify) basically anything. This covers numerous activities such as:</p>
<ul><li>encrypting / decrypting messages such as emails</li>
<li>signing git commits &amp; software releases</li>
<li>authenticating via SSH</li>
<li>proving that all of the above were done by you</li></ul>

<p>To get the full benefit of PGP, you need to keep your master key safe – as if that is compromised, you lose nearly all the benefits of using it in the first place. Obviously the greater your personal need for operations security, the higher the risks of somebody targeting your key. The PGP system was designed to easily protect your information, even from threats like nation states, so much of the advice you will see on PGP is uncompromising – and is focused on how to <strong>maximise</strong> security.</p>

<p>In practice, few of us are in need of Edward Snowden levels of security – although if your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security" rel="nofollow"><em>opsec</em></a> is strong (especially for journalists), you might be more likely to have a high security source trust you with their leaks or tips.</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-master-key">Generating a Master Key</h2>

<p>Already we are faced here with options, and I think this is what puts off most people right from the start. You really need to use the command line, decide what key length (and algorithm) you are going to use, and decide where you are going to generate your key.</p>

<p>I chose to generate a 4096-bit RSA key.</p>

<p>The main options are:</p>
<ul><li>Just using your current machine
<ul><li>This is the easiest, but is also the least secure, as a compromised machine could leak your key to the world</li></ul></li>
<li>Directly on SmartCard / YubiKey
<ul><li>This is simple and secure (as long as nobody can hack your key)</li>
<li>Even you cannot remove the master key from your YubiKey, and risk losing access</li></ul></li>
<li>Using an offline system
<ul><li>This involves having a live operating system from something like a USB drive, and while you might upgrade stuff using the internet, or install tools to manage your YubiKey, you pull the internet cable before generating your key, and you shut down the machine without internet when complete.</li></ul></li>
<li>Offline system in an air-gapped room
<ul><li>This is the Snowden level option, if you think that you are being targeted by the most advanced capabilities, then you would literally need to scrub a room (that functions as a faraday cage) of all electronics, and probably better using a single write medium with no electronic components like a DVD-R for the live operating system, and you would need to leave your phone out of this room, and then you should probably destroy and scrub everything after generating the key, and even then you would need to be careful to encrypt your messages in a similarly safe environment if possible, because frankly at this point people are potentially trying to hack you, add keyloggers, and find easier ways of breaking your encryption than actually having to decrypt your messages. Which you will never 100% guarantee they won't be able to do, as the three letter agency types of the world would not tell you if they could – although the strongest available encryption is the best you've got, and it probably will work.</li>
<li>I mostly add this option as a joke, because obviously organisations like the NSA and GCHQ have this sort of practice baked into their offices along with all the physical security etc. so even if you were to try this at home, without the resources to manage this level of security – you would probably fall down somewhere, but we can all dream right!?
<br></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>I opted for the offline system, and ran into a few problems, such as my laptops WiFi card not being supported by the stock Debian live USB, and my other machine (which has cabled LAN) didn't have USB-C ports (which my YubiKey does). In the end I bought a USB-C (f) –&gt; USB A adapter and used the LAN. This worked well, and I was able to get the packages I needed, pull the LAN cable, and then generate my key following <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>.</p>

<p><em>The important thing is that the instructions are really precise and often if you get a step wrong, you will need to start from scratch.</em></p>

<p>I then loaded up my laptop and (having made a USB key with an encrypted partition with private keys and revocation certificate, and an un-encrypted partition with the public key, as per the guide), tried to load my public key onto my machine, so I could start using my YubiKey – which had the signing, encryption and authentication keys loaded onto it now. Sadly my public key partition didn't mount and I had already shut-down the offline system so I had to load the live disk back up install some packages again and pull the LAN cable, and then load up my encrypted partition (which did mount), and restore my keys – this is the only copy of the master key, emergency revocation key and public key – so losing that would have meant starting from scratch. Once I had fixed my issues with the backup USB key, I was able to restore my public key to my laptop, and continue.</p>

<h2 id="backing-it-up">Backing it up</h2>

<p>Now, I had so far neglected to make any other backup of my keys other than the encrypted USB stick, and bit-rot is a genuine risk, so I also wanted to make physical backups – and so I used a tool <code>paperkey</code> to print them using my live USB, and restoring keys from the encrypted USB, and obviously this time I also needed to install printer drivers and things. Technically printers are a risk too, so for the ultra-paranoid you might want to either not have a backup and risk getting locked out of your own keys, or find some more reliable medium. For convenience I would have backed up my master key with a QR code tool, however the 4096 bit RSA key I generated was too big to QR – so for that I would have OCR scan it to revive the key.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-key">Using the key</h2>

<p>The first thing I did was submit my public key to a few <code>keyservers</code> which enables other users to trivially discover my public key, which is all they need to send me encrypted messages – and importantly means if I for some reason lose it, I can download it again myself. I then followed some examples of encrypting messages to myself, and decrypting them on the command line – just to try it. That all worked well.</p>

<p>I was initially excited to try and use my keys with ProtonMail, which has full PGP support and is my current e-mail provider, only to discover that it would require that I upload my private key the way it currently works – so I just had to leave it in a situation where I have different public keys for my email accounts in ProtonMail, and I don't really want to leave the service – but I was frustrated that I couldn't use it.</p>

<p>I then also got excited about Social Proofs (which is a mixture between actually verifying ownership of various accounts, and stamp collecting). I tried keybase.io – it worked, and while it did ask me to optionally upload my private key, it was able to do all the “proofs”, with me signing the actions on my local machine. The purchase of Keybase by Zoom however put me off, and various practices like mounting drives and adding stuff to startup made me remove KeyBase entirely from my system – unfortunately they just don't seem to have managed to maintain trust, respect and sufficient usage for their (originally noble goals) to pan out in the long run. I did like their idea though.</p>

<p>Next I tried a distributed social proof tool called KeyOxide – <a href="https://keyoxide.org/1AFD9615CAB90BE7" rel="nofollow">here are my proofs</a> (should you wish to contact me). KeyOxide is less automated than Keybase, doesn't have file sharing and private messaging, but it also doesn't need you to create an account or upload anything, doesn't need apps, and its proof system works well.</p>

<p>Of course, social proofs and identities matched to your cryptographic identity are not for people flying under the radar – but it is a mistake that cryptography is only for those people. I'm happy that I have a way to prove that I am who I say I am online, and therefore disavow any attempts to impersonate me.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-commit-signing">Setting up commit signing</h2>

<p>Signing commits is pretty easy, and simply requires that you point <code>git</code> to a public key file, and tell it to sign all commits in the config. Then you'll need your YubiKey to commit anything, which will also prompt you for a pin unlock the first time each session (if you don't want that, pull the YubiKey after each commit). Then you just need to upload your commit on Github, and hey-presto, all your commits show as signed and verified.</p>

<h2 id="ssh">SSH</h2>

<p>So now you have a YubiKey set up with PGP keys, and therefore you can use it for SSH. You will …</p></div></div>

	The Cape Maclear Initiative is a USD 3.5 billion initiative to be developed within a tailored made special economic zone featuring the following two key components: (1) <strong>Cape Maclear Resort City, </strong>a USD 2 billion development cluster featuring a touristic resort destination and an exclusive 50-year concession for regional finance, business, and trading free zone, to be developed over three phases and (2) <strong>Cape Maclear Airport City, </strong>a USD 1.5 billion development featuring Cape Maclear International Airport and Cape Maclear Logistics Park. Morningside is the lead partner of one of its key development management affiliates, AE7 Development Management Africa ltd. (ADMA) which has sourced the opportunity and developed the project brief, the high-level business plan in addition to preparing a strategic vision document that became the basis of negotiations with the Government of Malawi. To secure a special economic zone status, various concessions for airport, logistics park, and a regional business hub free benefiting from a unique package of investment protection and fiscal incentives. ADMA has managed the masterplan design concept developed by global design firm AE7. The ADMA consortium also includes Ernie Els Group, and other leading regional and global providers. Current focus is on securing funding for the first phase of the Cape Maclear Initiative from local, regional and global investors.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Today we'll continue our voyage into the graphics subsystem components.</p>

<p>The question we'll try to answer is what kind of communications occur between the GuC and the rest of the system. In this post we'll look at firmware components and next post at Windows components.</p>

<p>For a reminder what the GuC is, look at <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/10/graphics-part1.html">part1 post</a> .</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>The Intel Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) EFI DXE driver can be extracted in various versions from many UEFI capsules available through many vendors.
For this post I redid my original analysis on a recent version from a CanonLake system.</p>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to try and see whether the GOP driver communicates with the GuC over the PCIe bus (TL;dr: it doesn't)</p>

<p>The binary isn't to large - 84KB, so we can try to completely reverse engineer it. I used both IDA+HexRays and a dynamic analysis UEFI emulator I developed for just these cases. The emulator lets you run EFI DXE drivers in Windows simulating many UEFI services and allowing me to modify/inspect EFI interfaces, hook UEFI protocol structs, and even has some fuzzing capabilities.</p>

<p>Looking at the driver's entrypoint we see it stores the different service tables in globals and then jumps to the main() functions I called GopEntryPoint().</p>

<p>The second part does the actual work. First it looks for the EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL to setup a the unload routine:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>gDRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL</span><span>.</span><span>Version</span> <span>=</span> <span>v18</span> <span>+</span> <span>v19</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then install four protocol handlers, three of which I identified: one for driver binding and two for component name handling. The InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces(..) can accept multiple protocols, each protocol has a GUID and the “virtual table” like structure used by UEFI. The final entry is NULL. Most UEFI protocol GUIDs are public (and appear in the EDK) so we can identify them easily and this identify the virtual table structures associated with them, for example for the UEFI binding protocol we have in DriverBinding.h:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL_GUID \

      <article role="main">
          <p>In May 2020, in the early stages of the pandemic, IT outlets drew attention of their readers with headlines such as <a href="https://www.lrz.de/presse/ereignisse/2020-06-03_InterviewSecurityIncident/">“Supercomputeres offline across Europe”</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/hackers-target-european-supercomputers-researching-covid-19">“Hackers Target European Supercomputers Researching Covid-19”</a> or in contrast to that <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/05/11-plus-supercomputers-hacked-with-cryptominers-by-china/">“11-Plus Supercomputers Hacked With Cryptominers”</a>. Apparently, at that time, some supercomputers went offline citing security reasons, but no one really knew why. To put speculations aside, we want to dedicate this blog post to a brief retrospective of what insiders only know as <em>the HPC incident</em> coupled with a forensic deep-dive from one of the affected institutions.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a clarification: A so-called  <em>supercomputer</em> is really just a sizeable bunch of ordinary computers tied together to form a single large system that is then used by scientists around the globe to perform computation-heavy tasks. To put that into perspective: While the number of physical CPU cores in a typical desktop or laptop computer in 2020 varies between two and eight, <em>HPC</em> (<em>H</em>igh <em>P</em>erformance <em>C</em>omputing) systems are made up of thousands of single computer systems with typically more than 20 cores each (forming a <em>cluster</em>). To name a random example from the current HPC Top 10 list, the <em>HPC5</em> cluster in Eni (Italy) is composed of 3,640 servers, each equipped with 24 physical CPU and four GPU cores, resulting in a total of 87,360 CPUs and 7,280 GPUs. Typical workloads for such HPC systems are medical research, seismic imaging or weather and climate modeling.</p>

<p>The difficulty in programming for such HPC systems stems from the requirement to divide workloads into a lot of small chunks that can then be distributed amongst these computers (often just called <em>nodes</em>) and executed in parallel. Since building and operating a cluster like that is obviously quite expensive, their owners try to maximize utilization of the available computing capacity by permitting concurrent access to selected researchers from all around the globe.</p>

<p>From a security perspective, this implies that HPC systems need to be generally accessible from anywhere (specifically the dangerous Internet) and therefore demand suitable authentication and authorization mechanisms so that only permitted parties have access and also won’t interfere with each other. On the other hand, restricting HPC users or workloads too much isn’t desired either. After all, the intended purpose of HPC clusters is to provide scientists easy access to a flexible platform that they can perform their research on - which often requires compromises security-wise. For instance, cluster nodes often don’t receive security fixes immediately. Instead, software updates have to be planned and tested in advance together with the cluster’s manufacturer and are scheduled only after no issues occurred during testing. Since in HPC availability is key, flawless interaction of all involved components has to be guaranteed prior to software changes. In our case, proprietary drivers for specialized hardware such as InfiniBand network controllers require even more attention and have to be re-certified with each update. Consequently, updates are often delayed and bundled together with others to reduce overall cluster downtime.</p>

<p>Having said that, the headlines mentioned earlier reporting an unscheduled downtime (in fact, for several weeks) were a clear indication that something serious must have been wrong at the time. Upon closer inspection, we discover a prime example of an <em>Advanced Persistent Threat</em> (APT), a term that depicts a “threat actor, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period” according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">Wikipedia</a> and has been occupying the security research community for decades. In the following sections, we’ll try to reconstruct the events surrounding this incident from our own perspective as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team">CERT</a> of one of Germany’s affected national universities. But first, let’s have a look at the general architecture of our own HPC cluster (which isn’t much different from others) and how researchers interact with it.</p>

<h2 id="the-victim-still-in-good-health">The victim, still in good health</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.educv.de/img/blog-2021-02-17/architecture.png" alt="Cluster architecture"></p>

<p>From a bird’s-eye perspective, everything in our HPC cluster is centered around a large array of <em>compute nodes</em>, which is where the actual computation-heavy research tasks are executed. Since such computations are typically performed on large amounts of data (such as the raw dataset resulting from an experiment) and distributed among a lot of compute nodes, shared network storage and accompanying fast (high throughput, low latency) network connections are a necessity. In the HPC world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand">InfiniBand</a> has been established as the de-facto standard for the physical interconnects, while there are different technologies available for the storage part, such as NFS and Lustre. In fact, many HPC systems utilize multiple filesystems for network storage depending on requirements (smaller, but fast short-term storage during computation vs. slow, but large long-time storage).</p>

<p>Permitted HPC users interact with our cluster by logging into one of the <em>login nodes</em> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)">SSH</a>, which allows them to access the shared storage and to interact with the <em>job scheduler</em>, a sort of reservation system that schedules and distributes the research <em>jobs</em> among the available compute nodes and tries to ensure that the different jobs don’t interfere with each other. In our case the login nodes weren’t accessible from all over the Internet. Instead, access was limited to our campus network as well as selected partner universities and other collaborating institutions. Our <em>export nodes</em> were different: Since most HPC jobs require huge amounts of raw data to be copied over to our shared storage, these nodes could be accessed directly from anywhere to offer optimal bandwidth and not disrupt our VPN. As a security measure and in contrast to the login systems, access to the export nodes is restricted to file operations. They don’t provide their users with a shell to execute arbitrary commands and are therefore deemed at lower risk.</p>

<p>Lastly, the cluster setup contains management infrastructure that offers various services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">LDAP</a> for user authentication or the <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">SLURM Workload Manager</a>, which is our job scheduler. Administrative systems are also used by the HPC team as well as the vendor of the cluster for all kinds of management purposes, such as setting up new compute nodes, scheduling updates or inspecting issues during cluster operation. Obviously, regular HPC users are not allowed to access these systems.</p>

<p>Regarding operating systems, all nodes within our HPC infrastructure run Linux, more specifically the <em>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</em> (RHEL) distribution. To fully understand the technical details within the rest of this article, some basic Linux knowledge is beneficial.</p>

<h2 id="wounded">Wounded</h2>

<p>On a fateful day in early May 2020, with the cluster happily chugging along, our HPC team was informed by a partner that a cluster from another university had spotted suspicious system modifications, which were in turn also discovered at various other HPC institutions throughout the country. More specifically, our initial report briefly mentioned <em>“files in <code>/etc/fonts</code>“</em> and - in some cases - compromised SSH binaries, which are utilized by users to connect to third party HPC systems. Alerted, our HPC guys immediately started to assess the cluster, looking for similar IoCs (<em>I</em>ndicators <em>o</em>f <em>C</em>ompromise) as the ones reported. It didn’t take long to verify that, indeed, we could confirm similar peculiarities. On some nodes, the directory <code>/etc/fonts</code> looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la /etc/fonts
drwxr-xr-x.   3 root root    4096 Feb 20 01:31 .
drwxr-xr-x. 128 root root   12288 May 13 18:10 ..
-rwsr-sr-x    1 root root    8616 Feb 24  2017 .fonts
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root 200046 20144 Feb 24  2017 .low
drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    4096 Feb 20 01:31 conf.d
-rw-r--r--    1 root root    2416 Jun  8  2018 fonts.conf
</code></pre>

<p>The two executable files <code>.fonts</code>  and <code>.low</code> clearly didn’t belong there. The timestamp indicates that they were last modified in 2017, which would have been horrible due to the cluster being potentially compromised since then, but that value is also very easy to forge and shouldn’t be trusted at all. Of greater concern were the file’s permissions, which are shown in the left-most column. For <code>.fonts</code>, the <code>s</code> in the permission map <code>-rwsr-sr-x</code> essentially mean that any user who executes that program automatically runs it as if he were the user with the highest privilege level, namely <code>root</code>. We later executed those files in a safe sandboxed environment, just to confirm the worst-case assumption that this file is a plain and simple backdoor that allows <em>ANY</em> user to immediately gain administrative rights on the system:</p>

<pre><code>$ whoami
user123
$ /etc/fonts/.fonts
$ whoami
root
</code></pre>

<p>Later on, more thorough analyses such as <a href="https://atdotde.blogspot.com/2020/05/high-performance-hackers.html">this</a> confirmed that behaviour and also shone light on the purpose of the other executable, <code>.low</code>. It’s essentially a log wiping tool that attempts to remove all traces of a user’s activity from the system’s log files. Having found those, the maliciousness of the reported observations weren’t in question anymore. For us, the situation was especially dire due to the fact that not only the user-facing login, compute and export nodes were found compromised, but also various administrative machines, which offered an attacker essentially full control over the entire HPC cluster. The reaction of our HPC team was swift and similar to other affected institutions: The whole cluster was disconnected from the Internet, leading to the sudden downtimes that were reported in the news. What followed was a collaborative effort coordinated by the <em>Gauss Centre for Supercomputing</em>, the <em>Gauss Alliance</em> in Germany and EU-wide association <em>PRACE</em> to share further IoCs and preliminary forensic results. Meanwhile, federal authorities also undertook a criminal investigation into the potential motives and suspects of this incident.</p>

<p>It is the beginning of 2021, after an year of changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever we see the importance of global connectivity and communication. In an year of restrictions and isolation and in a hard time of changed priorities we had just the right tools, solutions and infrastructure to not separate ourselves but to stay connected. And as challenging times do happen every once in a while this time we kept more together than ever. </p>



<p>People working from home saving any bit of economics that can go on, kids and student taking virtual classrooms, all the dynamic information sharing and all this possible over a global network, truly showing that we might not live in a world of boundaries. This is an evolution made possible through a combined effort of now decades of work in IT and Telecommunications. Yet seeing this prove of all this hard work, all we know is that the Internet connects us and has become itself a large ‘organism’ of connected networks and devices. But how do we care for it?</p>



<h2>How do we proof our future</h2>



<p>To go straight to the topic, the Internet as large as it has grown has the pains of it’s own. Bringing people together, moving the office, the classroom, a conference or just a family gathering online has once again increased the number of users and connected devices. And this number of connected devices is already causing troubles – numbering, specifically the IPv4 addressing is long lasting trouble in this world of “no boundaries”. So IPv6 should be coming to save the day, right.</p>



<h2>IPv4 exhaustion and how far are we with the next generation?</h2>



<p>More and more connected devices than ever, in world of less than 4 billion available IPv4 addresses. Many of you already know the IPv4 allocation are now considered exhausted. With RIPE NCC reporting the end of the available allocations back in November 2019, most of the RIRs have now declared lack of spare IPv4 resources. Weĺl this is still far from causing any severe effect on the global connectivity. These allocated IP addresses are in the hands of providers. RIRs have developed procedures for reclaiming unused addresses. Waiting lists for new assignments were developed and so on. Measures are taken to slow down the inevitable. </p>



<p>But at some point we have to look a bit further. How far are with deploying IPv6? It has been decades since we’ve been taught that it is the future of the Internet, but did we ever get there? Well i wouldn’t mean to be dramatic, but i feel that we’re not even working focused enough to reach this future.</p>



<p>Yesterday I’ve decided to do a little experiment – how efficiently can i use IPv6 only Internet and as interesting as it may sound, it was sort of a short adventure.</p>



<h2>Who’s there?</h2>



<p>What you can find on the IPv6 Internet has a good beginning. If you’ve been the office local sysadmin you know that first three checked by the user who reports that the “Internet is down” are Google, Facebook and YouTube. Well good news the Internet “is there” in the IPv6 world.</p>



<p>What is bit of concerning is what can you reach from the Googles search results. Not that much unfortunately. First surprise is that it looks like they plan an “ad free” Internet, several Google Ads redirects don’t have AAAA records rendering several links unreachable. Then it starts microsoft.com – no AAAA, apple.com – no, several other global companies – no IPv6 records at all.</p>



<p>On the local scope in Bulgaria (where i currently live), popular news portals and a well known free email service – not on IPv6. Four out of five main universities don’t even have AAAA records, one of the universities is fully available on v6. Not one of the three major telecoms has their website available on IPv6 although they do provide IPv6 connectivity to customers. And i guess people who know me will know which was the only hosting service provider running on IPv6, half a dozen of other popular names unreachable. I was able to find one government site functioning on IPv6. Can’t order food from popular food deliveries. Local auction portal unreachable.</p>



<p>Back on the more global scale i was surprised that i couldn’t use any popular video conferencing tool,  instant messenger and several other SaaS services i use at work.</p>



<p>Scary but there is no Stack overflow on IPv6, maybe due to the lack of github.com as well.</p>



<p>It’s a lot of popular services, that don’t have DNS records for IPv6. This is not a reachabilty issue, it is just lack of support for IPv6 at the moment.</p>



<p>I didn’t feel very comfortable on the IPv6 world, so back to the 32-bit, I am willing to share this “state of the future” with an appeal. It’s not a deadline, but we also don’t have to wait for the last moment. IPv6 is running and by far it still seems to be the future of Internet.</p>



<h2>Call for action</h2>



<p>My appeal is – if you run a service, if you host a web site try using IPv6 as well.</p>



<p>It has bit of a scarier looking addresses, but we do use DNS now, right?</p>



<p>Keep in mind that sometimes you need extra security. Don’t rely solely on it for important stuff. But still if we don’t work on a better alternative, we need to start making baby steps in this direction.</p>



<p>And I don’t consider myself anything like an expert in IPv6, but if you do have any questions, i would be glad to share whatever i can to the extent of my experience with it.</p>



<p>IPv6 is working but we don’t tend to use it, and we don’t even bother. Famous last words will be “give it a try, it can’t be that bad “, but I do believe that if have to build the foundation of our future we can’t just sit and wait.</p>



<blockquote><p>Come to the IPv6 – we… still have cookies</p></blockquote>

This particularly innovative approach brings the digital transformation in law to a new angle of reflection with a collaborative methodology involving several stakeholders (legal experts, designers, developers and especially users).</p><blockquote><p id="3ed2">In France, the year 2017 was a turning point with the emergence of a new trend that seems to be continuing and consolidating: <strong>lawyers themselves are becoming players in the field of innovation</strong>. The digital transformation of law is appearing from a new and much more <strong>collaborative angle</strong>. Law has become an object of innovation on which lawyers now work together with technical profiles in order to create new products and services with high added value.</p><p id="40dd">It is in this new context that legal design is being developed. It is an outstanding illustration which demonstrates that <strong>innovation in law is not exclusively technological</strong> but also involves rethinking the way in which law is designed. Legal design is a collaborative approach full of promises, provided it is thoroughly grasped through its subtleties and complexity.</p></blockquote><h2 id="eb6a">My experience of law as a citizen</h2><p id="e310">From my point of view, law has always been something inaccessible. Almost all of us have experienced a situation where we had to sign a document without paying too much attention to the important lines. This anxious feeling of reading incomprehensible legal paragraphs. A feeling of failure when a problem arises because we did not read the right line that contained the statement of our rights.</p><h2 id="167c">If I had to define Legal Design</h2><p id="f2b8">From my point of view as a French citizen and designer, Legal Design is an innovative discipline which reflects a new approach to law in order to make it more accessible and understandable for citizens.<br>Today, I notice that the deliverables that emerge in Legal Design projects are essentially related to legal documentation in order to make them more honest for the citizen.<br>Tomorrow, the approach will take on a new dimension by rethinking the essence of law by working on services as to optimize access to justice, particularly in its digitalization.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Legal Design, a web designer’s perspective on this new practice" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RIePeBJF7Uujxhc_.png" width="700" height="637" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*RIePeBJF7Uujxhc_.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*RIePeBJF7Uujxhc_.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*RIePeBJF7Uujxhc_.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RIePeBJF7Uujxhc_.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*RIePeBJF7Uujxhc_.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Legal Design / © Margareth Hagan</figcaption></figure><p id="08c9">Design, tech and law are three areas which collaborate with each others to achieve the best possible result.

In our daily lives, we use products, whether physical, digital or services that have been conceived by designers. For many, design is only about the visual aspect of a product. We’ve all heard the expression <em>“It’s design!”</em> as a crude expression of <em>“I think it’s beautiful!”.</em> However, it is not about what the product looks like, but more about its functionality, practicality and aesthetics.<br>In any case, it is important to remember that design is <strong>multidisciplinary</strong> and uses, among other things, methodologies and tools to <strong>solve sometimes complex problems,</strong> offering better products, services and functionalities, and above all <strong>to ask the right questions.</strong><br>In UX Design, empathy and understanding of the user’s needs are also central notions of our profession.</p><p id="c1c7">There are a wide range of methodologies related to user experience.</p><p id="4678"><strong>Created in 1980 by Rolfe Faste,</strong> Design Thinking is a non-linear methodology which consists of applying, through a collaborative process, analytical and intuitive thinking in five steps: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test.</p><p id="4349"><strong>In 1990, Donald Norman</strong> coined the term “UX Design” as a way of describing the quality of the user experience, which includes all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the business, its services and its products.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Legal Design, a web designer’s perspective on this new practice" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png" width="1000" height="707" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*MmS9w-AXVEJ70dMZ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>© AnnePedrofr — UX REPUBLIC</figcaption></figure><p id="3b33">From the beginning of a new project, several disciplines are important to consider, such as the exploration of user data (UX research), the analysis and formalization of the message we want to design (UX design), the artistic direction we will apply to the document (graphic design) or a user interface (UI) if the future product tends towards an interface.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Legal Design, a web designer’s perspective on this new practice" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5120/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*HQlRnZyRv6xPOoheBKmbMQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Our methodology that we apply at Linkvalue for our projects — © Romain Gerardin</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="0909">In our Legal Design projects, we apply this iterative methodology, taking into account all the actors in the process, i.e. designer, lawyer, developer, client and users, from exploring data to evaluation by testing the solution with the target users.<br>Throughout the project, we will start by collecting data in a qualitative and/or quantitative way through user research in order to analyze it and study the problem (the “why”) of the product / service. Then we will develop the solution which will allow us to answer it in a desired direction (the “how”). In this solution, we will work on the content (the message), the location of its content for a good readability (ergonomics) or the graphic layer that will complete its visual aspect (aesthetics).<br><strong>This is one of the cases which demonstrates the multidisciplinarity in our profession of designer.</strong></p><blockquote><p id="614d"><strong><em>A designer must first ask himself the right questions before trying to solve problems.</em></strong></p></blockquote><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Legal Design, a web designer’s perspective on this new practice" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*rPCjeVH0LLRsbDYY.png" width="700" height="699" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*rPCjeVH0LLRsbDYY.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*rPCjeVH0LLRsbDYY.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*rPCjeVH0LLRsbDYY.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*rPCjeVH0LLRsbDYY.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*rPCjeVH0LLRsbDYY.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="7ca8">To produce a legal document for print or digital distribution, it is important to be familiar with several principles that characterize graphic design, such as content and form, grid and spacing, and graphic composition.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Capabilities are being used by many Linux-based software nowadays to limit what a process can do. But I think the documentation is a bit hard to grasp and I found some parts of capabilities implementation confusing so I decided to condense my current knowledge into a shorter article.</p>



<p>The most important reference for capabilities is up-to-date man page <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>. But that doesn’t provide an easy to read introduction.</p>



<h3>Process Capabilities</h3>



<p>Permissions of regular users are very limited, while permissions of “root” user are very powerful. But processes running under “root” often don’t require full root capabilities. </p>



<p>To help reduce “root” user power, POSIX capabilities provides a way to restrict groups of privileged system operations a process and its children are allowed to do. They basically divide full “root” privilege into a set of distinct privileges. The idea of capabilities was described in POSIX 1003.1e draft that was withdrawn in 1997.</p>



<p>Each Linux process (task) has <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L134">five 64-bit numbers</a> (sets) holding capability bits (used to be 32-bit before Linux 2.6.25) which can be inspected by reading  /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status</p>



<pre>CapInh: 00000000000004c0<br>CapPrm: 00000000000004c0<br>CapEff: 00000000000004c0<br>CapBnd: 00000000000004c0<br>CapAmb: 0000000000000000</pre>



<p>These numbers (here displayed as hex digits) are acting as a bitmap encoding a set of capabilities. Full names are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inheritable</strong> – capabilities that children can inherit</li><li><strong>Permitted</strong> – capabilities the task is permitted to use</li><li><strong>Effective</strong> – capabilities actually effective</li><li><strong>Bounding</strong> set –  prior to Linux 2.6.25, the bounding set was a system-wide attribute shared by all threads, probably meant to describe a set beyond which capabilities cannot grow. Currently it is per-task set. It is a part of execve transformation logic (more later) and also limits what a process can set to its inheritable set using capset().</li><li><strong>Ambient</strong> set (since Linux 4.3) – added to give capabilities to non-0 user easily, without using setuid or file capabilities (more later).</li></ul>



<p>If a task asks to perform a privileged operation (like binding on ports &lt; 1024), the kernel checks Effective bounding set to see if <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/capability.h#L183">CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</a> is set. If it is, it continues. Otherwise, it rejects the operation with EPERM (operation not permitted). These CAP_ defines in the kernel source are numbered sequentially so CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE being 10 means a bit 1&lt;&lt;10 = 0x400 (that is the ‘4’ hex digit in my previous example). </p>



<p>The full human readable list of currently-defined capabilities can be found in your up-to-date manpage <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> (the one here is for reference only).</p>



<p>Additionally there is a library libcap to make capabilities management and inspection easier. In addition to <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/libcap.3.html">library API</a>, the package includes <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/capsh.1.html">capsh</a> utility which, among other things, allows printing its capabilities. <br></p>



<pre># capsh --print
Current: = cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
Bounding set =cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service
Ambient set =
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
 secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
 secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-ambient-raise: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)
</pre>



<p>There are a few <strong>confusing</strong> bits:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Current</strong> – displays effective, inheritable and permitted capabilities of capsh process in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_to_text.3.html"><strong>cap_to_text(3)</strong></a><strong> format</strong>. Again, it displays it in cap_to_text format which lists capabilities basically as capability[,capability…]+(e|i|p) groups, where ‘e’ means effective, ‘i’ inheritable and ‘p’ permitted. The list is not separated by ‘,’ as you would guess (cap_setgid+eip,cap_setuid+eip). The ‘,’ separates capabilities in a single +… (action) group. The actual list of action groups is then separated by spaces. So another example with two action groups would be “= cap_sys_chroot+ep cap_net_bind_service+eip”. And also these two action groups “= cap_net_bind_service+e cap_net_bind_service+ip” would encode the same meaning as  a single “cap_net_bind_service+eip”.</li><li><strong>Bounding set/Ambient set</strong>. To make things even more confusing, these two lines contain just a list of capabilities set in those sets, separated by spaces. No cap_to_text format is used here because it is not listing permitted, effective, inheritable sets together but just a single (bounding/ambient) set.</li><li><strong>Securebits</strong>: displays task’s <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L133">securebits</a> integer in as decimal/hex/fancy-verilog-convention-for-binary-strings (yes, everyone would expect it here and it’s totally clear by ‘b because every sysadmin programs its own FPGAs and ASICs). The state of securebits follows. The actual bits are defined as SECBIT_* in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/securebits.h#L22">securebits.h</a> and also described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.</li><li>The tool lacks the one important state and that is the “<strong>NoNewPrivs</strong>” which can be also seen by inspecting /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status. That is described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> only, even though it directly affects capabilities when used in conjunction with file capabilities (more later). NoNewPrivs is described as “<em>With no_new_privs set to 1, execve(2) promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without the execve(2) call (for example, rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and file capabilities non-functional). Once set, this the no_new_privs attribute cannot be unset.  The setting of this attribute is inherited by children created by fork(2) and clone(2), and preserved across execve(2).</em>“. This is the flag which Kubernetes sets to 1 when allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false in pod’s securityContext. </li></ul>



<p>When a process starts a new process by doing execve(2), capabilities are transformed to the child using the formula mentioned in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>:</p>



<pre>P'(ambient)     = (file is privileged) ? 0 : P(ambient)

P'(permitted)   = (P(inheritable) &amp; F(inheritable)) |
                  (F(permitted) &amp; P(bounding)) | P'(ambient)

P'(effective)   = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : P'(ambient)

P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

P'(bounding)    = P(bounding)       [i.e., unchanged]

where:

     P()   denotes the value of a thread capability set before the
           execve(2)

     P'()  denotes the value of a thread capability set after the
           execve(2)

     F()   denotes a file capability set
</pre>



<p>These rules describe action taken for every bit in ambient/permitted/effective/inheritable/bounding sets. It uses standard C syntax (&amp; for logic AND, | for logic OR). P’ is the child process, P is the current process calling execve(2). F are so called “file capabilities” of the file being execve’d.</p>



<p>Additionaly, a process can programmatically change its inheritable, permitted and effective sets using libpcap any  time according to these rules:</p>



<ul><li>Unless the caller have the CAP_SETPCAP, the new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(permitted)</em></li><li>(since Linux 2.6.25) The new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(bounding)</em></li><li>The new <strong>permitted</strong> set must be a subset of P(permitted) </li><li>The new <strong>effective</strong> set must be a subset of P(effective)</li></ul>



<p>As HN user eqvinox suggested, pspax from <a href="https://github.com/gentoo/pax-utils">pax-utils</a> can be used to list capabilities of running processes, just compile it with libpcap support (make USE_CAP=yes):</p>
<pre>  # pspax
  USER     PID    PAX    MAPS ETYPE      NAME             CAPS ATTR  
  root     60879  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     crond            =ep  system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0  
  root     60910  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     ntpd             cap_net_bind_service,cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_time=ep system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0
</pre>



<h3>File capabilities</h3>



<p>Sometimes a user with a reduced set of capabilities needs to run a binary which requires more capabilities. Previously, this was achieved by setuid binary (chmod +s ./executable). Such a binary, if owned by root, would assign full root privileges to it when executed by any user.</p>



<p>That gives too many privileges to the binary, so POSIX capabilities implemented a concept called “file capabilities”. They are stored as a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/xattr.7.html">extended file attribute</a> called “security.capability” so you need a capable filesystem (ext*, XFS, Raiserfs, Brtfs, overlay2, …). For a process to write to this attribute, CAP_SETFCAP capability is needed (be in process’ effective set).<br></p>



<pre>$ getfattr -m - -d `which ping`
# file: usr/bin/ping
security.capability=0sAQAAAgAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

$ getcap `which ping`  
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
</pre>



<h3>Special cases and notes</h3>



<p>Of course, life is not simple, so is not the implementation of capabilities and there are several special cases described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> man page. Probably the most important are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>setuid file bit and file capabilities are ignored if NoNewPrivs is set</strong> or filesystem is mounted nosuid or the process calling execve is being ptraced. The file capabilities are also ignored when the kernel is booted with<em> </em>no_file_caps.</li><li><strong>Capability-dumb</strong> binary is a binary converted from setuid to file capabilities without changing its code. Such binaries are often converted by setting +ep capability on them like “setcap cap_net_bind_service+ep ./binary”. The important part is “e”, effective. Upon execve, this capability is added to both permitted and effective so the executable is ready to use the privileged operation. In contrast <strong>capability-smart</strong> binary which uses libpcap or similar, can use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_set_proc.3.html">cap_set_proc(3)</a> (or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/capget.2.html">capset</a>) to set “effective” or “inheritable” bits at any point, as long as that capability is already in the “permitted” set. So “setcap cap_net_bind_service+p ./binary” would be enough for a capability-smart binary as it will be able to set the effective bit itself before calling the privileged operation.  See my <a href="https://gist.github.com/k3a/a38f4439f85eda4f77eda19c4ae8c80c">example code</a>.</li><li><strong>setuid-root binaries</strong> continue to work, giving all privileges of root when run by a non-root user. Unless they have file capabilities set, in which case only those are granted. It is also possible to create a setuid binary with empty file capability set, making it execute as 0, though without any capabilities. …</li></ul></div></div>

<p> Tagged as <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/blog.html">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/sbcl.html">sbcl</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/common-lisp.html">common-lisp</a> </p> <p> Written on 2021-02-24 21:50:00 </p> <p>It's taken me much longer than I hoped, but I finally have a second version of
my patches to build static executables tested and ready to go! This set of
patches vastly improves upon the first by reducing the amount of compilation
needed at the cost of sacrificing a little purity. Additionally I have created
a system that automates the process of building a static executable, along with
other release related tasks.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>At a Glance</h2>

<ul>
<li>The new patch set can be found on
  the
  <a href="https://github.com/daewok/sbcl/tree/static-executable-v2">static-executable-v2 branch</a> of
  my SBCL fork or at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch</code>
  with a detached signature available at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch.asc</code>
  signed with GPG
  key <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/static/keys/9ACF6934.pub">0x9ACF6934</a>.</li>
<li>You'll definitely want to build SBCL with the <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code>
  feature (newly added by the patch). You'll probably also want the
  <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature (already exists, but the patch also enables it
  on arm/arm64).</li>
<li>The new patch lets you build a static executable with less compilation of
  Lisp code.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>
  automates the process of building a static executable by tying it into ASDF.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's New?</h2>

<p>If you need a refresher about what static executables are or what use cases
they're good for, see
my <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/posts/static-executables-with-sbcl.html">previous post on this topic</a>.</p>

<p>With my previous patch, the only way you could create a static executable was
to perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the foreign symbols needed by your code. The easiest way to do
   this is to compile all your Lisp code and then dump the information from the
   image.</li>
<li>From that list of foreign symbols, create a C file that contains fills an
   array with references to those symbols.</li>
<li>Recompile the SBCL core and runtime with this new file, additionally
   disabling libdl support and linking against your foreign libraries.</li>
<li>(Re)compile all your Lisp code with the new runtime (if you made an image in
   step 1 it will not be compatible with the new runtime due to feature and
   build ID mismatches).</li>
<li>Dump the executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the most general case, this involved compiling your entire Lisp image
twice. After some #lisp discussions, I realized there was a better way of doing
this. While the previous process still works, the new recommended process now
looks like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build the image you would like to make into a static executable and save it.</li>
<li>Dump the foreign symbol info from this image and write the C file that SBCL
   can use to prelink itself.</li>
<li>Compile that C file and link it into an existing sbcl.o file to make a new
   runtime. sbcl.o is the SBCL runtime in object form, created when building
   with the <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature.</li>
<li>Load the image from step 1 into your new runtime. It will be compatible
   because the build ID and feature set are the same!</li>
<li>Dump your now static executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>This new process can significantly reduce the amount of time needed to make an
executable. Plus it lets you take more advantage of image based
development. It's fairly trivial to build an image exactly like you want, dump
it, and then pair it with a custom static runtime to make a static executable.</p>

<p>There were two primary challenges that needed to be overcome for this version
of the patch set.</p>

<p>First, the SBCL core had to be made robust to every libdl function
uncondtionally returning an error. Since we want the feature set to remain
constant we can't recompile the runtime with <code>#-os-provides-dlopen</code>. Instead,
we take advantage of the fact that Musl libc lets you link static executables
against libdl, but all those functions are noops. This is the "purity"
sacrifice I alluded to above.</p>

<p>Second, since we are reusing a image, the prelink info table (the generated C
file) needed to order the symbols exactly as the image expects them to be
ordered. The tricky bit here is that some libraries (like <code>cl-plus-ssl</code>) add
symbols to the linkage table that will always be undefined. <code>cl-plus-ssl</code> does
this in order to support a wide range of openssl versions. The previous patch
set unconditionally filtered out undefined symbols, which horribly broke things
in the new approach.</p>

<h2>More Documentation</h2>

<p>As before, after applying the patch you'll find a README.static-executable file
in the root of the repo. You'll also find a Dockerfile and an example of how to
use it in the README.static-executable.</p>

<p>You can also check out the tests and documentation in
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> feature does not work on 32-bit ARM + Musl
  libc &gt;= 1.2. Musl switched to 64-bit time under the hood while still
  mataining compatibility with everything compiled for 32-bit time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is how they maintained backwards compatibility. Every time related
  symbol still exists and implements everything on top of the 32-bit time
  interface. However, if you include the standard header file where the symbol
  is defined <em>or</em> you look up the symbol via <code>dlsym</code> you actually get a pointer
  to the 64-bit time version of the symbol. We can't use <code>dlsym</code> (it doesn't
  work in static executables). And the generated C file doesn't include any
  headers.</p>

<p>This <em>could</em> be fixed if someone is motiviated enough to create/find a
  complete, easy to use map between libc symbols and the headers that define
  them and integrate it into the prelink info generator.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> works on Windows but causes test
  failures. The root issue is that mingw64 has implemented their own
  libm. Their trig functions are fast, but use inaccurate instructions (like
  FSIN) under the hood. When prelinking these inaccurate implementations are
  used instead of the more accurate ones (from msvcrt.dll ?) found when using
  <code>dlsym</code> to look up the symbol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I would love to get feedback on this approach and any ideas on how to
   improve it! Please drop me a line (etimmons on Freenode or daewok on
   Github/Gitlab) if you have suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>I've already incorporated static executables
   into <a href="https://www.clpm.dev/">CLPM</a> and will be distributing them starting
   with v0.4.0! I'm going to continue rolling out static executables in my
   other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Pieces of the patch set are now solid enough that I think they can be
   submitted for upstream consideration. I'll start sending them after the
   current 2.1.2 freeze.</p></li>

<p>I do not know quite what it is, but Lapa who is the CMO of Eficode has a way of triggering me in such a way that I must respond. He is almost my private <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts">/r/writingprompts</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I understand the problem with the productivity improvement. E.g. with the improvement in cycle time.</p><p>But e.g. with Lead time improvement, shouldn't the impact be on the basis of accelerating revenue generation? If you know how much a feature can extract or accelerate revenue…</p></div>— Lauri Palokangas (@lpalokan) <a href="https://twitter.com/lpalokan/status/1364285665110851585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Even though I was already immersed a particularly phrasing here stood out to me.</p>



<blockquote><p>If you know how much a feature can extract or accelerate revenue..</p><cite>– Lapa</cite></blockquote>



<p>I think this is the golden goose. If we have this capability or knowing in advance how much any given task is worth, we can reason very effectively on both priority, order and when we should stop throwing more money after a thing. This would allow us to do things like Weighted Shortest Job First and in general make economic decisions. I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2NX3SEu">The Principles of Product Development Flow </a>for an in-depth treatment of this and many other insights.</p>



<p>If we could do this, we would be able to much more reason about what we should do, and how we should approach it.</p>



<p>We could reason about as in this figure</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="71" data-permalink="https://abildskov.io/image/" data-orig-file="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png" data-orig-size="786,584" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=750" src="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=786" alt="" srcset="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png 786w, https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=150 150w, https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=300 300w, https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px"></figure>



<p>But, unfortunately for most organizations the view is more like so: </p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="73" data-permalink="https://abildskov.io/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png" data-orig-size="804,581" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png?w=750" src="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png?w=804" alt="" srcset="https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png 804w, https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png?w=300 300w, https://mooseinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image-2.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px"></figure>



<p>Which is obviously a huge problem. It really enables the Highest Paid Persons Opinion (HiPPO) decision making strategy and moves us away from the Measuring of CALMS. </p>



<p>Some organizations are even further from that. They have a hard time figuring out what the cost and revenue is of a value stream. We talk so much about being outcome oriented, that we forget that many teams do not have the context and environment to be outcome <em>aware</em>, on a level more interesting that the number of magical story points they churn out. </p>



<p>I like the focus <a href="https://twitter.com/mik_kersten">Mik Kersten</a> brings to this in <a href="https://amzn.to/3khUpE5">Project to Product</a>. The flow metrics, combined with the Flow Items really brings some reasoning on a relevant level that can help us talk about productivity.</p>



<p>If we then add in this paper: </p>



<blockquote><p>Evaluating well-designed and executed experiments that were designed to improve a key metric, only about one-third were successful at improving the key metric!</p><cite><a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/ExPThinkWeek2009Public.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/ExPThinkWeek2009Public.pdf</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>It starts looking really gloom. In my experience most teams are not even at the starting stages of scientific thinking and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Modern-Software-Development/page/E38lgmr7o">hypothesis driven development</a>. And yet well-designed and executed experiments are more likely to not improve the business. What a bummer.</p>



<h2>So, DevOps Transformations</h2>



<p>We were talking about DevOps transformations. In the previous I have mostly argued for the difficulty in reasoning on the impact of a task or feature on business value. </p>



<p>So with regards to DevOps Transformations I have a few main points.</p>



<p>First off, when we try to build the <em>business case</em> of a DevOps transformation we almost always end up end some automation driven cost-down analysis. And while this might be true and valid, it is only tangentially related to DevOps, and no one was ever inspired by a visionary cost-down target. In my opinion strategy should be about raising the top-line, and then we should have a continuous focus on improving the bottom-line, but that is not for the vision.</p>



<p>Second, a DevOps transformation is a huge undertaking and trying to estimate the business case of that entire transformation would be folly. I believe that we can argue that the DevOps transformation does not set much in terms of how far we will go, but it will make it more likely that we are moving in the right direction.</p>



<p>Third, DevOps is about iterating, and we should be able to make many smaller business cases along the way. On specific, context-dependent initiatives.<br>And these improvements should be done in a hypothesis driven way. Not everything will increase productivity, speed, developer happiness or what ever is the focus area. If we are not prepared to do stuff we might have to undo afterwards, we are in dire waters.</p>



<p>Fourth, I haven’t really dug into the horrible overload of the word <em>Transformation. </em>We are not defining some function <em>f: f(x) = y</em> that will move transform one state to another. DevOps is about continuous improvement and iterations. And creating a culture where this can happen. That is not a transformation. <br>And Fourth again, the word transformation does not distance the desired end-state hard enough from the current state of affairs. This is particularly true for agile transformations. There will be blood. Someone will lose their job, or feel bullied to quit because their work has been transformed in a way that is not comfortable for them. The word transformation glosses over some of the ugly truths of a disruptive process. I paraphrase Geoffrey Moore in <a href="https://amzn.to/3ko2Xcr">Zone to Win</a> when I say “A transformation is so disruptive it takes the full attention of the CEO. There can be only one transformation at any point in time”. I think we underestimate the disruptiveness, and as such we underprioritize it in top management, and there we have already set it up to fail.</p>



<p>Fifth and Final, if we have such a hard time reasoning the impact that our work has on the business, it will be that much more difficult to reason about the impact of improving the way we work. </p>



<p>That was way too many words, but thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/lpalokan">Lapa</a> for making me think.</p>

February 24, 2021 | https://jameslittle.me/blog/2020/one-year-of-stork/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jameslittle.me/blog/2020/one-year-of-stork/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Just before the holidays, I launched version 1.0.0 of <a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork</a>, the web search library I’ve been building for just over a year. Stork is a tool for building dynamic, responsive, and native full-text search interfaces—usually only possible with a SaaS product or a web server—that can be added to static, serverless web pages. It’s free, open-source, and build-system-agnostic. It’s one of the tools I wish I had when I was starting to build websites.</p><p>If you want to try a demo or read the documentation, visit Stork’s website: <a href="https://stork-search.net/">https://stork-search.net</a>.</p><p>Working on Stork has changed how I’ve interacted with the web development community. Stork is only successful if the people who use it find it useful and delightful. Over the past few months, I’ve pushed myself outside my comfort zone and connected with other web developers to ensure that that’s the case. For the first time, I’ve gotten to talk with people from across the internet who seemed excited about the tool I’ve built, and I’ve been able to contribute back to the web development community, an online community of creatives that has shaped how I use technology.</p><p>I built Stork because I thought it should exist, but in fact, <strong>Stork was a project I didn’t know I was capable of building until I had already built it.</strong> A year ago, I had no experience with full-text search, with Rust or Webassembly—the two technologies that power Stork—or with open-source contribution. In this essay, I want to describe how I approached the first year of building Stork. First, I’ll describe why I built it; then, I’ll expound on full-text search TK what a serverless search plugin brings to the web; finally, I’ll tell you why I’m excited for the next few years of Stork.</p><h2 id="the-web-is-an-organism-that-we-all-built-together">The Web is an Organism that We All Built Together.<a href="#the-web-is-an-organism-that-we-all-built-together">#</a></h2><p>It’s hard to remember which came first: the idea for Stork, or my desire to build something (anything!) for the web development community. Web development is the corner of programming where I feel most comfortable, since it seems to foster an environment of unbounded creativity—inherent to the internet, it seems, is the idea of giving something to others. <strong>The languages that power the web are powerful, but verbose, and this verbosity means that developers are strongly encouraged to use community-built tools to speed up their development.</strong> Therefore, the creativity sparked by the web platform is not just first-order creativity—in the content that gets published—but also second-order creativity—in the <a href="https://www.arp242.net/open-source.html">open source</a> tools that are used to publish and enhance that content. The presence, ubiquity, and power of these tools makes the web development experience a communal one instead of a solo endeavor.</p><p>Without the web, I wouldn’t be a programmer, and without the tools and resources that the web development community has built, I wouldn’t have started building websites. Regrettably, I’ve found it easy to forget about the community members who have built the tools that got me into web development. It’s only recently (mostly by following folks on Twitter) that I’ve discovered the humanity and individuality of the people who build the tools I use. That discovery fueled me to create something, and eventually, that something became Stork. When I started building Stork, I wanted to create something useful to give back to the web development community, from whom I had taken so much.</p><h2 id="finding-an-unfilled-niche">Finding an Unfilled Niche<a href="#finding-an-unfilled-niche">#</a></h2><p>Working on a college newspaper and watching the editors struggle to dig old articles out of the digital archives turned me onto the idea of a search experience optimized for specific domains. The web technologies available to replace the newspaper’s custom Google search were either too expensive or too finicky, and I realized I had stumbled across a niche that seemingly didn’t have anything filling it: easy-configuration full-text web search. I theorized that sticking to client-side technologies would simplify the integration experience drastically—I didn’t want to set up another search server, so I assumed other people wouldn’t either. I then theorized that client-side full-text search didn’t exist because the technology that could power it was very new.</p><p>Around that time, Rust’s WebAssembly support had been drastically improved and increasingly publicized. I had recently listened to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/141">Marco Arment discuss his implementation of full-text search on an episode of Under the Radar</a>, and Chris Coyier had recently published his <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/">Serverless</a> microsite. I was lost in wondering what a Jamstack search experience would entail. I realized that with the right algorithm, I could build a tool in Rust that generated a heavily-compressed search index where the results were precomputed for any valid query, and where I could use the speed of WebAssembly to parse and search through that index on the client. It was around this time that I started talking about the idea (not yet named Stork) at work and online, and met some friends—<a href="https://twitter.com/noopkat">Suz Hinton</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthiasendler">Matthias Endler</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/healeycodes">Andrew Healey</a>—who were excited about the project, graciously let me bounce ideas off of them, and encouraged me to share my work more widely (to them and to others I’ve talked to: I’m incredibly grateful for your feedback, support, and friendship).</p><h2 id="search-is-a-hard-problem-to-solve">Search is a Hard Problem to Solve<a href="#search-is-a-hard-problem-to-solve">#</a></h2><p>The first few months of Stork, I spent time proving out the idea, but in transitioning Stork from a tech demo into a product, I had to find a suitable balance between building algorithmic excellency and building an intuitive experience. <strong>I strongly believe that in this stage of Stork’s development the product must be polished before the algorithm is.</strong> The speed and the search results can be “good enough” in the first years of the product, but if Stork gives off a bad first impression, then nobody will use it. This is the philosophy I brought to the first year of Stork’s development.</p><p>The early versions of Stork used <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">Readme-driven development</a> almost religiously. Before the search algorithm worked, I was building a Javascript API, building server infrastructure, and building the first search interface theme. <strong>I wrote Stork’s user-facing documentation, then made sure I wasn’t building a tool more complicated than the documentation allowed.</strong> I became obsessed with concisely describing the two steps of working with Stork: first building an index from a corpus, then loading that index into a webpage using the Stork Javascript library.</p><p>Splitting up those two steps into user-visible actions is endemic to Stork’s operation. Stork tries to front-load as much of the work as possible, precomputing search results so that the client only performs a few lookups to build its results. Today, Stork’s indexer parses documents and builds a hash-table that maps words and prefixes to their character offsets within a document. The client—the WebAssembly executable—looks up each word in the user’s query, combines the results, and uses those offsets to display excerpts from the document, giving users context for each of their search results (by necessity, each Stork index must carry the full text of every document in the index). This strategy creates search indexes that are unfortunately large, but I maintain that the resulting experience makes the tradeoff worth it.</p><p>Any full-text search algorithm involves two main pieces of functionality. First, the entire set of entries must be filtered to only those that match the search query. Second, the remaining entries must be sorted so that the most “relevant” entries are listed first. Stork’s prefix map handles the filtering, and I’ve built a rudimentary sorting algorithm that takes word-closeness, presence of queries in titles, and exact-vs-partial-match details into account—it works well in the inputs I’ve tried. Improving this ordering algorithm has taken a significant portion of Stork’s development, and most of the code I’ve deleted and rewritten has come in the form of overarching improvements to the relevance ordering. I’ve learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word">stop words</a>—words like “the,” “it,” and “and” which must be indexed but heavily devalued, about how to correctly normalize both corpus input and search input so that Power⎵ matches power, about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemming</a> algorithms that let me match tries in an index to try in a query, and I’ve watched search results improve as I incorporate each of these enhancements into Stork’s search algorithm.</p><h2 id="storks-next-steps">Stork’s Next Steps<a href="#storks-next-steps">#</a></h2><p>As I said before, I released the latest version of Stork as version 1.0.0. With this, I hope to signal Stork’s prime-time readiness and present Stork as a feature-rich project that’s ready for wider scrutiny. This is a Stork that I’m proud of and that I want to contribute to the web development community.</p><p>In encountering different open-source projects, I’ve tried to pluck the features I feel have helped me the most. The landing page contains a demo, the current version number, and working sample code (three things that an unfortunate number of landing pages seem to omit). I’ve published the project’s roadmap, and I encourage feature requests and bug reports on Github. Most importantly, though, I’m writing about Stork with a human touch, with the hope that the people who interact with the project can better recognize that there’s a coder behind the code.</p><p>I’m actively looking for people to try Stork in their own site and give me feedback. It might not be there yet (though it might be for you!), but I believe that Stork can be an easy, flexible solution to anyone who wants to implement web search, and I’m excited to put in the work to make it so. That said, Stork is far from complete. My scratchpad is pages long<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, and I plan to continue building features and enhancements for a while. As I see it, Stork will be useful until it’s irrelevant, and will be relevant until people stop building Jamstack-based sites. I’m also banking on the community to help me: feature requests, bug reports, and other communication has already helped Stork become a better tool, and I’m excited to see what further contributions the community will add to Stork.</p><p>If you’re …</p></article></div>

<p>The work presented in this thesis is faceted, and placed at the intersection of hydrology, black-box optimization and HPC. For reasons of space and time, I focused just on the last.</p>
<p>Given the diversity of topics involved, the extent of the material, the time assigned to this project, its focus on HPC, and finally my background, I had to <em>use some tools</em> (algorithms, concepts, etc.) without fully mastering them. This unavoidable fact is reflected in the frugality of the bibliography and in their presentation, which occasionally could be sloppy or contain plain errors. The responsibility for those is mine and mine only. However, I hope that the material presented here, if not the subject for more in-depth and broader research by the author, will be at least a prompt for more expert readers.</p>
<p>The growth of complexity in science, to which specialism was the universal response, is not going to decline; but maybe the compartmentalization of specialism will. When we will seek for systematic answers to the problems posed by this Cambrian explosion, one place to look will be computer science, which under many regards is the art of managing complexity by the human mind through abstractions. The simplest and most ubiquitous abstraction is the black box, and hence there is no shame in using black boxes when dealing with problems outside our competence. However, in order to make scientific statements about them, neglecting their inner workings, one needs to use the strictest rigour on the assumptions on their inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that scientists will be replaced by scientific programmers in the future. However, good scientists surely will also be good programmers, i.e. they will be able to express elegantly both declarative knowledge by means of equations and of procedural knowledge, with the help of a computer.</p>

<h2>Rage Against Machine Learning<a href="#rage-against-machine-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main problem of present scientific research is the adoption of the ideas and methods from capitalist market economy. Research institutes must profit from the work of researchers and profit is measured by publications, funding, and patents. The phenomenon is not new, but the degree to which it permeates academia is unedited. Also, it is tightly linked to the sociopolitical and economic system in which we live, and it is probably irreversible. This problem not only intoxicates the academic environment and the life of people which work in academia, but also affects negatively the quality of research. It creates positive feedback loops and inflates some research topics while stagnating others. We live in a time of a profound, yet silent, crisis in science.</p>
<p>Of course, technology and applied science, which have an immediate return, are more likely to be funded and hence get more attention from researchers. In some cases, the situation is exacerbated by lack of scientific contents and rigour. Private investments in the loop worse the situation.</p>
<p>Prominent examples of speculative bubbles are HPC and topics in machine learning as artificial neural networks. The latter deserves a word of caution. The ubiquitous application of artificial neural networks for modeling and inference, as surrogate human understanding, is the utmost failure of reductionism. We should invest more resources in their understanding, even if it is less rewarding than simply using them. Otherwise, the use of mathematical language, scientific method, and reductionism that fueled the most spectacular achievements in our understanding of nature is in danger.</p>
<p>Some problems in modern science requires HPC, although fewer than promised by exa-scale evangelists. Nonetheless, is it HPC an interesting scientific topic per se? I think that it is. Understanding the performance of large distributed systems, running thousands of coordinated processes simultaneously, is an interesting subject indeed. However, it needs a paradigm shift: it should be investigated for the sake of it, out of pure curiosity. The accent should be on comprehension, not on making things and doing stuff. Paradoxically, it is from gratuitous knowledge that the greatest technological advances come out, in the long run.</p>
<p>A related situation exists in computer science as a whole. Its cultural relevance and brief history rich of beautiful ideas are not recognized. As a consequence, programming is often taught and learned abysmally. The resources for these practices have no shortage of terms: tutorials, cookbooks, howtos. In the words of Kevlin Henney, from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbgsfeGvg3E">GOTO talk of 2018</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something else in software that we are particularly bad at: we have a very weak sense of history. So it is not simply that we keep rediscovering and reinventing the wheel, and eventually we might actually make it round; it’s that we have a very poor cultural sense of history, and so we live in a constant state of astonishment and rediscovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>At best, computer science is misunderstood, as wonderfully explained by Abelson and Sussman in their classic on the subject <span id="id1">[<a href="#id15"><span>ASPS96</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that “computer science” is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology–the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is”. Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to”.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we don’t free ourselves from utilitiarian views on computer science and programming, we will be doomed to poorly reinvent the wheel. Only when we will clearly see their beautiful ineffectiveness, we will be able to make progress.</p>
<p>It is at least naive to suggest stopping using computers for science, and appreciate procedural epistemology for his own sake only. Still, there are practical reasons to approach computing more thoughtfully.</p>
<p>In many research fields, articles, reviews, and conference proceedings account only for a part of the writing duty of researchers, the other being computer programs. Nonetheless, this is something for which they are not always given the proper credit. Furthermore, code is not always published, and its quality is not always at best. However, if programming is theory-building <span id="id2">[<a href="#id10"><span>Nau85</span></a>]</span>, then we need to consider code as literature and write correct, clear, reusable and extensively documented code to make real scientific progress and not waste our collective efforts.</p>
<p>The issue is not just the consideration we have for programming as an intellectual activity. If one wants to apply the scientific method to numerical experiments, he has to attain the same standards used for laboratory experiments: in other words, they must be reproducible. Hence, the reason of the importance of code and documentation in scientific computing is that they are part of the reproducibility effort.</p>

<h2>Math is the Ultimate Javascript Framework<a href="#math-is-the-ultimate-javascript-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I would go as far as saying that a playful interest in fundamental questions, beyond practical applications, is a good professional investment for a programmer too.</p>
<p>During the last Christmas holidays, I was chatting with my father about medium wave and longwave antennas. Since physical evidence is better than words, he suddenly went away and reappeared from the closet with a radio in his hand. It was a Grundig from the mid 80’s. Once opened the back of the radio, the ferrite rod antenna and the long and medium wave windings were clearly visible.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized and stared intensely at the inner of the radio. The whole circuitry contained less than ten bipolar junction transistors, for both amplitude and frequency modulation. I pointed with my finger at some components I wasn’t able to recognize, and asked him what they were and why they were there, as I used to do as a kid. The strangest thing to me were the small radio frequency inductors. They had small red marks made with permanent ink. A long time before, he explained to me, he marked the original positions of the tuning screws, before trying to adjust the tune. A whole piece of the circuit board was covered with wax—which I thought was glue—, to avoid changing the position and orientation of some components, changing the inductance of the circuits and losing the right tuning.</p>
<p>That world is gone<a href="#howsad" id="id3">1</a>. We now live in a world of integrated circuits. In our world, physical devices are assembled using tools similar to the ones found in software: abstractions. Black-boxes are combined, or replaced with equivalent ones. Most of the time, it is simply cheaper to use programmable electronics.</p>
<p>This transformation is concerned with physical objects only to a lesser degree. The biggest shift was cultural. A generation of highly trained engineers has become obsolete. The knowledge and mental models they used were outdated. It has not happened during a century, but in few decades. It is highly unlikely that it will not happen again. Instead, if we extrapolate the trend, it is conceivable that the timescale of transformations will become shorter and shorter, due to technological acceleration.</p>
<p>In short, there are excellent chances that the knowledge about a particular technology that one acquires today will be worthless within the time span of his professional career<a href="#frontend" id="id4">2</a>. It is probable that our high-level code will look to …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    Published 2021-02-25.
  </p>

  
    
  

  <h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Back in November 2020, Stay SaaSy <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/11/20/managing-workplace-crusaders.html">introduced</a> the term <em>workplace crusader</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech startups attract passionate people. Large companies pay well and offer a great lifestyle, so the type of personality that wants to work at a startup is often especially ambitious or driven. This can be great, but can also present a number of management challenges. One of the most difficult traits to correctly harness at a growing company is a personality type that is compelled by perfectionism, often driven by a higher sense of righteousness.</p>
<p>I like to call these folks crusaders, as they’re driven by an almost religious passion to snuff out any problem that they see. A crusader is willing to die on any hill. No issue is too small – they attack problems like “the login page doesn’t work 10% of the time” and “Billy keeps writing user stories sloppily” with the same zeal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post struck a chord with me because I am one of these people. (I asked one of my previous managers about it, and he wholeheartedly agreed.)</p>
<p>Stay SaaSy offered some good advice on how to manage workplace crusaders. But what if you are one yourself? Their post is still useful, as it can help you become easier to manage. Also, it is very clear on the importance of prioritization: You need to pick your battles.</p>
<p>However, I think there are additional things you should know. Having been involved with various organizations over the past 20 years, I have learned some lessons the hard way. Today, I want to share the seven most important of these with you. As a crusader, you have the potential to be very beneficial to the teams you end up working with. You just need to be smart about it.</p>
<p>Towards the end, I also speculate a bit on <a href="https://yngve.hoiseth.net/articles/being-a-workplace-crusader/#3-what-makes-someone-a-workplace-crusader">what makes a crusader</a>.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="2-1-choose-your-organizations-wisely">2.1 Choose your organizations wisely</h3>
<p>Whether for paid employment or volunteer work, you will want to choose organizations that prioritize improvement. The variance is extreme.</p>
<p>As an example, I used to work in the (Norwegian) Army. That was a frustrating experience. For instance, I once reported to the unit that my team needed a new extension cord. Should be simple, right? Hell, no. Ten months and several follow-ups later, the cord had still not arrived.</p>
<p>The army is a huge beast that you would expect to be slow and resistant to change. But you can run into trouble in smaller organizations too. I once worked as a mechanic for a small bicycle repair shop. The shop was extremely messy. I tried tidying things up, but got berated by the owner, as he was used to the mess being the way it was. That was also not a good match for me.</p>
<p>So far, I have found tech startups to be the best fit. They may be a mess, but they are also very interested in making improvements, and they are anything but bureaucratic. There are probably other types of employers that would be a good fit too, such as manufacturing, franchising operations and some parts of management consulting.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in an organization that does not value your contributions, consider looking elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-accept-that-people-are-very-different">2.2 Accept that people are very different</h3>
<p>People’s personalities and talents vary widely. For example, some people are empathizers rather than systematizers. They might be very interested in helping and connecting with people and rather uninterested in some technical flaw that is very important to you. This doesn’t mean that there is something wrong with them. They are just different.</p>
<p>Others may also have very different priorities than you do. A problem with your customer service process might seem very important to you right now. But if your manager is struggling to meet payroll, they will not prioritize your request. And they will probably not tell you why.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-learn-to-fix-things-yourself">2.3 Learn to fix things yourself</h3>
<p>Every organization is, at least to some extent, a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2016716.2016740"><em>do-ocracy</em></a>. This means that you can often fix things yourself. You just have to learn how to do it. For example, you can learn how to <a href="http://automatetheboringstuff.com/">automate the boring stuff with Python</a>.</p>
<p>If you do decide to fix things yourself, make sure to be transparent about it. There is often a reason why things are the way they are, and changing them can have consequences that did not occur to you. (See <a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/">Chesterton’s Fence</a>. The more initiative you have, the more good judgment you need.) </p>
<p>Therefore, you need to let your manager know what you are doing and give them time to object. Over time, you will get better at judging your own ideas.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-be-concrete-explicit-and-constructive">2.4 Be concrete, explicit and constructive</h3>
<p>Stay SaaSy writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crusaders can exhaust their teams, and they can aggravate others who don’t share their idealism or perfectionism … If left unchecked they can transition into a more harmful place by becoming complainers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to avoid exhausting your colleagues, be concrete and explicit about your observations, uncertainties and expectations. For example, instead of saying “our customer service process sucks”, you could saying something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It took us 23 business days to be resolve our customer Carl’s issue. I think this harmed his impression of us. A lot of the delay seems to come from handovers. Maybe we should look into what happens when support agents hand over requests to others? I think we would also benefit from measuring these handover times somehow.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I am not sure that we need to prioritize this right away, as we may have some more pressing issues. But I think it should be a priority to look into this in the next three months or so.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-5-be-patient">2.5 Be patient</h3>
<p>Very few problems are really critical. In the words of Stay SaaSy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few cases of letting minor issues go, it becomes easier to realize that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many problems naturally resolve themselves with time</li>
<li>Many other problems are not existential</li>
<li>If you leave these low severity or self-resolvable problems, you and your team have more energy to tackle the challenges that really matter. This can be surprisingly hard to do for people who are very invested in their work, but when done right it can add much-needed balance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Related to this is Paul Graham’s advice to <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">do things that don’t scale</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-6-write-things-down-and-talk-to-your-colleagues">2.6 Write things down and talk to your colleagues</h3>
<p>Writing is very useful. It</p>
<ol>
<li>helps you get things out of your head;</li>
<li>makes it easier to deal with emotions;</li>
<li>adds clarity and therefore understanding;</li>
<li>builds lasting insight in the organization; and</li>
<li>levels the playing field between aggressive and passive communicators, different cultural backgrounds, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it might be good to also schedule a meeting. There are three reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many people, especially managers, have overflowing inboxes and use their calendar to manage their time. If it’s in their calendar, it’s happening. If not, who knows. Don’t be shy about inviting for meetings. If they think you ask for too many meetings, they will tell you. </li>
<li>Written communication is really hard. Before you know it, you have hurt or frustrated the other person. Talking is a lot easier, in part because you can pick up on their reactions continuously.</li>
<li>For many people, especially managers, writing feels like work. Talking to others is easier and more fun. Therefore, it might be easier to get a meeting with them than to get a written response.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-7-study-prior-art">2.7 Study prior art</h3>
<p>Simultaneously improving things and accepting the things you cannot improve is hard. Fortunately, a lot of people have shared their experiences. They can help you become more effective at moving your organization in the right direction as well as managing your emotions.</p>

<p>You might also be interested in Ruthanne Huising’s 2019 paper <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1277">Moving off the Map: How Knowledge of Organizational Operations Empowers and Alienates</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-what-makes-someone-a-workplace-crusader">3 What makes someone a workplace crusader?</h2>
<p>Putting a name on the workplace crusader concept got me thinking about the psychology behind it. What kinds of people are more likely to become workplace crusaders? How could employers and career advisors identify them?</p>
<p>To speculate, I think there are a couple of personality traits that help predict crusading:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience">Openness to experience</a>: You need to be able to imagine a different state of things in order to want change.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism">Neuroticism</a>: The more dissatisfied you are with things, the more motivated you will be to fix them.</li>
</ol>
<p>As alluded to above, I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory">systematizers</a> tend to be more common among workplace crusaders.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Zimbardo#Time">Philip Zimbardo’s Time Perspective Theory</a>. I suspect that having a <em>future life goal-oriented time perspective</em> would make you more likely to be a workplace crusader. However, considering Zimbardo’s relaxed relationship with scientific integrity (<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-45337-001">paper</a>, <a href="http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-241-thibault-le-texier-on-debunking-the-stanford-prison-e.html">podcast episode</a>), I am hesitant to put too much weight on this.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from you if you know anything that would help me learn more about this. For example, what words would psychologists use if they were to write about workplace crusaders?</p>
<h2 id="4-conclusion">4 Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize, if you are a workplace crusader, I advise you to</p>

        <p>With the emergence of Bitcoin and recently proposed stablecoins from BigTechs, such as Diem (formerly Libra), central banks face growing competition from private actors offering their own digital alternative to physical cash. We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is an effort led by Ferrous Systems and its newly formed subsidiary Critical Section GmbH to qualify the Rust Language and Compiler for use in the safety-critical domain. This is the third post in a series detailing our plans and actions around this effort, addressing topics discussed in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-pitch/">The Pitch</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-plan/">The Plan</a>. Ferrocene's draft name was "Sealed Rust."</p>

<p>Our goal is to <strong>improve the status-quo of software quality and correctness in safety-critical domains</strong> by enabling the use of the Rust Programming Language for safety-critical software development. We believe that Rust is a significant improvement over existing tools both from a safety and quality perspective and as an improvement for developer productivity.</p>

<p>You can follow the progress on these efforts on the <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/">Ferrous Systems' Blog</a>, by <a href="https://eepurl.com/guoC6P">subscribing to our newsletter</a>, or by <a href="mailto:ferrocene@critical-section.com">contacting us directly</a>.
Ferrocene is currently looking for partner commitments! Please get in <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">touch via email</a> if interested.</p>

<p>Since our last post in February 2020, we have moved Ferrocene from an idea to an actual project. We strengthened our contacts with interested companies and went deeper into our industrial and language research.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-route-user-research">Finding a route: User Research</h2>

<p>Over the last 1.5 years, we have conducted several interviews with parties deploying software in safety-critical or mission-critical environments. The participants were diverse, from cloud providers to vehicle manufacturers. We found broad interest in adopting Rust in those industries.</p>

<p>There were several key takeaways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rust as a language is seen as the big contender in critical spaces. Particularly, its focus on rigor and stability is seen as a major competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>At the same time, language evolution and improvement speed is also a crucial factor of interest.</li>
  <li>There is a desire for improvement over current language specification practices.</li>
  <li>Rust only having one main compiler at the moment is seen as a strength at the current phase of the language.</li>
  <li>Interviewed organisations see the language on a good trajectory towards their needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>On further investigation, we found a lot of openness and desire for modern, tool-assisted specification and verification techniques. Rust was regarded as being on a good path and quoted as being a language that was already easier to analyze and inspect than other languages. For that reason, we researched existing practices.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we overwhelmingly found that the projects and tools already providing analysis and further safety guarantees operate on <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">MIR</a>, Rust's mid-level intermediate representation, and other IR rather than the Rust source language. They utilized MIR to carry program meaning in a simplified manner, enabling easier analysis and reasoning. As such, a desire expressed was visibility into changes to MIR and versioned stability.</p>

<p>When further interviewed on stability, organizations expressed a desire to adopt a technology that continually increases safety and assurance levels. Most organizations considered stability a consequence of structured, deliberate changes between documented milestones one can predictably target. We summed this up as "addressability". This framing resonated in interviewed organizations.</p>

<p>There was a high respect for Rust's software practices both inside and outside of the main project. It was mentioned as a strong point that many traditionally research-related tasks are conducted within the project.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there was a shared desire to produce safer, higher-quality software <strong>faster</strong> and a sense that <strong>fundamental changes are necessary</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="finding-an-orientation-why-ferrocene">Finding an orientation: why Ferrocene?</h2>

<p>A key question from these discussions with industry-leaders: what is Ferrocene, the product, and how does it relate to Rust? There was strong interest from potential clients that work that <em>can be</em> upstreamed into the Rust compiler <em>should be</em> wherever possible. We believe this points to a focus shift in the industry. Companies understand the value of FOSS as a neutral commons but also want to invest through initiatives that work towards their goals.</p>

<p>There are services required for mission and safety-critical industries that go beyond shipping a compiler. This includes (very) long-term support, qualification packages, industry-specific tooling, backends and targets, training, verification help and industry-specific advice. This is Ferrocene, the product.</p>

<p>During our conversations with industry leaders, we found that there's a need for Ferrocene as a wider initiative. Increasing the trust level of the Rust compiler will benefit many industries, and focusing only on typical safety-critical environments is one part of the picture. Improvements in the trust level of the core technology benefit <em>all</em> participants in the ecosystem. For example, we see efforts in better describing the semantics of Rust as it exists today as an important baseline for guiding the evolution of the language.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is both. It is a product to serve markets that need high assurances and committments. It is an initiative to take Rust to the next level of reliabilty and trust. Out of that comes a strong desire for collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="having-a-direction-first-waypoints">Having a direction: First Waypoints</h2>

<p>We intend to publish a solidified roadmap for Ferrocene by June 2021.</p>

<p>A major early milestone for Ferrocene is achievable criticality levels. Currently, we're aiming at ISO 26262/ASIL-B qualification readiness and general availability by the end of 2022. Along the way, we will work closely with early adopters to increase the toolchain's quality and gather feedback and experiences.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is a vehicle for a versioned Rust and MIR specification, paired with automated verification of Rust semantics. These "runnable specs" give developers in mission-critical and high-security environments a sound, proven, and addressable foundation for building critical libraries, analysis tools, and further system assurances.</p>

<p>Critical Section is also committed to improving the developer experience in mission and safety-critical industries. Ferrocene includes efforts to bring existing verification tools, like MIRI, to a production-ready state, while also improving the ease and advanced capabilities of formally verifying Rust programs.</p>

<h2 id="finding-partners-the-travel-group">Finding Partners: The travel group</h2>

<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, but also a lot of experiences to tap into.</p>

<p>Ferrous Systems and Critical Section are calling for additional partners to join that effort! We're interested in partners from many industries, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway and aerospace</li>
  <li>Operators of mission-critical infrastructure with high-reliability and security concerns, such as cloud vendors</li>
  <li>Hardware vendors</li>
  <li>Compiler vendors</li>
  <li>Organisations that require structured knowledge of their base systems</li>
  <li>Is interested in building strong, deep Rust knowledge now</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners also get early access to Ferrocene releases and can follow the development closely with engineer support.</p>

<p>If that describes your organisation, <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">we're happy to be in touch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-engine">Starting the engine</h2>

<p>In August 2020, Ferrous Systems GmbH created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Critical Section GmbH. Critical Section started work on Ferrocene in September 2020, setting up roadmaps, finalizing user research, and outreach to partners. Ferrocene is currently managed by Florian Gilcher and Sabree Blackmon.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to thank Tim Reed and Jack Greenbaum from Green Hills Software for their constant advice, guidance and collaborative experimentation along the way.</p>

<p>Dice is all we do here at Awesome Dice, and as often as we talk about the bad old days of coloring in dice with crayons from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons boxed set, that was actually very recently in the history of dice. As it turns out, dice date back about as long as human civilization does, with the earliest dice found in Egyptian tombs and archeological digs in ancient Sumeria.</p>
<p>Above is a brief timeline of the history of dice along with a map showing you where the historical events took place. Below we’ll talk about some of the sources and debunk a couple of the false claims of oldest dice.</p>

<h2>Some Debunking</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0057/6408/7896/files/ancient-dice-250x127.jpg?v=1577137780" alt="ancient roman dice"></p>
<p>Gamers doing some cursory poking around on the internet might notice a few claims of older dice that are not included in this history. Certainly if you know of something we missed, please drop a comment with a link to the sources! However, there are some seemingly official-looking stories out there that don’t withstand scrutiny. Here are the big ones:</p>
<p><strong>Burnt City Dice:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If you go looking around online for the oldest dice found, you will inevitably stumble on a site talking about the world’s oldest backgammon set found in the Burnt City, along with the oldest set of dice. Every report of this find can be sourced back to a single Persian Journal article from 2004 (no longer online). This story has been repeated and scraped and reposted countless times across the internet. I have not been able to find any reports confirming the dice from the Burnt City that doesn’t take its text from the Persian Journal article.</p>
<p>Over at Chess Quest<span>&nbsp;</span>this article [dead link removed]<span>&nbsp;</span>does a pretty good and well-documented job of debunking the reports of the Burnt City backgammon set &amp; dice. Furthermore, it looks like the photo of ancient dice used in the article and every other repost of the article were actually taken from a now defunct website. The dice are from a collection of ancient dice and are actually roman dice made of bone dated from 100 BCE to 100 AD, and have nothing to do with the Burnt City. Thus this story doesn’t hold up enough to be included in the history of dice.</p>
<p><strong>5000 BCE Dice:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>There are a handful of sites out on the web that claim that dice have been found dated back to 5000 BCE, and of course none of them list any sources. I’m pretty sure that this mis-dating also comes from that pesky Burnt City Persian Journal article. The article made reference to dice from 5,000 years ago. I strongly suspect that someone misinterpreted that as meaning 5000 BCE, and like the Burnt City story itself, the misinformation spread across the web.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>11/11/2012: Added new oldest d20 for Egyptian d20 at Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>5/26/2012: Added Tutankhamen knucklebone reference.</p>
<p>If you are aware of an oldest dice find or a significant archaeological find that you think should be added, please drop a comment with a link to the source and we’ll get it added if we can verify the info, and if we think it’s significant enough to squeeze in.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>
  Imagine you just implemented an amazing new feature that will change the life of thousands of users. You fixed all the review suggestions from your awesome colleagues and are finally ready to merge and deploy. However, continuous integration (CI) defeats this plan by revealing a minor bug. And because CI is just too slow, releasing this feature now has to wait till tomorrow.</p><p>If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. At Shopify, we run automated CI, like executing tests or code linting, on every git push. While we all agree that this should be fast, it's not an easy task if you have more than 170,000 tests to execute. Our developers were frustrated and that was the reason to run a dedicated project improving the speed of Shopify’s CI. I’ll show you how the Test Infrastructure team was able to reduce the p95 of Shopify’s core monolith CI from 45 minutes to 18.</p><p>The Test Infrastructure team is responsible for ensuring Shopify’s CI systems are scalable, robust, and usable. Our team set the objective: run the CI of Shopify's Core monolith in under 10 minutes in the 95th percentile. 95th percentile means that 95% of all builds are faster than 10 minutes. This was an ambitious goal because our CI's 95th percentile was around 45 minutes.
</p><h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
<p>It's important to mention that our <a href="https://buildkite.com/" target="_blank" title="Buildkite - Lightning fast testing and delivery for all your software projects" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CI runs on Buildkite</a>. Buildkite gives us the flexibility to run the CI servers in our own cloud infrastructure. This has several advantages like aggressive scaling, support of different architectures and better integration and customization. For instance, it allowed us to implement our own instrumentation framework which was crucial for the success of this project.</p>
<p>In Buildkite, a pipeline is a template of the steps you want to run. There are many types of steps, some run shell commands, some define conditional logic, and others wait for user input. When you run a pipeline, a build is created. Each of the steps in the pipeline end up as jobs in the build, which then get distributed to available agents. The agents are installed on our CI servers and polling Buildkite for work, running build jobs and reporting back the results. Each server runs several of these agents at the same time and we scale the number of servers based on demand throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Setting Priorities With Data Driven Development</h2>
<p>There’s a popular carpenter saying: <em>Measure twice and cut once.</em> In other words, one should double check one's measurements for accuracy before cutting a piece of wood. Otherwise it may be necessary to cut again, wasting time and material. At the beginning, we took this saying to heart and invested in setting up instrumentation for our CI. We had a good foundation, as we already measured job and build times. However, this only gave us an idea that there was <strong>something</strong> slow, but not <strong>what</strong> was slow. On top of that, we needed to instrument every command executed.</p>
<figure><img alt="A scatter plot of commands execution count vs average duration" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image3.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image3.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235">
<figcaption>Scatter Plot with the Two Dimensions: Execution Time and Number of Executions per Command</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With this instrumentation in place, we built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia Scatter Plot" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">scatter plot</a> with the two dimensions: execution time and number of executions per command. The dots in the top right corner are the commands that take the most time and get executed the most (our top priority). This information was tremendously important to setting priorities, and we discovered three main areas to focus on: preparing agents, building dependencies, and executing the actual tests.
</p><h2>Improving Docker Start Time by Reducing I/O Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>We grouped things like downloading the source code, restoring caches or starting docker containers for services like MySQL under preparing agents. These commands consumed around 31% of the time spent in CI, almost 1/3. This was a huge area to improve.</p>
<p>One bottleneck we discovered quickly was that starting the docker containers sometimes took up to 2 minutes. Our first assumption was that the CI machines were underprovisioned. It's important to know that we run several Buildkite agents on each testing machine (sometimes running more than 50 containers per machine). Our first experiment was to reduce the number of agents we scheduled on each machine that indeed reduced the time it took to start a docker container to a few seconds. However, one of our goals was to not increase the cloud computing expenses by more than 10%. Running more machines would have blown our budget, so this was not an option for now!</p>
<p>After more debugging, we tracked down that disk I/O was the bottleneck for starting docker containers. Right before starting containers, cached directories are downloaded and written to the disk. These directories include compiled assets or bundled gems. They often reach more than 10GB per machine. You can set a percentage of system memory that can be filled with "dirty" pages—memory pages that still need to be written to disk—before a background process kicks in to write them to disk. Whenever this threshold is reached, which is most of the time after downloading caches, I/O is blocked until the dirty pages are synced. The slow start of docker containers wasn’t the actual problem, but a symptom of another problem.</p>
<figure><img alt="Line Chart of Docker Start Time Improvements Dropping from 125 Seconds to 25 Seconds on p95" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image1.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image1.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235">
<figcaption>Line Chart of Docker Start Time Improvements Dropping from 125 Seconds to 25 Seconds on p95</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once we knew the root cause, we implemented several fixes. The disk size was increased and the write speed increased proportionally with it. Additionally, we mounted most of the caches as read-only. The advantage is that we share read-only caches between agents, only needing to download and write them once per machine. Our p95 for starting containers improved from 90 seconds to 25 seconds, almost 4 times faster! We now write less data a lot faster.</p>
<h2>The Fastest Code Is the Code That Doesn’t Run</h2>
<p>While the improvements for preparing the test execution benefited all of Shopify, we also implemented improvements specifically to the Rails monolith most of Shopify's engineers work on (my team’s main focus). Like most Rails apps, before we can run any tests we need to prepare dependencies like compiling assets, migrating the database, and running bundle install. These tasks were responsible for consuming about 37% of the time spent in CI. Combined with preparing agents it meant that 68% of the time in CI was spent just on overhead before we actually ran any test! To improve the speed of building dependencies, we actually didn’t optimize our code. Instead we tried not to run the code at all! Or to quote <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22863108-practical-maya-programming-with-python" target="_blank" title="Practical Maya Programming with Python by Robert Galankis" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Robert Galanakis</a>: “The fastest code is the code that doesn’t run.”</p>
<p>How did we do that? We know that only a small number of pull requests change the database or assets (most of the Shopify frontend code is in separate repositories). For database migrations, we calculate an MD5 hash of our structure.sql file and db/migrate folder. If the hash is the same as our cache, we don't need to load the Rails app and run db:migrate. A similar approach was implemented for asset compilation. On top of that, we also run these steps in parallel that resulted in an improvement from 5 minutes to around 3 minutes only for this job.</p>
<h2>The 80/20 Rule Applies to Tests Too</h2><p>
After preparing agents and building dependencies, the remaining time is spent on running tests. In Shopify Core, we have more than 170,000 tests, which grow annually by 20-30%. It takes more than 41 hours to run all tests on a single machine. To put this into context, watching all 23 Avengers movies takes around 50 hours. The sheer amount of tests and their growth makes it unrealistic to optimize the tests themselves.</p><p><a href="https://shopify.engineering/spark-joy-by-running-fewer-tests" target="_blank" title="Spark Joy by Running Fewer Tests" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Around one year ago we released a system</a> to only run tests related to the code change. Rather than running all 170,000 tests on every pull request we’d only run a subset of our test suite. In the beginning, it was merely an approach to fight flaky tests but it also reduced the test execution time significantly. While the original implementation turned out to be very reliable, it mostly focused on Ruby files. However, other non-Ruby files like JSON or YAML files also change frequently and often would trigger a full test run. It was time to go back and improve the original implementation.</p><p>For instance, the initial implementation of our test selection ignored changes to ActiveRecord fixtures that meant a change to a fixture file would always trigger a full test run. As changes to fixture files are quite frequent and have low risk of breaking production, we decided to create a test mapping for them. Luckily ActiveRecord already creates an <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html" target="_blank" title="Active Support Instrumentation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ActiveSupport notification</a> for every SQL query it executes. By subscribing to these events, we were able to create a mapping of which fixtures were used in which tests. We can look up the tests we need to run by looking at what files have been modified, added, removed, or renamed. This change, along with several other new test mappings, increased the percentage of builds that didn't select all tests from 45% to over 60%. A nice side effect was that the test stability also increased from 88% to 97%.</p><p>With all these changes in place, we also noticed that a small percentage of tests are responsible for the slowest CI builds. This corresponds with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" title="Pareto principle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pareto principle</a> which states, “that for many outcomes roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes.” For instance, we discovered that one test frequently hangs and causes CI to timeout. Although we already wrap each test into a <a href="https://medium.com/@adamhooper/in-ruby-dont-use-timeout-77d9d4e5a001" target="_blank" title="In Ruby, don’t use timeout()" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ruby timeout block, it wasn’t 100% reliable</a>. Unfortunately, my team doesn’t have the necessary context and capacity to fix broken tests. Sometimes we even have to disable tests if they cause too much “harm” to Shopify and other developers. This is of course a last resort, and we always notify the original authors to give them the opportunity to investigate and come up with a fix. In this case, by temporarily removing these tests we improved the p95 by 10 minutes from around 44 minutes to 34.

<article>
    
<p>Between the negative impacts on mental health, the spread of disinformation, and concerns with data privacy, the problems with social media seem more in the spotlight than ever before. <em>The Social Dilemma</em>, a recent Netflix documentary highlighting these problems (with help from the people who created them), has reached 100 million people in 190 countries <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It’s no exaggeration to say the problems with social media are a mainstream topic.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this visibility has also led to more awareness. At the end of <em>The Social Dilemma</em>, several countermeasures are recommended, including turning off notifications, uninstalling apps, and thinking twice before sharing clickbait material. There are now <a href="https://www.hidefeed.com/">browser extensions</a> that will block recommendations and news feeds, and instead encourage intentional browsing.</p>
<p>These are all great, but they are only temporary patches. We can only work around a broken system for so long. For a lasting change, we need to rethink the system itself. There has been some discussion around this, such as this <a href="https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/1278116194621419520">twitter thread</a> of what a better social network would look like, and <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/technologists">this guide</a> to human-centric principles for new technologists. But most of the discussion has been at a high level. For meaningful progress, we need to get specific.</p>
<p>What would social media look like if it were designed today? What features should we add or remove? How do we build something that users want AND is good for them? To explore these questions, I’ll start with the user I know best - myself.</p>
<p><strong>How would I design the ideal social media for me, knowing what I know today?</strong></p>

<p>First, it helps to reflect on my own experience. For context, I have primarily used Facebook to connect with friends since 2010. I recently started using Twitter, and very occasionally check Instagram.</p>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p>There are several use cases where social media adds value to my life. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing occasional life updates or new content with friends and receiving supportive comments and engagement</li>
<li>Posing a question or asking for recommendations and receiving thoughtful responses, sometimes from people I don’t normally talk to</li>
<li>Seeing updates every few days from ~5-10 close friends (who I’ve marked as Show First on Facebook)</li>
<li>Seeing major life updates every few months from a wider range of acquaintances</li>
<li>Directly checking the Twitter feeds of ~5-10 people I admire and learning something new or getting inspiration</li>
<li>Visiting David Goggin’s Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidgoggins/">page</a> and receiving a healthy dose of motivation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, I am happy about my social media use when I feel like I am able to seek out updates intentionally from the people I care about. When my browsing is centered on people, not posts. When I choose what content I want to see, not the algorithm. The added serendipity of the algorithm can be nice to periodically check-in with distant connections or discover new people, but for the most part I am happiest when not pulled away on distractions and tangents.</p>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p>My worst experiences with social media include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrolling through my Facebook and Twitter feeds for a “quick break” only to get sucked in and come out scattered, disoriented, and anxious</li>
<li>Sharing a post, then spending too much time checking for new notifications that it distracts me from meaningful work.</li>
<li>Procrastinating by opening the apps for a brief dopamine hit of relief from whatever happens to show up on my feed</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of my bad experiences involve falling into the short-term reward traps. Features that were designed to take advantage of our primitive brains to increase engagement - notifications, the algorithm, and the infinite news feed - pulled me into spending more time on these platforms than I was happy with. In past attempts to manage this problem, I’ve deleted apps from my phone and deactivated my Facebook account several times.</p>

<p>How would I design a social media platform that maximizes the positive value while minimizing the negative aspects? Here are some ideas.</p>
<h3 id="1-post-without-distractions">1. Post without Distractions</h3>
<p>If I want to post something on Facebook or Twitter, or Instagram, I have to go through the home page, where I’m met with a stream of content and notifications carefully curated to steal my attention. Instead, we could encourage more intentional usage by making the home page a minimal space where one can publish content without the noise of a newsfeed in the background.
Substack’s dashboard does a good job of this for newsletters.</p>

<h3 id="2-center-on-people-not-posts">2. Center on People, not Posts</h3>
<p>Instead of a feed of posts, we should have a feed of people we care about. Each person can be a card with their photo and name. When you click on their card, it takes you to their profile with their latest updates. People can be organized into different categories - close friends, acquaintances, influencers, etc, and those with new updates can be pinned at the top. With this design, I can still keep up to date with people I care about, but do it on my own terms. Scrolling through people instead of posts would also discourage the mindless scrolling that comes with an infinitely refilling feed.</p>

            <h4>Super rough rendition of feed centered on people</h4>

</figure>

<h3 id="3-replace-the-feed-with-a-digest">3. Replace the feed with a Digest</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving notifications throughout the day, we should batch updates in a daily digest that you can read every morning. Similar to reading the morning paper with your cup of coffee, you can get a consolidated view of updates from the 10-20 people you care most about. Every week or month, we could consolidate updates from a wider range of acquaintances, akin to the “Sunday Paper” of print newspapers. This would allow me to still stay connected in meaningful ways without unnecessarily consuming precious time and attention.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-about-all-the-other-issues">But what about all the other issues?</h2>
<p>I haven’t mentioned anything about how this better social media would become a sustainable business, nor how it would address the major issues with social media companies today, including content moderation, data privacy, and polarization. My gut feeling is that the profitability will be increasingly related to these issues in the future.</p>
<p>This particular thought experiment focuses on the aspects of social media that personally affect my wellbeing the most. However, I do believe that on a long enough time horizon, tools that align their incentives with human wellbeing will come out on top.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Social media is ripe for an evolution. Let’s use the lessons of hindsight and our personal experiences to re-imagine what a wholesome social internet looks like. Then let’s make it happen.</p>

<p>YOUR ORDER HISTORY. Your credit card information. Even your intimate health data.</p>



<p>Amazon is amassing an empire of data as the online retailer ventures into ever more areas of our lives. But the company's efforts to protect the information it collects are inadequate, according to insiders who warn the company's security shortfalls expose users' information to potential breaches, theft and exploitation.</p>



<p>The warnings about privacy and compliance failures at Amazon come from three former high-level information security employees — one EU-based and two from the U.S. — who told POLITICO they had repeatedly tried to alert senior leadership in the company's Seattle HQ, only to be sidelined, dismissed or pushed out of the company in what they saw as professional retaliation. </p>



<p>The EU-based employee is fighting the terms of their departure from Amazon through European courts. All three spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern they could face retaliation or difficulties in the job market for discussing the details of non-public legal proceedings. </p>



<p>Put together, their accounts paint a picture of a corporate culture at Amazon that they say prioritizes growth over other factors, such as the security of customers' information, compliance with rules designed to safeguard that data and the careers of employees the company hired specifically to flag problems.</p>



<p>“Imagine if a company the size of Amazon had a breach? The issue is millions of people's personal identifiable information is at risk,” the first former U.S.-based information-security employee said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Amazon said that maintaining customers' trust by protecting their privacy and ensuring the security of their data is a "long-standing top priority" for the company. </p>



<p>"These inaccurate, unsubstantiated and dated claims don’t reflect our commitment to keeping personal information safe. Amazon has comprehensive, long-established privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place. We regularly audit our services to ensure compliance and have zero tolerance for employees at all levels who do not follow our policies," he said. </p>



<p>At a time when lawmakers and government officials are ramping up scrutiny of tech companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the employees' complaints are likely to strike a chord with regulators.</p>



<p>While Amazon has faced plenty of heat over its labor practices — including alleged efforts to suppress union activity at its warehouses — its handling of data has received less attention.</p>



<p>Yet the company is one of Big Tech's most powerful players when it comes to data, thanks to the hoards of customer information it collects via its e-commerce platform, its online advertising business and its gigantic cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. </p>



<p>Garfield Benjamin, a British academic <a href="https://inforrm.org/2020/01/29/amazon-echos-privacy-issues-go-way-beyond-voice-recordings-garfield-benjamin/" target="_blank">who has previously written about Amazon’s privacy lapses</a>, said that the company's "disregard for privacy and security" was indicative of a "big problem."</p>

<p>“It seems bizarre — although perhaps unfortunately all too common — that a company so intent on making data its primary business should have such poor practices,” Benjamin said when shown POLITICO’s findings. He added, "Is their hubris so great, their assumed power so unassailable, that they see themselves as completely untouchable?” </p>



<p>The consequence for consumers is more than potential loss of trust in Amazon's privacy and security practices. The company's practices leave it vulnerable<strong> </strong>to potential breaches or hacks that could put highly sensitive information into the hands of malicious actors. </p>



<p>The data Amazon holds includes order history, payment information, data collected through its advertising business and, for sellers on its platform, forms of identification. In the wrong hands, it could be held for ransom against the threat of online publication; deployed to defraud people; used to get access to other online accounts; or leveraged in phishing attacks in which stolen data is used to trick victims into paying a fee or revealing even more sensitive information.  </p>



<p>More broadly, the accounts raise questions about what corporate values are rewarded at a company that has risen quickly to become the world's dominant e-commerce player.</p>



<h3>Data labyrinth</h3>



<p>ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. information-security employees, data is at risk because Amazon has a poor grasp of what data it has, where it is stored and who has access to it. </p>



<p>“If you wanted to do a 'right to be forgotten,' it would be next to impossible for Amazon to identify all of the places where your data resides within their system,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. The right to be forgotten, or right to have data erased, is a key tool for citizens under several privacy regimes, including in Europe and California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second U.S.-based information-security professional confirmed Amazon's shaky understanding of what reams of personal information it holds. “Amazon has grown so fast, it doesn't know what it owns … &nbsp;They don't know where their data is at, so they don’t know if they are protecting it correctly,” the person said.</p>



<p>The company’s track record on key data-security principles — controlling who has access to what data, patching vulnerabilities, ability to detect hacks, even whether passwords are changed regularly — came in for particular flak<strong> </strong>from all of the insiders who, together, have decades of experience in the area of information security.</p>



<p>“The quality of the controls that Amazon has in place is appalling. We found hundreds of thousands of accounts where the employee is no longer there but they still have system access,” said the first former U.S.-based employee, adding that such a vast number was possible because of Amazon's massive workforce and rapid staff turnover.<strong> </strong>Amazon said it has strict procedures in place when employees leave the company that remove their access.</p>



<p>Amazon has struggled to patch vulnerabilities in its systems. According to internal security reports from 2016 and 2017 seen by one of the former employees,<strong> </strong>the company declared that it was managing to patch between 55 to 70 percent of its systems. The first former U.S.-based employee likened that to leaving a house with several windows and doors open. </p>



<p>“Amazon’s information technology general controls, considering my experience and where I've been in the past, would not have passed muster with most auditors,” the first former U.S.-based employee said. "They were just poorly managed."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weak controls mean the company may not even detect a hack. An internal Amazon memo seen by one of the former employees from June 2018 deemed there was a “very high” possibility of critical financial loss or reputational damage to the business because of the company’s “inability to identify adversarial events.”</p>

<p>Amazon said it was not aware of the reports and does not believe the claims to be accurate. It said that any historic concerns that are flagged through routine internal reporting would be fixed, which is the purpose of these processes.</p>



<p>The second former U.S.-based employee confirmed that Amazon fails to properly control access to systems, and that, in a company whose workforce has grown to more than 1 million, reams of personal information are accessible to people who do not have the appropriate role or responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You've got tens of thousands of … teams connecting to big data," said the second former U.S.-based employee. "You should have a way to follow all the different types of data. From a technology point of view, you need to know where the data is going and how it's being protected. That does not exist,” they said.</p>



<p>The former employees were careful to distinguish between issues around Amazon’s internal approach to data compliance and the company’s leading track record in data-security engineering — visible through the products and services developed by AWS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS’s cloud computing products are used by the likes of the U.S. government, and are widely seen as world-beating in terms of data security. One ex-employee described the security tools at Amazon’s disposal as “second to none,” but they said the strength of AWS tools in keeping systems secure is still dependent on how the end user applies them. They also noted that AWS is largely run separately from the rest of the company.  </p>



<p>The issue, they said, is that Amazon's data-security capabilities are undermined by the willingness of the company to override internal controls.</p>



<p>For instance, according to two of the former information-security professionals, data needed for new projects was sometimes improperly classified so that it would go through fewer internal checks. </p>



<p>The company said this is false. A spokesperson said it has comprehensive privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place that are observed by executives at all levels. The company regularly audits services to ensure compliance and employees may not be involved in decision-making outside of their role’s remit.</p>



<h3>'Woefully behind'</h3>



<p>EUROPE'S DATA-PROTECTION RULEBOOK, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is credited by many for putting privacy on the agenda — especially within company boardrooms, where the fines of 4 percent of global turnover introduced by the legislation are often perceived as an existential threat.</p>



<p>Even so, it was only in late April 2018 — weeks before the regulation came into force — that Amazon created a dedicated team in the information-security department to address the incoming regulation. “The organization was woefully behind,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. Amazon said it had long-standing privacy and security teams and made a standard organizational change to centralize privacy resources in 2018.</p>

<p>The CAMSS driver for Qualcomm Image Signal Processors (ISPs) isn't new, but now has support for the next generation of ISP architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linaro.org/">Linaro</a> has been working together with Qualcomm to enable camera support on
their platformssince 2017. The Open Source CAMSS driver was written to support the ISP IP-block with
the same name that is present on Qualcomm SoCs coming from the smartphone space.</p>
<p>The first development board targeted by this work was the DragonBoard 410C, which was followed in 2018 by
DragonBoard 820C support. Recently support for the Snapdragon 660 SoC was added to the driver,
which will be part of the v5.11 Linux Kernel release. These SoCs all contain the CAMSS
(Camera SubSystem) version of the ISP architecture.</p>
<p>Currently, support for the ISP found in the Snapdragon 845 SoC and the DragonBoard 845C is in
the process of being upstreamed to the mailinglists. Having seen major changes, the ISP is
no longer referred to as CAMSS, but is instead known as Titan.</p>
<p>The Titan architecture offers improvements in resolution, framerates and most other dimensions
of the ISP, and is the latest architecture shipped on modern Qualcomm chipsets.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CAMSS is a V4L2 (Video for Linux 2) Linux driver which focuses on supporting the basic use cases of the ISP,
such as receiving the <a href="https://www.mipi.org/specifications/csi-2">MIPI CSI-2</a> signals from the sensors,
decoding them, and then writing them to memory. This leaves a lot of functionality typically provided
by an ISP unimplemented, but that is intentional as the development priority has been to enable the
data path from camera sensor to userspace.</p>
<p>The sub-components that the CAMSS drivers supports are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CSIPHY - the CSI PHYsical layer manages the physical electrical signals sent by camera sensors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSID - the CSI Decoder decodes the CSI-2 encoded data transmitted by the sensors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VFE - the Video Front End formats received data and exposes it through to further hardware blocks.
The VFE block was renamed to IFE (Image Front End) in the Titan architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RDI - the Raw Dump Interface is exposed by the VFE, and is used to write the raw decoded
CSI output directly to memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PIX - the PIXel interface is exposed by the VFE, and is used to transmit data prepared
for advanced processing by more specialized hardware blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISPIF - the Image Signal Processor InterFace ties together a lot of specialized hardware blocks
into a data pipeline which can provide various levels of additionalprocessing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Qualcomm ISP Gen 1 - CAMSS</h3>
<p>The first generation of the ISP hardware block supported by the (aptly named) CAMSS driver is
called CAMSS by Qualcomm.</p>
<p><a href="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen1.svg"><img alt="Alt text" src="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen1.svg" title="Qualcomm CAMSS ISP Generation 1">
</a></p>
<p>The CSIPHY, CSID &amp; VFE IP-blocks are relatively fully featured, but some functionality like
Virtual Channels are not implemented. However, a more substantial limitation of the ISPIF
support is that only basic cropping and rotation is currently implemented.</p>
<p>An obstacle caused by this limited ISPIF functionality is that it's not able to do format
conversions using the ISP. So whatever format the camera sensor is outputting, is directly
output to userspace. This can be a problem for Bayer pixel format sensors, because
they're poorly supported by userspace applications and require at least debayering to be
done in a post-processing step before the output can be viewed.</p>
<h3>Qualcomm ISP Gen 2 - Titan</h3>
<p>The next iteration of the Qualcomm ISP architecture is called Titan. The changes from Gen1
to Gen2/Titan can be summarized in two parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen2_titan.svg"><img alt="Alt text" src="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen2_titan.svg" title="Qualcomm CAMSS ISP Generation 2, Titan">
</a></p>
<p>The Titan frontend blocks (CSIPHY, CSID &amp; VFE) are almost identical between Gen1 and Gen2
with only minor structural changes and improvements.</p>
<p>However, the image processing pipeline has been revamped, and the ISPIF no longer exists.
What replaces it is an embedded CPU which is fed commands and in turn configures the
data processing blocks. Adding support for this CPU is beyond the current scope
of CAMSS due to the amount of work it would take to enable and the lack of documentation
for the CPU command stream. However, userspace applications are able to manage some of this
post processing. This is enough to support the most basic use cases, but many will be CPU/GPU
intensive and likely not have the same quality as an ISP based implementation would.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Linaro will continue to maintain this driver, and is likely to extend it to support
additional hardware platforms. However, contributions are very welcome and platforms
like the SDM630 and SSDM660 have already had support contributed to the CAMSS driver.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://libcamera.org/index.html">libcamera</a> is a very useful development tool
for working with CAMSS. It is more flexible than most V4L2 applications, and using the
<a href="https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html">libcamera/qcam</a> application makes it possible
to view live output of even Bayer camera sensors without the ISP doing any debayering.</p>
<p>Recent Linaro contributions towards libcamera have enabled GPU accelerated format conversion
and debayering for the <a href="https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html">libcamera/qcam</a> test
application, you can read more about that
<a href="https://www.linaro.org/blog/accelerating-libcamera-qcam-format-conversion-using-opengl-shaders/">here</a>.
Linaro has also contributed the Open Embedded <a href="http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-multimedia/recipes-multimedia/libcamera/libcamera.bb?h=master">libcamera recipe</a>
for developers building their products with Yocto Project based Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Other Linaro contributions to the Linux camera landscape include work in both
userspace with libcamera and in the kernel with camera sensor drivers,
ISP drivers and V4L2 API work.</p>
<p>Further developments regarding software and GPU debayering are expected for libcamera,
and hopefully the community will see libcamera debayering enabled for all of its data paths
soon enough.</p>

<p>Around 6 minutes (1250 words). Published 2021-02-24.</p>


<p>Postgres (or PostgreSQL, if you like) is an amazingly powerful database engine. I’ve recently been working hard on <a href="https://couchers.org/">Couchers.org</a>, and as part of that, I’ve come to really dig into Postgres and understand the incredible value of it. For our use case in an open-source project built by a handful of passionate volunteers, it’s very useful when we don’t need to pull in additional dependencies and complicate the architecture. To this end, we’ve found Postgres to be a really great fit: it just has so much functionality packed right into a stable and well supported package.</p>
<p>As part of implementing text search for Couchers, I’ve spent some time learning about the different ways of going about this using Postgres, so I jotted down some of the basic ideas.</p>
<p>Postgres has two types of text search: full text search, and trigram-based “fuzzy” search. What makes text special is the many idiosyncrasies of our natural language. In most SQL databases, you like to do very straightforward relational queries, <code>SELECT user_id, display_name WHERE username = 'aapeli'</code>, but text is not so easy. There’s a variety of differences that make the problem qutie tricky. Firstly, a word does not always come in the same form, for example <code>Examples!</code> has roughly the same semantic meaning as <code>example</code> (we also have synonyms, but these are much harder). Also, we’re all humans and we make mistakes, so often you will see spelling errors, and it’s nice to have a search engine that can be somewhat resilient to it. One can get away for very basic needs with <code>LIKE</code> and <code>ILIKE</code>, as we did, but it quickly starts limiting the usefulness of search when users really want to find topics of interest. (Note that the trigram module is able to speed up these queries as well through its index.)</p>
<p>This is not a full overview of the power of these tools, rather, it’s a quick teaser and introdution to how they work! I encourage you to go read the full Postgres docs if you find this fascinating, most of the content here is from reading those pages, playing around with these, and implementing a search for Couchers.</p>
<h2 id="full-text-search">Full text search</h2>
<p>Postgres full text search works by trying to <em>normalize</em> words, then match them up exactly. That is, it tires to get around the mesiness of the language by trying to understand it and turn all words with the same semantic meaning into one symbol. These symbols are called <em>lexemes</em> in Postgres. (Each original word may result in multiple lexemes at the end.)</p>
<p>Here’s an example using the default configuration:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.');
      to_tsvector
------------------------
 'exampl':4 'sentenc':5
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Stop words (short words that aren’t useful for search, e.g. ‘this’, ‘is’, ‘an’) are eliminated, punctuation is discarded, and the rest of the words are <em>stemmed</em>, so ‘example’ maps to the lexeme ‘exampl’, and so on. Notice that each lexeme is accompanied with positional information.</p>
<p>This allows indexing large document and matching up words exactly. To query now against this representation, we convert a query string into a <code>tsquery</code>:</p>
<pre><code># select websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 websearch_to_tsquery
----------------------
 'exampl' &amp; 'sentenc'
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>That is, we’re looking for <em>documents</em> whose normalized forms contain both <code>exampl</code> and <code>sentenc</code> (the <code>&amp;</code> signifies logical “and”). Indeed, we get a match:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 ?column?
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search is very language dependent due to the use of language-specific dictionaries. There are a variety of dictionaries available, and Postgres is additionally able to use different standard formats of dictionaries.</p>
<p>In Couchers, we’re currently using English. It’s not therefore good for words that aren’t “Englishy” and not in the dictionary, for example local place names. This causes some headaches for us.</p>
<p>There is a lot more Postgres full text search can do, including weighting different parts of a document (e.g. title, address, content) differently, ranking results with a variety of algorithms, and automatically creating snippets highlighting the matched portions of text. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Read more about these on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use the Postgres A/B/C/D classes for ranking, where each different searchable type has different sets of A/B/C/D. A is normally the title of the entity, e.g. the name of the community, the name of the user (or their username), page title, etc. B is normally the address or the user’s typed in city. C is any other primary text that’s more important than just the content, and D is all other text, main content, and so forth.</p>
<p>We use <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code> to turn an input into a <code>tsquery</code>. It’s safe to use with user-supplied input, and it has the usual web searchy operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>unquoted text requires each word to be in the search</li>
<li>quoted text requries each word to appear consequtively in the text</li>
<li>supports <code>or</code> and <code>-</code> (for negation)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trigram-search-fuzzy-search">Trigram search (fuzzy search)</h2>
<p>Trigram search works by breaking up words into consequtive triplets of characters, then looking these up in an index (though indexing is of course optional). With the right indexes, this scales to insane size and can be even used to implement indexed regular expressions over huge sets of text. Postgres supports this straight out of the box!</p>
<p>The basic search however, just basically needs to count overlapping trigrams.</p>
<p>To get started you need to install the <code>pg_trgm</code> extension which comes pre-packaged with Postgres:</p>
<pre><code># CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION
</code></pre><p>You can then get matching! Here’s an example sentence turned decomposed trigrams:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('This is an example sentence.');
                                                                 show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  a","  e","  i","  s","  t"," an"," ex"," is"," se"," th",amp,"an ","ce ",enc,ent,exa,his,"is ","le ",mpl,nce,nte,ple,sen,ten,thi,xam}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>A search query with a spelling error:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('example sentnences');
                                         show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  e","  s"," ex"," se",apl,ces,enc,ent,"es ",exm,"le ",map,nce,nen,ntn,ple,sen,tne,xma}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Now we can match against it:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('example sentnences', 'This is an example sentence.');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.6666667
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search would not match due to the spelling mistake:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('example sentnences');
 ?column?
----------
 f
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Good on placenames:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('joens', 'Joensuu, Finland');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.8333333
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Trigram search is much better for “fuzzy” matching, but it doesn’t understand text semantics at all, so it’s not ideal for proper full text search or when trying to locate topics in text, and it’s a bit trickier to rank large documents. It can also be a bit tricky to get the indexes right: if a search query results in no trigrams, Postgres falls back to a full table scan… ouch!</p>
<p>However, it should be very good for searching short titles/addresses, and we in Couchers use it against the “A” class from above. Meaning basically that we do this kind of trigram matching against usernames, city names, users’ display names, and so on. Things that don’t generally have a lot of “semantic meaning” and where people easily make typos! <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html">Read more about <code>pg_trgm</code> on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers-1">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use <code>unaccent</code> first on the query and text to be queried to remove accents and normalize text before trigram matching (which discards non-alphanumeric characters). We match against the A list only. We weight trigram similarity a bit higher than the text search results.</p>

        <p><a href="https://architectelevator.com/strategy/complex-topics-stick/">Part 1 of this mini-series</a> described how a good presentation should combine actual experience, mental models, and a punch line, realizing that this model closely maps to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion" target="_blank">Aristotle’s Modes of Persuasion</a> from some 2300 years ago:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ethos: Credibility or authority of the presenter (literally meaning “character”)</li>
  <li>Logos: Reasoning and logical appeal</li>
  <li>Pathos: An appeal to the audience’s emotions (“empathy” is a related term that helps memorizing this one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience adds to ethos because it gives you credibility, mental models use logos to show the audience how pieces relate to each other (one could say, this is “architecture”), and a memorable punch line can stir emotions, such as surprise or humor. Having been around some 2300 years, Aristotle’s model is widely cited and shared, including in my own book.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-alone-dont-make-a-cake">Ingredients Alone Don’t Make a Cake</h2>

<p>To make these elements fruitful in a presentation, they need to be strung together into a flow. Here we encounter the limitations of a simple model like this one that’s included in <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">The Software Architect Elevator</a> in the chapter about Showing Pirate Ships (to figure that one out, you’ll have to go and read <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">the book</a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/presenting_modes_persuasion.png" alt="Modes of persuasion"></p>

<p>This picture is a prototypical model (by now you surely know that I like models): it breaks down a complex topic into its components, abstracting away noise and highlighting the important aspects. One could even say it’s the architecture of a good speech—at least it passes the test of having lines.</p>

<p>However, the model is missing some important aspects. It’s like a recipe that shows us the ingredients but it doesn’t tell much how much of each ingredient we need and how we put them together. It’ll be rather difficult to bake a tasty cake based on a list of ingredients alone (insert my pet peeve about “my architecture is <em>product X</em> and <em>product Y</em>” right here).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upping ethos and pathos from the typical 2% (allocating 96% to logos) to about 20% makes a world of difference for technical presentations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s start with the percentage of ingredients (I’ll leave the putting together for <em>Part 3</em>). The typical technical presentation tends to consist of 96% logos, leaving perhaps 2% each for ethos and pathos, leaving a lot of improvement to balance things out. Shifting things to perhaps 60% logos and 20% ethos and pathos each will make a world of difference. After all, we are still talking about complex technical topics, but we shouldn’t make it a purely technical talk.</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/complex_topics_2_balance.png" alt="Balancing out a technical talk" title="Balancing out a technical talk"></p>

<p>At the same time, technical presentations needn’t be 1/3 each or flip completely the other way, like many Ted talks do. You might be making your IT great again but your audience is likely to want to hear some logos on how exactly that’s going to work.</p>

<h2 id="going-to-extremes">Going to Extremes</h2>

<p>Injecting more logos and pathos into technical presentations has been one of my favorite exercises in my <a href="https://architectelevator.com/workshops">live workshops</a> (I don’t offer them at the moment). To highlight the power of ethos, logos, and pathos, I presented the same argument in three short speeches that turn each dial to “10”, respectively.</p>

<p>Let’s assume your job is to convince people that moving faster is the essential element of your organization’s digital transformation (I do like very realistic examples). Here are three ways to go about this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>The digital world charts new territory with new business models and new ways of interacting with customers. Such novel techniques have to be tested via experiments. Now, it doesn’t do much good if each experiment takes 18 months, therefore moving fast is the most essential property for organizations that are successful in economies of speed.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>We often debate how we can better compete with so-called digital disruptors. Well, after spending over a decade working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, I point to one fundamental advantage those companies have: they are simply moving faster.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>Our company just posted another record quarter. So did Kodak, a few quarters before they went bankrupt. They were simply not moving fast enough. But we don’t have to make the same mistake.</em>”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As you likely guessed correctly, the first snippet is 90% logos (“from A follows B follows C”), the second one 90% ethos (“I was there and am here to tell you”), and version three is pure pathos (“hey, we’re doing great! No, actually we’re doomed. But there’s hope…”).</p>

<p>Going to extremes (bonus points for anyone who was thinking of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QorpDX-GgY" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> by Paul van Dyk with vocals by Jan Johnston) demonstrates that the three elements aren’t just minor variations, but result in completely different speeches. That’s the magic of ethos, logos, and pathos. Digital transformations are the perfect place for such mixes as they are at the intersection of technology and organizational changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethos, logos, and pathos aren’t just minor variations but result in completely different speeches.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="amplifying-ethos-and-pathos">Amplifying Ethos and Pathos</h2>

<p>After understanding the potential of ethos and pathos, it’s useful to know some handy techniques to increase their share in your presentations. It’s like putting more butter and sugar into your cake or your cookies: they can only get better!</p>

<p>The big difference between ethos and pathos is that ethos about you, whereas pathos is mostly about the audience. Let’s start close to home:</p>

<h3 id="more-ethos">More Ethos</h3>

<p>A little ethos goes a long way. It helps overcome the initial hurdle that any presentation must take: convince the audience that listening to you is more valuable than checking email or browsing the web.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experience</strong>: We saw already in part 1 that experience builds ethos. Sharing your experience from a concrete project leaves a stronger impression than an abstract framework.</li>
  <li><strong>Affiliation</strong>: Related, your affiliation (along with titles or degrees) can also impact your ethos. Before you add “ex-Google, ex-ThoughtWorks” to your LinkedIn tag line, remember that this can go both ways–you wouldn’t write “failed at most  big tech companies” either, so it’s all about the dosage (yes, Mr./Mrs. “PMP, PRINCE, CCP, MCTS, MIA”, I am looking at you).</li>
  <li><strong>References</strong>: The experience doesn’t always have to be yours–you can also cite external, credible sources. If <a href="https://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a> / Gartner / Jeff Bezos said it, it must be (mostly) true!</li>
  <li><strong>Appearance</strong>: We shouldn’t base technical credibility on appearance alone but your audience is pre-programmed to form judgment base on your looks and outfit. If you don’t like it, you might need to have a work with the ultimate chief architect, or just accept it. For example, who would want to question <a href="https://handbookofsoftwarearchitecture.com/about/" target="_blank">Grady Booch’s credibility about architecture</a>?</li>
  <li><strong>Speech Patterns</strong>: Some have observed my annoyance with the fact that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/naturally-selected/201306/the-sound-leader-ceos-deep-voices-do-better" target="_blank">deep voices make speakers more credible</a>. Not only does it amplify gender bias, but I also end up listening to deep, slow voices far too often. But before you get the vocoder out, there are more subtle ways to boost a bit of ethos. For example, slowing down your pace, pausing, or varying your vocal patterns can also make you appear more authoritative.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-pathos">More Pathos</h3>

<p>Pathos is about your audience: many speakers are very excited about their topic but the audience isn’t. That’s not pathos, but pathetic. First, I tend to remind technical speakers of the breadth of emotions that we can feel, in case one or two became forgotten while typing code into a text editor all day. A nice way to illustrate emotions is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik" target="_blank">Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/plutchik-wheel.svg" alt="Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions"></p>

<p>In my little speech above I used at least four emotions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I began with <em>pride</em> and <em>optimism</em></li>
  <li>Next, I gave the audience a <em>surprise</em></li>
  <li>Then I triggered <em>fear</em></li>
  <li>I conclude with <em>hope</em> and <em>anticipation</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Not all pathos relies on strong, one-dimensional emotions like these. There are many simple techniques to “liven up” technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stories and Anecdotes</strong>: stories used to be the way knowledge was passed for millennia, so humans are well attuned to listening to stories. Watch people cry when watching a move - that’s the power of pathos. Again, success lies in the balance - some people feel that they need to package their technical content into a long heart-wrenching story. That’ll surely miss many people’s (surely mine!) marks. So think about short anecdotes more than long-winded stories. You don’t want your core messages gone with the wind…</li>
  <li><strong>Analogies and Metaphors</strong>: Analogies allow you to relate your mental models (logos!) to something the audience is already familiar with and often has positive associations with (pathos!). One of my favorite examples is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEeIG8aPPk" target="_blank">short speech by the late Russ Ackoff</a> on continual improvement. Almost each statement he makes about complex systems is related back to the automobile (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=252">4:12</a>) or the human body (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=274" target="_blank">4:34</a>)  - notice the audience’s emotion as they are listening to an academic talk about complex systems theory.</li>
  <li><strong>Concrete Figures</strong>: Even little things like replacing words like “big”, “sizable”, or “many” with concrete figures can make a presentation more relatable. So, next time you talk about scalability, reference the customer who had “thousands” of microservices and had to manage “several hundred” custom VMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Punch Lines</strong>: We saw in Part 1 that short, memorable punchlines or slogans can also stir emotions, and such boost pathos. “Don’t run software you didn’t build” is more pathos than “a modern enterprise prefers a SaaS model of cloud computing for COTS applications”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-right-kind-of-pathos">The Right Kind of Pathos</h3>

<p>Not all emotions are positive, though. Remember Plutchik’s wheel: there you’ll find contempt, loathing, rage, and sadness. That’s not the kind of pathos you’re going to want to inject into your audience. Therefore, here a (likely incomplete) list of techniques that avoid some of the biggest emotional pitfalls in technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Arrogance</strong>: Most people listen to you because you can tell them that they don’t …</li></ul></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7335da67b70b5bec65dc"><div><p>Charlie Munger answered questions for two hours today at the 2021 Daily Journal Annual Meeting. The topics ranged from the current investing environment to worldly wisdom, and there was something to learn for everyone. Three insights stood out in particular:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Current Stock Market Speculation/GameStop/Robinhood/Reddit</strong></p><p><span>Charlie Munger’s view:</span> “These kind of things [referring to recent speculation in GameStop’s stock] happen when a whole bunch of people use the public stock markets instead of betting on horse races. […]I think that you should make money by selling people things that are good for them. When you have these brokerage houses luring people to gamble in the markets and then skimming off the top that is not good. This must end badly, but I don't know when. […]Nobody should believe that Robinhood's trades are free. It's a dishonorable way to talk.”</p><p><span>My thoughts:</span> We are experiencing an extreme mania in areas of the market encouraged by brokers and social media “influencers.” Just pause and think for a second: why would any self-respecting serious investor go out and post stock advice/tips on social media to a broad audience? And what does people telling each other to have “diamond hands” and to “hold the line” have to do with investing? An old proverb comes to mind: “Those who know do not speak and those who speak do not know.” And if you are really investing rather than blindly gambling (or worse, running an illegal stock market pool), then why does it make any difference to your investment conclusion what some random anonymous person on an internet forum is doing with respect to the stock in which you are invested?</p><p>I have little doubt that looking back on this a few years from now we will rate rank amateurs dumping their savings/stimulus checks/who knows what other funds into the abyss of market speculation up there with other manias of the last couple of centuries. The likely feeling looking back will be of bewilderment and pity for the thousands of regular folks who came under its influence. As Charlie said, however, when it will end nobody knows. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Value Investing in the Current Environment</strong></p><p><span>Charlie Munger’s view:</span> “I don't think we have a bubble in Treasury securities, I just don't think they are a good investment and I have not been buying any at these rates. […] I don't think it's crazy that good companies are trading at higher P/E ratios when we have low interest rates. […] All intelligent investing is value investing the way I define it, which is getting more for your money than you pay. Some people look for value in strong companies and others look for it among weak companies.”</p><p><span>My thoughts:</span> The whole “<a href="https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/value-investing-works">does value investing still work” debate</a> has been getting a bit worn. People who really understand value investing understand that of course it still works, just that the areas where opportunities are shift around. They also understand that value investing is really about a thoughtful comparison of price with an intrinsic value derived from careful fundamental analysis of the business, the management team and the balance sheet. Anything else is just speculation. </p><p>That being said, <a href="https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/value-investors-missing-growth">value investing can be applied to a wide range of companies</a>, depending on your own circle of competence. The reason for all these recent doubts have more to do with the exuberant stock market action of the last few years than with fundamental change in that reality. When bubble-like behavior in parts of the stock market dies down, as it always does, the inquiry will shift again to the much more useful question of how should you, given your strengths, weaknesses and circumstances, practice investing.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614223351198_20932"><div><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Learning</strong></p><p><span>Charlie Munger’s view:</span> “People have a theory that any good hardworking person can be a great investor. I think they can be a pretty good investor and avoid certain pitfalls but they can't necessarily be a great investors. […]I had the right temperament [for learning]. And when someone gave me a good idea, I quickly adopted it and used it all my life. It's hard to teach. To some extent you either have it or you don't. […] What advice would I give to someone trying to stay within their circle of competence but who is finding it being rapidly shrunk by new technology? You fix what can be fixed and what can't be fixed you endure.”</p><p><span>My thoughts:</span> People have different capacity for learning. Ingrained traits, likes stubbornness, ego and many others get in the way. Warren Buffett has done so well in large part because he learned and evolved, decade after decade. Many lesser investors have become “kings of a small hill” – they learned an approach that worked for a time but never evolved it and lost some of their excellence when their approach became less successful due to the changing environment.</p><p>One of the best resources on and examples of learning that I know of is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465">Josh Waitzkin’s “The Art of Learning.”</a> Josh has achieved the International Master title in chess at a young age… and then proceeded to train and become a Tai Chi champion. Either of those two accomplishments is hard enough, but for one person to do both suggests that they are on to something and that we should pay attention to their method.</p><p>And finally, for the “half” that the title of this article promised, which is perhaps more valuable than all of the rest:</p><p><span>Charlie Munger:</span> “The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have expectations that are too high you will have a miserable life. When you have reverses you need to just cope and not stew yourself into unnecessary misery. […] Most people are born with a ‘happy stat,’ and they wouldn't be much happier almost no matter what their outcome in life would have been.”</p><p><span>My thoughts:</span> To borrow Charlie’s phrase that he is so well-known for: I have nothing to add.</p><p><em>Note: All quotes from Charlie Munger are based on my notes and best recollections from listening to Charlie speak, and are likely to contain small errors which I hope do not change his intended meaning.</em></p><p><em>If you are interested in learning more about the investment process at Silver Ring Value Partners, you can&nbsp;</em><a href="https://silverringvaluepartners.com/ip-overview-1/" title="https://silverringvaluepartners.com/ip-overview-1/" target="_blank"><strong><em>request an Owner’s Manual here</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to watch </em><strong><em>educational videos that can help you </em></strong><em>make better investing decisions using the principles of value investing and behavioral finance, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GaryMishuris?sub_confirmation=1" title="https://www.youtube.com/c/GaryMishuris?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank"><strong><em>check out my YouTube channel</em></strong></a><em> where I regularly post new content.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    
<p>I mainly wrote this blog post to help advertise Shopify as a great place to intern at, but I'm sure all of these aspects can be found at other great companies, though maybe not all at one company/team. I recommend this blog post not only for those looking to apply to Shopify, but to know how great internships can be and what qualities you would want from an internship. </p>
<p>I'm currently writing this in my last week at Shopify as I have decided to go elsewhere full-time, though I still love Shopify enough that I chose to intern there over joining a YCombinator cohort! It is a very special place to be, which is also why I returned three times (started interning at Shopify in Summer 2018). </p>
<h2 id="flexibility">flexibility<a href="#flexibility" aria-label="Anchor link for: flexibility"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This is an underlying factor in a lot of other things I'll talk about, but I like that Shopify doesn't often have "rules" for anything. Shopify let me do two (two month) internships to accommodate for my two-month summers. They also let me work part-time after I graduated! Most importantly, they don't require interns to be enrolled in a bachelor's degree program bringing epic diversity to intern classes from people with degrees in other fields or former chefs. I got the same epic flexibility at Hatch Canada, working part-time and being allowed to work on projects of my choosing.</p>
<h2 id="room-to-do-all-the-learning">room to do all the learning<a href="#room-to-do-all-the-learning" aria-label="Anchor link for: room-to-do-all-the-learning"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I'd say I'm three times better of a programmer than I was when I started at Shopify. It happen partially through the classic "learning on the job". By building applications and getting code reviews from coworkers I became a better programmer. However, I think the key that made learning on the job effective was being able to ask a shitload of questions. Shopify was good at building an environment where I felt I could do that without feeling like I was asking bad questions or bothering anyone. This let me spend less time confused, make better decisions, learn about things I could apply in the future (or just sate curiosity).</p>
<p>Another great thing is that I had the room to dedicate time to learning. That included working through a book, reading papers or attending conferences. Shopify funded me buying textbooks and I felt alright taking a day to read up on a subject. I often spent time going down rabbit holes of reading even after completing a task. I was approved to go to Japan for a conference (cancelled due to COVID-19) and spent a day attending a workshop on VMs (didn't even bother getting approval for that).</p>
<p>Learning is good. Especially in internships, your focus should be investing in yourself and great companies should want to invest in you (within reason of course).</p>
<h2 id="impact">impact<a href="#impact" aria-label="Anchor link for: impact"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of companies end up giving interns a special project of sorts. While the project may be substantial, interesting and potentially impactful, they often get iced as soon as the intern leaves. This may not be valuable to <em>everyone</em>, but at Shopify I was apart of the weekly sprints and worked on producing features and fixes that other engineers were actually relying on. Not having intern projects would also help you better understand how much you'd enjoy working at a company full-time. The downside of course, is that you might not actually have anything to call "your own" and you will lose engineering time to things like planning meetings (which are important and fun too!). But then... the next section.</p>
<h2 id="being-a-champion">being a champion<a href="#being-a-champion" aria-label="Anchor link for: being-a-champion"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>For my third internship at Shopify, I switched from the Facebook team to a neighbouring team with people I had worked with in the past (so it was still fairly familiar). It was a bit weird, as for those four months I'd be working part-time at 20 hours a week. This would make it hard for me to be involved in day-to-day work, especially with it being Black Friday Cyber Monday (huge week for Shopify). So, I went on to champion my own project where I extended an open source app into being able to generate code (Rails and NodeJS) to build Marketing Activity extensions. This meant that I was the lead on the project, and was responsible for informing stakeholders on the status. I interacted with numerous teams and became the "person to go to" for information on the project. Yes, there was a risk of it ending up more like an intern project, but that's why it was also apart of the job to communicate with other teams and do health checks to make sure the project was ontrack and useful. Though it was not a huge project, it was exciting, impactful and "my own"!</p>

</h2>
<p>My first four months at Shopify were on the Facebook Ads / Instagram Checkout team, where we worked on an application for Shopify merchants to be able to directly advertise on Facebook through Shopify and to sell products via Instagram. Throughout my time there, I not only worked with the Facebook API but was in contact with Facebook engineers about goals and for technical support. The Facebook team also flew in to work with us and have social events, which was pretty fun! These experiences were unique, and helped me exercise some remote-working communication skills (which are really being tested during this quarantine).</p>
<h2 id="writing-for-an-engineering-blog">writing for an engineering blog<a href="#writing-for-an-engineering-blog" aria-label="Anchor link for: writing-for-an-engineering-blog"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my current internship, I wrote a blog post about the first PR I shipped. The Engineering Blog doesn't have any special barrier for interns submitting work - if you did something cool, you can write about it! Through writing the post, I was able to talk to some cool folks on the Eng Comms team and sharpen my shoddy writing skills. My post now lives on <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/optimizing-ruby-lazy-initialization-in-truffleruby-with-deoptimization">Shopify Engineering Blog</a>! It was great exposure for a personal brand to, as the post made it to the top post of Hacker News and stayed on the front page for over twelve hours.</p>
<h2 id="people-who-really-care">people who really care<a href="#people-who-really-care" aria-label="Anchor link for: people-who-really-care"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the aspect I think Shopify is likely most special for, and the reason I was most afraid to leave Shopify. I always felt like my team members and lead had my best interests, and wanted to make sure that I felt productive and happy at Shopify. Weekly 1:1s, frequent kind words and so many other things really brought this together. Our CTO reached out to me to compliment me for my blog post. When the company went remote due to COVID-19, I got a personal message from my Director making sure that I was doing alright (which was ridiculous because he was dealing with being quarantined with kids) along with a little casual chat. Shopify didn't even let go of culinary workers when we went remote. The list could go on! Choosing to leaving Shopify was a really emotional experience (I cried when verbally turning down the offer) because of all the kindness, patience and care people there have offered me.</p>
<hr>
<p>So keep an eye out for Shopify internships postings, and go do internships in general! Internships at Shopify run three times a year (January, May, September) for 4 to 8 months. Applications open 4 months before start dates~</p>
<p>Feel free to email me (<code>hello@carolchen.me</code>) with any questions about choosing internships, or questions about working at Shopify or anything! Courage to talk to strangers on the internet will earn you my respect &lt;3. However, please try to avoid questions along the lines of "how do I get an internship?" as quite frankly I don't have insight beyond knowing exactly what I did (some of which I have forgotten). Requests for resume reviews, for example, is something I could actually help out with.</p>

<p>On <em>2021-02-24</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Recently I <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8387">fixed a
bug</a> in
librealsense2<sup id="reference-1"><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>. The
core of the bug was that the developers used a C++ functional cast expression
in a C header (C does not have functional cast expressions!), which broke the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision-oss/realsense-rust">realsense-rust</a> wrapper
we’re developing at work. Worse yet, this was shipped as part of the official
2.42.0 release of librealsense2. Oof.</p>

<p>The fix is pretty clear: use a C-style cast instead. Better yet, follow the
advice in <a href="https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/">Modern C</a> and don’t use casts at
all.  We can’t always avoid them though, and the compiler can make the whole
process annoying. At least, it becomes annoying and difficult to detect such
issues when you use a C++ compiler.</p>



<p>I’ve shipped an SDK before myself, and that ended up getting me thinking: I
reject the premise of the fix in the first place. This code <em>shouldn’t</em> be
broken, and it is frustrating that it is. The real sin here was shipping inline
functions in a public header for C code.</p>

<h2 id="inlining-code-in-c--c">Inlining code in C / C++</h2>

<p>If that’s confusing, let me expand briefly. Inlining code is a common trick for
trying to improve the performance of code by having the compiler copy the
implementation of a function and apply it in place (with no additional stack
frame). This can improve performance of small code sections, and is critical in
optimizing tight loops that centre around small functions. I’d go into extreme
depth, but <a href="https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/">Modern C</a><sup id="reference-2"><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup> actually has an entire
section on this, and it explains it a lot better (look for section 15.1 on
inlining functions).</p>

<p>Anyways, the trade-off of inlining functions is that you typically have to
place them in the header; alternatively, in the same source file they’re used
in if you’re not exposing the <code>inline</code>‘d function publicly. Note that this is
entirely about “performance” and not “ergonomics” or “making it easier to
code.”</p>

<p>In the scenario where I had to fix the bug above though, there’s a few
differences. Rather than directly inlining the functions, the author of the
code chose to make them <code>static</code> instead. This behaves somewhat similarly to
inlining the code directly but it isn’t exact. In this case, the <code>static</code>
functions in that <code>rsutil.h</code> header:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can end up being instantiated separately in every translation unit (if
they’re too big to inline).</li>
  <li>Will make taking a function pointer to any of those functions behave
“strangely.” Since that function will be local to each translation unit,
taking the pointer of such a function will result in a different pointer for
each translation unit.</li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose the first problem above is a small trade-off as long as the code
works the same, but the second one is definitely not something you expect.
Particularly, this header is shipped as a C header to librealsense2’s C-API. If
you understand C by reading the header, you’ll probably notice the subtle
difference, but even still it’s not something that sits at the front of your
mind, and may surprise you if you rely on this header in many places and decide
to use the function pointer.</p>

<p>Eventually C introduced the <code>inline</code> keyword to specifically handle these
trade-offs when defining functions this way. Thus, you can get the performance
improvement of inlining small functions without the above problems with
<code>static</code> functions. However, even if we swap out the <code>static</code> keyword for
<code>inline</code> we aren’t really solving the underlying problem at all.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-issue-inline-definitions-not-the-inline-keyword">The real issue: inline definitions, not the <code>inline</code> keyword</h2>

<p>The real issue is having those definitions in the header in the first place. By
having all that code in your header, you’re shipping a dependency that is
basically promising “this code will not break on your compiler.” You don’t know
what compiler you’re shipping to; even if your ABI is stable you still have to
worry about what standard the language supports, what extensions are available,
etc. Inlined definitions are often done best if your code isn’t likely to
change ever if at all, but here you can’t be sure.</p>

<p>If you take away anything from this, it should be the importance of not
breaking downstream code because of inline definitions. By defining another C
file and moving these definitions out of the header, you would probably lose
very little, while making it easier to generate FFI bindings in other
languages, as well as allow your end users using C to well… use C.</p>

<p>This ended up breaking the FFI generation by bindgen in Rust for us, because
the inlined definition changed (and changed to something that wasn’t standard
C). That said, it’s just a bad idea overall. Most of these functions are quite
large already, so chances that the compiler inlines them directly (especially
without the <code>inline</code>) keyword are small. Moreover, most people doing
performance critical code with functions like <code>rs2_project_to_pixel</code> or
<code>rs2_project_color_pixel_to_depth_pixel</code> are unlikely to be banking on the fact
that your utility functions are getting inlined and operating at max
efficiency. Just put the definitions in their own file, and only inline the
code when you can clearly benchmark and measure a strong use-case for doing so.
Above all else, make sure you understand the language you’re shipping to when
you make that change.</p>



<p>I certainly disagree with the way the code is structured here, but its not an
easy problem. It also isn’t something that stems from bad developers, so I
can’t accuse Intel of brash incompetence. What likely happened here is that the
engineer who made the original change works in C++ for 99% of their work day,
and only touches the C headers occasionally when they get tired of compiler
warnings or if something significant changes at a lower layer. It’s really easy
to make this mistake, even if you do commit to best practices (thanks C!).</p>

<p>At the heart of the issue, working on an SDK is hard and often thankless.  I
suggest any team that might be shipping C headers take the above advice, and
take care to watch that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C is not C++, and you should compile your C-API with a C compiler</li>
  <li><code>inline</code> is an effective tool for performance, not an easy way to avoid
committing another <code>.c</code> file to your repo.</li>
  <li>a <code>static</code> storage class on functions means something specific, and has
downsides when used the same way as <code>inline</code>.</li>
  <li>you should not inline your function definitions in headers you ship publicly
for a library! This breaks everyone downstream who is using an FFI or
relying on C because they can’t use C++!</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p id="footnote-1">
<a href="#reference-1">[1]</a> We do use Rust at <a href="https://tangramvision.com/">Tangram Visions</a>, but sometimes we still have to
understand C and C++ to be able to interface with existing code.
</p>

<p id="footnote-2">
<a href="#reference-2">[2]</a> I can't say enough good things about this book.
C is complicated in a lot of ways, but if you break things down piece-by-piece
you'll find it's actually way less bad than many make it out to be. I still
love Rust &amp; its type system significantly more, but I've worked in C / C++ in
the past, so I know from experience where things can start to go awry.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, I highly suggest giving the book a read, you'll probably learn
something! Jens Gustedt is very well informed and while some opinions (e.g.
don't use casts) are likely to start a flame war, I tend to find myself
agreeing with the final assessment.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There is work in progress to bring compact debug type information into the kernel, which will be leveraged by <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> to get it to the next level in terms of developer experience and capabilities. We developed an algorithm that compresses <strong>124MB</strong> of DWARF type data into just <strong>1.5MB</strong> of compact BTF type data, making it suitable to be included in the Linux kernel image by default.</p>
<!--truncate-->

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> is a technology that allows unprecedented ability to execute custom external code <strong>safely</strong> inside the Linux kernel in response to various events/hooks. This enables all kinds of applications, that are either impossible or expensive to achieve by other means (e.g., low-overhead profiling and tracing, rich introspection, fast custom packet processing, etc.).</p>
<p>While the BPF technology is already very capable and is constantly being developed further, the current developer experience with it is not exactly a walk in the park yet. One way to smooth out the developer experience with BPF is through better introspection and debuggability of BPF code. To allow that, BPF needs to know a bunch of metadata information about the BPF program. Type information is one of a few critical pieces of metadata necessary to bring the BPF experience to the next level. Eventually, this metadata will enable not just introspection, but also much higher levels of re-usability of BPF code across different versions of the Linux kernel (the so-called "compile once, run everywhere" approach).</p>
<p>How is such metadata represented in normal, non-BPF programs? It's typically done through <a href="http://www.dwarfstd.org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF.pdf">DWARF</a> debug information. The problem with DWARF though, is that it's very generic and expressive, which makes it a quite complicated and verbose format, and thus unsuitable to include in the Linux kernel image due to size overhead and the complexity of parsing it.</p>
<p>Enter BTF (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg226733.html">BPF Type Format</a>). It's a minimalistic, compact format, inspired by Sun's CTF (Compact C Type Format), which is used for representing kernel debug information since Solaris 9. BTF was created for similar purposes, with a focus on simplicity and compactness to allow its usage in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>We won't describe BTF in a lot of detail here—see the links above to get complete information. Suffice it to say that BTF represents each type with one of a few possible type descriptors identified by <em>kind</em>: <code>BTF_KIND_INT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ENUM</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_STRUCT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_UNION</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ARRAY</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_PTR</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_CONST</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_VOLATILE</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_RESTRICT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_TYPEDEF</code>—a few more might be added soon for functions support. Depending on the kind, there might be additional variable-sized information available. Some kinds of types can reference other types using their type IDs (e.g., <code>int*</code> type is two type descriptors: <code>PTR</code> → <code>INT</code>). The type descriptor's ID is its position in the input array of all descriptors. BTF type information is stored in <code>.BTF</code> ELF section, which contains two parts: BTF type descriptors, followed by <code>\0</code>-separated strings section.</p>
<p><img src="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/assets/btf-dedup-example.png" alt="Sample C code and its corresponding BTF type graph"></p>
<p>The diagram above should give a pretty good idea of the BTF type graph. It shows some C source code on the left and its corresponding BTF type graph on the right. The type with ID 0 is special, it represents <code>void</code> and is implicit: the first type descriptor in the <code>.BTF</code> section has type ID 1. In all the diagrams  in this blog post, type IDs are written out in the top-left corner of each type node. Type references are marked with arrows. For structs/unions it should be obvious from the diagrams which field references which type. Note that type nodes are shown in two different colors: green for non-reference types, and red for reference once (this distinction will be explained further below).</p>
<p>A well-known (within the kernel community) tool, <code>pahole</code>, was recently updated with the ability to convert DWARF into corresponding BTF type information in a straightforward, one-to-one fashion. It iterates over each DWARF type descriptor, converts it trivially into a BTF type descriptor and embeds all of them into the <code>.BTF</code> section in the ELF binary. Simple and easy. We're done, right? Unfortunately, not yet.</p>
<p>DWARF information is emitted by the compiler for each compilation unit (CU) (e.g., in the C/C++ world that is a single compiled .c/.cpp file) independently and in isolation from other compilation units that form the resulting binary. This means that DWARF information within a single CU has to describe all types referenced directly and indirectly (e.g., through struct fields) by code within that CU, down to primitive types like <code>int</code> and <code>long</code>. DWARF data from all CUs is then concatenated by the linker and put into the resulting binary <code>.debug_info</code> (and a few other) ELF sections. As you can imagine, this results in a great duplication of type information. For instance, for the kernel image on my machine, DWARF type data (<code>.debug_info</code> section) takes 121.31MB and strings (<code>.debug_str</code> section) take another 2.68MB. After <code>pahole</code>'s DWARF-to-BTF conversion there are 3.15 million BTF type descriptors: BTF type data takes 101.7MB, and strings take an additional 3.03MB.</p>
<p>There are still other problems though. The same type hierarchy (e.g., struct and all the types that struct references) can be represented in DWARF/BTF to various degrees of completeness (or rather, incompleteness) due to struct/union forward declarations.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example, that we'll use throughout this note to better understand the problem and solution. Suppose we have two compilation units, each using same <code>struct S</code>, but each of them having incomplete type information about struct's fields:</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};




<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of CU #1, DWARF (and subsequently, BTF) data will know only that <code>struct B</code> (but no other) exists, but will know the complete type information about <code>struct A</code>. While for CU #2, it will know the full type information about <code>struct B</code>, but will only know about the forward declaration of <code>struct A</code> (in BTF terms, it will have <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code> type descriptor with name <code>B</code>).</p>
<p>This compilation unit isolation means that it's possible there is no single CU with complete type information describing structs <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code>. Also, we might get tons of duplicated and redundant type information. Unfortunately, for BPF use cases that are going to rely on BTF data, it's important to have a single and complete type information per each unique type, without any duplicates and incompleteness.</p>
<p>That means we need to have an algorithm, that would take this duplicated and potentially incomplete BTF information and emit nicely deduplicated type information, while also "reconstructing" complete type information by merging pieces of it from different CUs. Such BTF data can then be embedded into the Linux kernel image and readily utilized by both the kernel itself (e.g., by BPF verifier for more advanced verification scenarios), as well as external tooling to allow types introspection and better debugging capabilities.</p>
<p>Additional complications we need to keep in mind come from the fact that types, in general, can form graphs containing cycles, not just DAGs. The example above has few type cycles, which we'll use as an opportunity to better demonstrate in subsequent sections how the algorithm works. Type cycles are very common in real programs: they're typical for linked list nodes, but any moderately complex program probably would form much more complicated cycles. The Linux kernel's <code>struct task_struct</code> is part of pretty big connected type graph with multiple cycles!</p>
<p>So, in summary, we need an algorithm that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>deduplicate redundant BTF information and leave single instance of each unique type;</li>
<li>merge and reconstruct complete type information across multiple CUs;</li>
<li>handle type cycles correctly and efficiently;</li>
<li>do all of the above fast and reliably to become a part of Linux kernel build process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This note describes one such BTF deduplication (or "dedup", for short) algorithm.</p>

<p>The BTF dedup algorithm takes as an input an in-memory blob representing <code>.BTF</code> ELF section with all BTF type descriptors and string data, that comes separately from descriptors. It overwrites that memory in-place with deduplicated types and strings without any loss of information.</p>
<p>While the algorithm does deduplication, it also merges and resolves type information, whenever possible. For instance, in the example above with two compilation units having partial type information for structs <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the output of the algorithm will emit a single copy of each BTF type that describes structs <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>S</code> (as well as type information for <code>int</code> and pointers), as if they were defined in a single compilation unit (see the diagram below for a visual representation of input and expected output BTF type graphs):</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Algorithm summary</h2>
<p>The algorithm completes its work in five separate passes, which we'll describe briefly here and in detail in subsequent sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strings deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate string data, re-write all string offsets in BTF type descriptors to simplify string comparisons later.</li>
<li><strong>Non-reference types deduplication:</strong> Establish equivalence between and deduplicate integer, enum, struct, union and forward types.</li>
<li><strong>Reference types deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate pointers, const/volatile/restrict modifiers, typedefs, and array.</li>
<li><strong>Type compaction:</strong> Compact type descriptors leaving only unique ones.</li>
<li><strong>Type IDs fix up:</strong> Update all referenced type IDs with new ones established during compaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few important ideas and data structures the algorithm relies on, which are critical to understanding it and would be useful to keep …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I re-made my site with Eleventy, the pages didn't change much, but I had loads of fun adding new features. The most fun was <strong>webmentions</strong> and I'm here to convince you to add them!</p><p>First, let me step back and explain why webmentions exist—the IndieWeb.</p><p>Check out this official description of the IndieWeb:</p><blockquote><p>The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data—<strong>indieweb.org</strong></p></blockquote><p>So, a community of personal websites, connected together, used as identities, that makes ownership of data possible. 🦄 🌈 How does this all work?</p><ul><li>There's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/">great IndieWeb resource</a> that will tell you everything you need to know</li><li>But, start here if you want to know <a href="https://indieweb.org/why">why the IndieWeb deserves your attention</a></li><li>When you're convinced, see this handy page for a <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">quick start to becoming a citizen of the IndieWeb</a></li><li>International IndieWebCamps are here to help—I wrote a <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/indiewebcamp/">post about my first IndieWebCamp visit</a><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/indiewebcamp2017.png" alt="Nuernberg IndieWebCamp 2017"><figcaption>Nürnberg IndieWebCamp 2017 (I'm in the bottom right)</figcaption></figure></li></ul><p>Now the juicy stuff!</p><p>I think the coolest thing about the IndieWeb is that it is decentralised. Currently, there is a handful of corporations that own much of our data. With webmentions, each person owns their own data and each person can communicate with others. Webmentions are basically a way to display on your personal site ways that others have interacted with your content.</p><p>On my site I display mentions and bookmarks. It's possible for someone to link to one of my blog posts within one of their blog posts or bookmarks. If they do this, I won't know about it unless they let me know about it. <a href="https://webmention.app/">Letting others know you've mentioned their posts can be done manually or can be automated</a>.</p><p>I also display likes, retweets and replies on blog posts that I have tweeted about. If the URL to my post is in my tweet, I can gather the interactions on that tweet and display them on that post. Although most social media platforms do not support webmentions, it's possible to gather them by using a great free service called <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a>.</p><p>Some people have had webmentions on their site for many years, so I am a bit behind. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6495">Jeremy has had webmentions since 2013</a>. But, there are more people posting content online than ever before, and personal websites aren't shown the love they used to get.</p><p>So, there has never been a more pressing need to put content creation platforms (e.g. Medium) and social media platforms (e.g. Twitter) second, and put your very own little corner of the web first 💖</p><p>I used Max Böck's post on <a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/">using webmentions in Eleventy</a> to get started. I was able to get something on the screen quickly with Max's advice, and then I refined the incoming data a bit. Here is a summary of what I did:</p><ul><li>Sign up via <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> - if this doesn't work right away, check out ways to <a href="https://indielogin.com/setup">set up your website for indie logins</a> (I'm able to sign in by linking to my GitHub account on my site's homepage)</li><li>Add two <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to your HTML document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element: <code>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/xmlrpc"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/webmention"&gt;</code></li><li>For social media mentions, sign up to <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a></li><li>Fetch <strong>all</strong> of your site's webmention data in JSON format using one of the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">webmention endpoints described by IndieWebCamp co-founder Aaron Parecki</a> and the API token provided by <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a></li><li>Shape your webmention data however you like - I filter webmentions into separate re-tweet, reply, like, mention, and bookmark functions using the <code>'wm-property'</code> (check out the <a href="https://github.com/ambrwlsn/website/blob/1d713ad9fbce19a9bd8821790fd51c1be62e1f76/src/filters/webmentions-filter.js#L51">filter functions</a> and before you say anything, yes I know they could be DRYer)</li><li>Use the data to display webmentions on your blog posts</li></ul><p>Here are some of my webmentions (from <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/from-gatsby-to-eleventy/">my Gatsby to Eleventy post</a>):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/webmentions.png" alt="Amber's webmentions on her Gatsby to Eleventy post"></p><p>If all of this seems too difficult and inaccessible, please don't give up! I thought getting webmentions on my little static site would be <strong>way too difficult</strong>. But there are so many wonderful posts about setting up webmentions, and so many great people willing to help. I count myself as one of those people :) If you want to implement webmentions on your site and are stuck on any of the points I listed above, ping me on Twitter and I'll do my best to help out.</p></div></div>]]>

Or, more generically, a “platform” anyway? What’s so unique about these things that we need to give them fancy names to differentiate them from other things (objects?)?</p><p id="3cb9">In someways I personally believe that “social network” or “social media” are a semi-redundant description in today’s parlence because these ideas seem to be implied as the defacto standard for any <em>“web two dot zero plus” </em>platform. But for the sake of completeness I will discuss these ideas and I’ll take my readers down the rabbit hole of internet history once again as I do so.</p><p id="c6bb">In defining and discussing important notions of social networks and platforms, I will borrow some ideas from the infamous <a href="https://medium.com/u/c1ec701babb7?source=post_page-----7b08ce57bdff--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Yegge</a>, and the one and only <a href="https://medium.com/u/13be457aed12?source=post_page-----7b08ce57bdff--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Kleppmann</a> for ideas related to “local first” data, as well as, to help the user to better understand some of the technical notions of a truly distrubuted data platform (Martin literally wrote the book on this!).</p><p id="ad96">I will link the the infamous Yegge rants which I happen to keep a copy of at <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdheller/9742228a7c03cebb7ddd2dc1aebe1bdf" rel="noopener">my personal github</a> but I think the most important part of the discussion (for our purposes) can be found below:</p><blockquote><p id="4698">That one last thing that Google doesn’t do well is Platforms. We don’t understand platforms. We don’t “get” platforms. Some of you do, but you are the minority. This has become painfully clear to me over the past six years. I was kind of hoping that competitive pressure from Microsoft and Amazon and more recently Facebook would make us wake up collectively and start doing universal services. Not in some sort of ad-hoc, half-assed way, but in more or less the same way Amazon did it: all at once, for real, no cheating, and treating it as our top priority from now on.</p><p id="feb6">But no. No, it’s like our tenth or eleventh priority. Or fifteenth, I don’t know. It’s pretty low. There are a few teams who treat the idea very seriously, but most teams either don’t think about it all, ever, or only a small percentage of them think about it in a very small way.</p><p id="d363">It’s a big stretch even to get most teams to offer a stubby service to get programmatic access to their data and computations. Most of them think they’re building products. And a stubby service is a pretty pathetic service. Go back and look at that partial list of learnings from Amazon, and tell me which ones Stubby gives you out of the box. As far as I’m concerned, it’s none of them. Stubby’s great, but it’s like parts when you need a car.</p><p id="16ca">A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.</p><p id="0dac">Google+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry, Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo). We all don’t get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: “So is it the Stalker API?” She got all glum and said “Yeah.” I mean, I was joking, but no… the only API call we offer is to get someone’s stream. So I guess the joke was on me.</p><p id="8313">Microsoft has known about the Dogfood rule for at least twenty years. It’s been part of their culture for a whole generation now. You don’t eat People Food and give your developers Dog Food. Doing that is simply robbing your long-term platform value for short-term successes. Platforms are all about long-term thinking.</p><p id="0f24">Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that’s not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there’s something there for everyone.</p><p id="9209">Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: “Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let’s go contract someone to, um, write some games for us.” Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now? The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.</p><p id="dce8">You can’t do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don’t have a Steve Jobs here. I’m sorry, but we don’t.</p><p id="642d">Larry Tesler may have convinced Bezos that he was no Steve Jobs, but Bezos realized that he didn’t need to be a Steve Jobs in order to provide everyone with the right products: interfaces and workflows that they liked and felt at ease with. He just needed to enable third-party developers to do it, and it would happen automatically.</p><p id="bc51">I apologize to those (many) of you for whom all this stuff I’m saying is incredibly obvious, because yeah. It’s incredibly frigging obvious. Except we’re not doing it. We don’t get Platforms, and we don’t get Accessibility. The two are basically the same thing, because platforms solve accessibility. A platform is accessibility.</p></blockquote><p id="4bbb">I want to get to the point, t<strong>he next great social networking platform must be an open platform — it cannot be a walled garden and it cannot be centrally controlled like Facebook, twitter , reddit and the like rest!</strong></p><p id="314b">This is what brings me to my next point!</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*shcPXe7eBMSkacdlZwZMRg.jpeg" width="700" height="1055" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*shcPXe7eBMSkacdlZwZMRg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*shcPXe7eBMSkacdlZwZMRg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*shcPXe7eBMSkacdlZwZMRg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*shcPXe7eBMSkacdlZwZMRg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*shcPXe7eBMSkacdlZwZMRg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="2248"><a href="https://medium.com/u/13be457aed12?source=post_page-----7b08ce57bdff--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Kleppmann</a> and some other folks published a great article on local-first software last year — I think this same principal must also apply to data, ai and everything else too! The next great social networking platform must include notions of local-first software, data, ai, workflows, and algorithmic insights if we are serious about getting big brother and big tech out of our lives and taking control of our our social reality.</p><p id="56c6"><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html" rel="noopener">Please find that article here</a>. I think he does a far-better job discussing some of these aspects and I’ve quoted some of his leading thoughts from the article below:</p><blockquote><p id="195f">In the process of performing that creative work, you typically produce files and data: documents, presentations, spreadsheets, code, notes, drawings, and so on. And you will want to keep that data: for reference and inspiration in the future, to include it in a portfolio, or simply to archive because you feel proud of it. It is important to <em>feel ownership</em> of that data, because the creative expression is something so personal.</p><p id="edb7">Unfortunately, cloud apps are problematic in this regard. Although they let you access your data anywhere, all data access must go via the server, and you can only do the things that the server will let you do. In a sense, you don’t have full ownership of that data — the cloud provider does. In the words of a <a href="http://www.chriswatterston.com/blog/my-there-is-no-cloud-sticker" rel="noopener">bumper sticker</a>: “There is no cloud, it’s just someone else’s computer.”</p><p id="f738">We use the term <em>“ownership”</em> not in the sense of intellectual property law and copyright, but rather as the creator’s perceived relationship to their data. We discuss this notion in <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html#user-control" rel="noopener">a later section</a>.</p><p id="ba06">When data is stored on “someone else’s computer”, that third party assumes a degree of control over that data. Cloud apps are provided as a service; if the service is unavailable, you cannot use the software, and you can no longer access your data created with that software. If the service shuts down, even though you might be able to export your data, without the servers there is normally no way for you to continue running your own copy of that software. Thus, you are at the mercy of the company providing the service.</p><p id="df6a">Before web apps came along, we had what we might call “old-fashioned” apps: programs running on your local computer, reading and writing files on the local disk. We still use a lot of applications of this type today: text editors and IDEs, Git and other version control systems, and many specialized software packages such as graphics applications or CAD software fall in this category.</p><p id="72e7">The software we are talking about in this article are apps for creating documents or files (such as text, graphics, spreadsheets, CAD drawings, or music), or personal data repositories (such as notes, calendars, to-do lists, or password managers). We are not talking about implementing things like banking services, e-commerce, social networking, ride-sharing, or similar …</p></blockquote></div></div></section></div></div>

    <p>Application supports basic vector graphics primitives: rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses, pies, sectors,
        chords, polygons, Bézier curves, text and bitmaps.</p>

    <p>The objects may be structured on pages, layers and just in selectable groups/containers. Pages within a document
        can be of different sizes.</p>

    <p>Bézier curves are fundamental rendering units. All the primitives can be converted into curves. We use
        <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cairo library</a>
        to render these curves on the screen. </p>

    <p>Thanks to cairo we have cross-platform unified antialiased rendering, similar to PostScript/PDF definitions.</p>

    <p>Like PS/PDF definitions, sK1 2.0 provides solid fill, gradient fill and pattern fill for graphics primitives. Also
        the objects can be outlined by solid stroke</p>

    <p>Like for PDF objects, alphachannel is available for solid fill, gradient stops and for stroke color.
        Application supports RGB, CMYK and Grayscale colorspaces. SPOT colors are also supported.</p>
    <p><i>Note: PANTONE® colors are just a special case of SPOT colors.</i></p>

<![CDATA[“Product market fit” is a silly term for what it wants to describe]]>

You might have never heard of an "<a href="https://wor.do/idle_asset">idle asset</a>" before. But you probably have a good idea of what it means. Even your grandmas first guess of what an “idle asset” is, is likely to be correct.</p><p>

This cannot be said of <i>“product market fit”</i>.<br>
Ask 10 people, grandmas or even Y-Combinator applicants, and the answers will be all over the place.</p><p>

<b>Michael Seibel chips in</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xx912ku.jpg" width="100%">

<small><i>"You have reached product market fit when you are overwhelmed with usage—usually to the point where you can’t even make major changes to your product because you are swamped just keeping it up and running."</i>[1]</small></p><p>

Another YC partner said that demand is growing <i>soooo</i> fast, that you just want to die.</p><p>
<i>"If you don't want to die, you don't have product market fit"</i>.</p><p>

So the people who popularized the term, say it's synonymous to <i>extreme growth</i> or <i>incredible demand</i>. Then why not call it that? Anyone and their grandma will understand such terms right away.</p><p>


<b>"Dominance"</b></p><p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHRVkCj.png" width="100%"></p><p>
Google basically <i>owns</i> the search market. They absolutely <i>dominate</i> it. Perhaps, "product market fit" is just a euphemism to avoid using the term dominant. Hmm.</p><p>

<b>So what does product market fit really mean?</b><br>
It simply means that your product and its market have found each other, and by extension, that often means seeing serious growth. Though sometimes, the product is catered towards a niche audience, in which case it might not become the next Google, while still enjoying <i>product market fit</i>.</p><p>

<b>Naval's got something to say too</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9g9dJVk.png" width="100%"><br>

Is that really so Naval? 🧐<br>
By that definition, many of the sideprojects I built, that went absolutely nowhere, all had product market fit. Yay. </p><p>

In reality, many nice sounding quotes require the stretching of a definition in order to make sense.<br>Example: <i>"Real wealth is having lots of free time"</i>.</p><p>
It sounds great, right? But, can you transfer this "real wealth" to your cousin from Bangladesh who's working 14 hours a day? I like Naval, though, I think that one was a miss. But I digress..</p><p>

<b>OK, so now what?</b><br>
When possible, use simple words. YC is big on avoiding <a href="https://wor.do/buzzword">buzzwords</a>, yet they throw around <i>product market fit</i> left and right, leaving many people confused. Just say <i>extreme growth</i>, or any alternative that is understood quickly.




</p><!--
Here’s a few terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit<br>

* Extremely rapid growth<br>
* Painfully fast growth<br>
* Long lasting growth<br>
* Rapid Compound growth<br>
</li>

<br><br>
I could write a PHP random word generator, and come up with many more terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit does.

PSAC announced the results of the vote Wednesday.</p>  <p>"They perform vital work protecting Canada from foreign cyber and attacks, foreign hacking attempts,"&nbsp;Alex Silas, PSAC's regional executive vice-president for the National Capital Region, told&nbsp;CBC News.</p>  <p>"For example, things that we saw this past July, there was an attempt to hack Canadian COVID-19 research. These are the workers that stopped that."</p>    <p>CSE,&nbsp;one of Canada's key intelligence agencies, employs&nbsp;about&nbsp;2,900 people and&nbsp;is responsible for foreign intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>  <p>The vote comes nearly two years after talks&nbsp;stalled on a collective agreement. At issue is a change to the&nbsp;market allowance —&nbsp; a wage supplement negotiated to close pay gaps with workers doing similar work in the private sector. It's a benefit&nbsp;often used to attract employees into highly technical jobs in the public service.</p>  <p>"CSE management is refusing to apply a wage increase to the portion of workers' salaries that is&nbsp;made up of market allowances," said Silas.</p>  <p>"To give you an idea, for some of these workers [that] represents as much as 10 per cent of their annual income.&nbsp;So it's a significant financial loss."</p>  <p>The vote&nbsp;does not mean&nbsp;workers are&nbsp;heading for the picket lines.</p>  <p>"We are now ramping up preparations and coordinating with our members to determine the precise actions that will be taken and their timing. But we emphasize that strike action can still be avoided if CSE management comes back to the table and steps away from its concession or agrees to arbitration," said PSAC spokesperson&nbsp;Alroy Fonseca.</p>  <h2>CSE says services will continue</h2>  <p>Christopher Williams, director general of CSE public affairs and communications services, said CSE's executive management team continues to work toward&nbsp;a resolution with the union.</p>  <p>"However, we can tell you that essential service agreements are in place to ensure that all areas of&nbsp;CSE&nbsp;have the people at work necessary to continue to provide for the safety and security of the public in the event of a strike," he said in an email to CBC News.</p>  <p>CSE has been sounding the alarm about the threat of cyber&nbsp;attacks on research facilities and the health care sector during the pandemic. It was one of the intelligence agencies that stated a hacker group backed by Russia&nbsp;"almost certainly" tried&nbsp;to steal COVID-19-related vaccine research in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.</p>  <p>Late last year, CSE warned that state-sponsored actors are "very likely" trying to shore up their cyber capabilities to attack Canada's&nbsp;critical infrastructure — such as the electricity&nbsp;supply&nbsp;— to intimidate or to prepare for future online assaults.</p>  <p>While the lights will remain on, the union says the agency will lose workers if it doesn't offer&nbsp;competitive salaries.</p>  <p>"What does it say about how we prioritize national security?" said Silas.&nbsp;"If CSE as an employer, as management, doesn't recognize the need to pay these workers a fair market rate, how are we going to attract and retain the talent needed for the important work of keeping Canadians safe from cyber attacks?"</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

February 24, 2021 | https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
							<p>Running Tide Technologies, a Portland-based company that operates traditional oyster farms, has just emerged from stealth with a big, bold plan to sequester gigatons of CO2 on the ocean floor over the next several years by growing kelp and then sinking it to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The company has been keeping its cards close to the vest, but Fast Company magazine <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90548820/forget-planting-trees-this-company-is-making-carbon-offsets-by-putting-seaweed-on-the-ocean-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article</a> today revealing Running Tide’s plan to leverage its aquaculture expertise to tackle the issue of climate change. Its plan, according to the magazine, is to grow kelp, which like other plants extracts carbon dioxide from the environment, on floating rigs and then sink them to the ocean floor. Once there, the CO2 could remain sequestered for centuries.</p>
<p>“Once it goes down below 1,000 meters, it’s not coming back up, because the pressures are so great,” Marty Odlin, Running Tide’s founder and CEO, told Fast Company. “So you can get at least 1,000 years of sequestration. More likely, it will turn into oil or sediment and be sequestered on the geologic timescale—millions of years.”</p>
<p>Unlike terrestrial forests that can burn or degrade and release the carbon back into the atmosphere, marine plants don’t break down as easy. Plus, coastal&nbsp;ecosystems sequester up to 20 times more carbon per acre than land forests, <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/how-kelp-naturally-combats-global-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to this article</a> published by Harvard University.</p>
<p>Running Tide <a href="https://www.runningtide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated its website</a> this week. While previously focused on traditional shellfish aquaculture, it now includes language about its “negative emissions journey” to combat climate change with its kelp. It also says that Running Tide will be selling “kelp carbon credits.”</p>
<p>Maine Startups Insider had heard rumors about the company and how it had been able to attract big-time VC money. MSI <a href="https://mainestartupsinsider.com/has-silicon-valley-big-shot-chris-sacca-invested-in-a-maine-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article last week</a> speculating that Chris Sacca, one of Silicon Valley’s most well-known venture capitalists, had invested in the company via his new VC firm, Lowercarbon Capital. Sacca did not respond to MSI’s requests for confirmation, but did announce his firm’s investment in the Portland company on Twitter after the Fast Company article was published.</p>
<p>“Bonkers scale, unreasonable ambition, massive impact on the plant. During insane times, it’s entrepreneurs like @martyodlin that fire us up,” Sacca tweeted.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Shopify, the ecommerce behemoth, also revealed itself this week as an investor in Running Tide. The ecommerce-platform company last year launched its Sustainability Fund to fight climate change. On Monday, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment/sustainability-fund/ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it shared in a blog post</a> how it invested its first $5 million, including an investment of undisclosed size in Running Tide.</p>
<p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster,” Odlin told Shopify. “Everyone should try to slow it down, but we should pick 15–20 technologies that might be able to stop the whole thing all by themselves. That’s what we’re trying to build.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I have not been successful getting the company to confirm how much it raised, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/266342-50#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but Pitchbook claims</a> it raised $11.2 million in November 2019. In addition to Lowercarbon Capital and Shopify,&nbsp;PitchBook lists three additional investors: Soraya Darabi, an angel investor, San Francisco-based Pathbreaker Ventures, and San Francisco-based Yes VC.</p>
<p>David Frankel, a partner at Boston-based Founder Collective, also revealed on Twitter on Tuesday that he had led the seed financing.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/proudfirstinvestor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#proudfirstinvestor</a> </p>

<p><i>February 24, 2021</i></p>


<p>
This post will explore the distinction between <i>values</i> and <i>metavalues</i> (representations) as the
objects of computation, particularly in a mathematical software context.
A clear separation between values and metavalues
is an idea that
appears in symbolic computation systems,
compilers, code analysis tools,
and interval arithmetic software (among other settings),
but it has arguably
never been pursued to its full potential,
especially at the level of programming language design.
</p>

<p>
The case can be made that many bugs and footguns
in computer algebra systems and programming languages
are the result of a confused treatment of values and metavalues (see Figure 1),
and the title of this post could just as well have been "Why is my mathematical software full of bugs?".
A satisfactory answer to that question would require considering other
aspects; for example,
<a href="https://fredrikj.net/blog/2021/01/infinity-in-calcium-and-fungrim/">infinities
and singularities</a> are a largely orthogonal issue (though there are
points of overlap with the value-metavalue problem),
and then of course there are all the usual categories of
bugs that are not specific to mathematical software. Nevertheless,
I believe that metavalue mismanagement is particularly fundamental.</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ligozzi_(Una_quimera).jpg"><img src="https://fredrikj.net/blog/2021/02/computing-with-metavalues/chimera.jpg"></a><br>Figure 1: <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ligozzi_(Una_quimera).jpg">A chimera</a></i>, Jacopo Ligozzi (1547-1627).</p>

<p>
This topic is closely related to the problem
of defining equality/equivalence/isomorphism
(see for example <i><a href="http://people.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf">When is one thing equal to some other thing?</a></i>
by Barry Mazur) and other problems in metamathematics, though my concern in this post will be more with
concrete software implementation issues than with foundations of mathematics.
Complex isomorphisms are a challenge when formalizing modern abstract mathematics,
but misuse of metavalues leads to
incorrect present-day implementations of mathematical objects that had correct foundations 2000 years ago.
</p>



<h2 id="section1">Values and metavalues</h2>

<p>
I will use <i>value</i> to refer to any mathematically definable object
and <i>metavalue</i> to refer to a description of a value used for computations.
An isomorphic representation of a value qualifies a metavalue,
but a metavalue need not unambiguously identify a specific value;
it suffices for a metavalue to describe a property of a value
(possibly shared by several possible values),
or to provide an approximate or heuristic description.
It may also carry extra information (metadata) that has nothing
to do with the value itself.
</p>

<p>
This notion of <i>metavalue</i> is informal, and the terminology is
not necessarily standard, with apologies to any professional logicians who happen to read this.
I want to avoid using a term that either sounds too general or has a preexisting technical meaning
(model, abstraction, representation, approximation, image, etc.).
In software, metavalues may appear explicitly (as distinct entities from values), implicitly (in the semantics of operations),
or informally (in usage patterns).
The distinction is mainly one of <i>intent</i>: a metavalue is meant
to be used as a substitute for a (true) value.
</p>

<p>
Values are the objects we would ideally like to
represent and manipulate in software.
Here are some examples of interesting values, all of which
can defined formally within standard foundations of mathematics
(I will ignore issues such as the meaning of definability and whether foundations are consistent):</p>

<ul>
<li>The tuple $(1, 2, 3)$.</li>
<li>The boolean $\operatorname{True}$.</li>
<li>The real number $2 \pi$.</li>
<li>The set $\mathbb{Q}$.</li>
<li>The sequence $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \ldots)$.</li>
<li>The function $\exp : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$.</li>
<li>The category $\operatorname{Top}$ of topological spaces.</li>
<li>The integer $\operatorname{TREE}(3)$.</li>
<li>The truth value of the proposition "white has a winning sequence of moves from the starting position in chess".</li>
<li>The set of nonreal zeros of $\zeta(s)$ with real part not equal to $1/2$.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why do we need metavalues? Simple values such as the tuple $(1, 2, 3)$
correspond quite well to the values of native types in programming languages.
More formally, it is easy to encode such simple values on a Turing machine in a way
that permits carrying out natural operations (addition of integers, concatenation of tuples, testing equality, etc.) algorithmically.
However, the vast majority of specific mathematical objects are
impractical or impossible to represent as such.
Indeed, most individual real numbers, sets, etc. cannot be represented in any conceivable form on an actual computer since they would require an infinite amount of data:
a number like $2 \pi$ or a set like $\mathbb{Q}$ is an exception which happens to admit a simple symbolic description using standard formalisms.
Even if we acknowledge that objects we cannot even describe are beyond scope for any form of computation,
there are plenty of difficulties left when working with finitely definable objects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Most objects with finite descriptions are too large to represent explicitly on a physical computer (for example, $\operatorname{TREE}(3)$ is a tad too large to store in a <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> <tt>mpz_t</tt>).</li>
<li>Values that are clearly representable need not be computable in an explicit, meaningful way. For example, if a predicate is undecidable, we cannot explicitly reduce it to True or False (although either is perfectly representable). If it is undecidable whether a given real number $x$ represents zero, we cannot evaluate $\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ to an explicit number $-1, 0, +1$.</li>
<li>Even explicitly representable and computable values may be too costly or inconvenient to actually implement.</li>
<li>In some cases, we deliberately want to avoid representing specific values,
in order to model a range of possible outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For these reasons, it is often convenient (and sometimes necessary)
to work with metavalues—indirect, partial or approximate descriptions of values—instead of (perfectly faithful representations of) the values themselves.</p>

<p>
<i>Computing with metavalues</i>, in a narrow sense,
means taking a (mathematically specified) program and
running it with metavalues instead of values, either by explicitly executing
the steps of the program with metavalues instead of values or by performing
an abstract or symbolic analysis to deduce a metavalue for the return value of
the program (for simplicity, I will only consider pure functional programs).
More generally, it is often useful to move between
levels of abstraction and treat metavalues
themselves as values; unfortunately, this comes with the risk of
conflating value and metavalue semantics (an extremely common error in actual software).
</p>

<p>
Using metavalues, we can simulate
programs running on abstract mathematical machines manipulating perfect mathematical objects.
Indeed, computing with metavalues
even allows us to simulate nonstandard models of computation
which cannot be realized on ideal Turing machines,
let alone on physical computers with limited resources.
For example, floating-point arithmetic can be viewed as
a method of using approximate metavalues
to simulate (imperfectly!) the operation of Blum-Shub-Smale machines (abstract machines capable
of storing exact real numbers in registers).
</p>

<h3 id="section2">Examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of abstractions, computational paradigms and specific
techniques that may be considered use of metavalues:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Abstract interpretation</b> is a special
case of computing with metavalues.
In the terminology of abstract interpretation,
values are called <i>concrete values</i> and metavalues are called <i>abstract values</i>.
(This terminology assumes that concrete values are actually representable
and computable, whereas the view I'm taking here is that values are mathematical
abstractions while metavalues are concretely representable,
so the use of concrete/abstract is in some sense reversed.)
</li>

<li><b>Type inference</b>: the type of a value (or a typeclass of a value) is an example of a metavalue, and type inference is essentially abstract interpretation using types as the metavalues (abstract values).</li>

<li><b>Floating-point arithmetic</b> as a model of real arithmetic, with floating-point numbers
as metavalues approximating ideal real numbers.
More generally, any form of truncation or approximation can be seen as metavalue computation; this includes
truncated power series as an approximation of infinite
power series, Chebyshev series as a model of functions on $\mathbb{R}$ (see <a href="https://www.chebfun.org/">Chebfun</a>),
matrices as an approximation of infinite-dimensional linear operators, and so on.
</li>

<li>
<b>Word-size integers</b> as an approximate model of integers (or more generally, residue class rings as an approximation of various rings).
</li>

<li><b>Interval arithmetic</b> (as well as <b>ball arithmetic</b>) is a nonexact but rigorous model of real arithmetic, where real numbers
are represented by enclosing sets.
More generally, interval arithmetic can be generalized to computing enclosures for arbitrary sets of values
(this is closely related to abstract interpretation and type inference).</li>

<li><b>Symbolic computation</b> with free variables. A symbolic expression such as $3x+4y$ can be viewed as a metavalue representing the possible values
resulting from substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$, and if $x$ and $y$ are specified with constraints (for example, $0 \le x, y \le 1$), this can
be viewed as a kind of enclosure, which additionally allows tracking dependencies between the free variables.</li>

<li><b>Significance arithmetic</b> is an extension of floating-point arithmetic where each approximation carries an estimate of the error.</li>

<li><b>Fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, fuzzy intervals</b> are generalizations of interval arithmetic that allow assigning varying probabilities
to different elements of the enclosing sets.</li>

<li><b>Conjectural results, and outright guessing</b>. Results computed using Monte Carlo algorithms or assuming unproved conjectures (such as the Riemann hypothesis)
can be considered metavalues; even when the output value is represented exactly, it implicitly carries with it some degree of uncertainty.</li>

<li><b>Results carrying proof certificates or software information</b>. More on this later.</li>

<li><b>Error values and exceptions</b> can in some cases be viewed as metavalues representing loss of information.</li>

</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is not especially newsy, but ever since I first heard of the idea a year ago I’ve been obsessed with universal Fed Accounts.</p><p>On the Federal Reserve’s website they have an FAQ which, among other things, debunks some kind of fraud which is based on saying that everyone can get a bank account with the Fed based on their Social Security number:</p><blockquote><p>A recent hoax circulating on the internet asserts that the Federal Reserve maintains accounts for individuals that are tied to the individual's Social Security number, and that individuals can access these accounts to pay bills and obtain money. These claims are&nbsp;false. The Federal Reserve does not maintain accounts for individuals, and individuals should not attempt to make payments using Federal Reserve Bank routing numbers or false routing numbers. Individuals who attempt to pay bills or conduct other transactions using a Federal Reserve Bank routing number may face penalty fees from the company they were attempting to pay, or the suspension or closure of their commercial bank or payment service provider accounts. Law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is aware of this scheme, and individuals who participate in such schemes could also face criminal charges.</p></blockquote><p>So to be clear: It is not true that the Fed maintains basic checking accounts for all Americans that can be used to pay bills and obtain money, with the accounts numbered after your unique Social Security number. </p><p>But shouldn’t it be true? </p><p>Once upon a time, governments didn’t issue paper currency, and instead banknotes were printed privately by banks. But over time, we came to see this as a worthwhile public service. Paper money still exists, obviously, but for most people most of the time electronic transactions are the predominant form of currency. When we say “stimulus checks” we are mostly talking about direct deposits, not literal checks, and we are definitely not talking about envelopes full of $100 bills. </p><p>The Fed should provide everyone with access to electronic currency on an equitable basis by giving everyone a bank account. You can read a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/06/22/a-public-option-for-bank-accounts-or-central-banking-for-all/">detailed treatment of the issue from Morgan Ricks, John Crawford, and Lev Menand</a> if you’d like, but honestly the basic idea is exactly the myth the Fed debunked. Everyone would have an account; everyone would be able to deposit checks or accept direct deposits into the account; everyone would be able to pay bills through the account; and you could use the Post Office to provide the retail branches of the system. </p><p>Commercial banks will obviously hate this idea.</p><p>But to be fair to them, I think the Fed accounts should pay no interest and offer no services beyond basic deposits, payments, and ATM withdrawals. The idea is to solve the social problem of the unbanked, not to get into the full panoply of financial services — because the benefits of universal banking are considerable, even if the accounts themselves don’t have any bells and whistles.</p><h4>Helping the unbanked</h4><p>In a direct sense, the big benefit here is that a universal banking initiative would help out the “unbanked” — <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2019execsum.pdf">people who don’t have bank accounts</a> — typically because they don’t have enough money to meet the minimum balance thresholds. This is only about 5% of households in the most recent data (which was from before the pandemic), but as you can see in the FDIC’s chart, this looks to be a somewhat cyclical phenomenon where people lose their bank accounts when the economy is bad.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd736b7dc-9895-47ea-bbe7-42962748d6d1_1370x896.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd736b7dc-9895-47ea-bbe7-42962748d6d1_1370x896.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d736b7dc-9895-47ea-bbe7-42962748d6d1_1370x896.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:896,&quot;width&quot;:1370,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:237997,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Life as one of the unbanked is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/costs-of-being-unbanked-or-underbanked/#:~:text=Using%20the%20FDIC's%20estimate%20that,in%20annual%20costs%20per%20person.">full of annoying fees</a> to check-cashing joints or providers of prepaid debit cards. </p><p>A public bank would do away with all that, which is good. </p><p>But the issue of the unbanked is, in some ways, bigger than it looks. </p><p>Oftentimes you might look at a scummy banking practice charging people huge overdraft fees instead of simply not processing excess payments and think to yourself “why doesn’t Congress just ban that?”</p><p>Well, bank lobbyists are part of the answer. But what the lobbyists will tell you is that administering checking accounts is not very lucrative. That’s why the minimum account balances that push people out of banking exist in the first place. The harder you make it to rip people off, the higher the minimum balance needs to be to make the business make sense. If that sounds shitty to you, well — it’s shitty! And public bank accounts are the solution. But the even broader benefit is that solving the problem of the unbanked will supersede the need to find other solutions for the problems of the unbanked.</p><h4>Toward a cashless tomorrow</h4><p>Back 10 years ago when cities were first setting up bikeshare systems, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-12-26/bike-sharing-for-the-unbanked">how to make them accessible to the unbanked</a> became a constant source of tension, because actually fixing the underlying problem of people not having bank accounts wasn’t on the table.</p><p>This comes up basically any time a progressive jurisdiction wants to roll out something new that involves paying fees — you can’t just ignore the unbanked minority, so you need a complicated workaround. </p><p>And it’s now spreading to the private sector. Philadelphia was the first city to <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/cashless-ban-philadelphia-stores-sweetgreen-bluestone-lane-20191004.html">ban cashless stores</a> back in 2019, and <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/technology/cashless-ban-highlights-new-yorks-unbanked-problem.html">New York City did it last year</a>. D.C.’s cashless ban is so new I didn’t even <a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/12/02/cashless-businesses-ban-dc-council/">realize it had passed</a>, but after a unanimous D.C. Council vote in December, it will be taking effect soon.  </p><p>The cost of these kinds of bans can be sneakily high precisely because cashless retail is so rare. You’re not taking away anything that most businesses are actually familiar with, so opposition is muted and the consequences are hidden. But cashlessness seems like a promising idea for a world where the vast majority of the customer base can pay electronically over your smartphone. Most immediately, you don’t need to worry about theft or handling of cash. The checkout line moves faster. </p><p>Down the road, though, cashlessness lets you try to reimagine the entire flow of the business to raise productivity. Maybe your coffee place or fast-casual lunch spot doesn’t need cashiers at all — ordering is just done on your phone and then you pick it up. Most companies probably aren’t interested in rethinking their whole operation along those lines right now. But if we do the right thing on fiscal and monetary policy, get full employment and see wages start rising, then increasing your productivity with a combination of new technology and new business processes will be huge. But not if we make it standard to legally require the use of legacy payment methods.</p><p>On the other hand, I sincerely sympathize with what these cities are trying to accomplish. If I were on the D.C. Council, I might’ve voted for the cashless ban. My point is just that requiring cash is not a real solution to this problem — what we need to do is give everyone bank accounts. It’s a fairness issue, but it’s also an infrastructure and innovation issue. Creating a uniform, reliable, national currency was a huge step forward in its day. But people want cards and electronic transactions. Making the private sector the sole provider of those services is holding the whole country back, even though most people have them. </p><p>Meanwhile, Fed accounts could be the basis for further public sector innovation.</p><h4>“Checks” for everyone</h4><p>One of the great policy innovations of the Trump years was the idea of the government sending out flat stimulus checks that, though not truly universal, did go to the vast majority of the population, phasing out only for the affluent. </p><p>These checks had two big upsides. One is that they seemed genuinely very popular, curing the problem that bedeviled us in the 2009-13 period when it seemed hard to get a political consensus on how to stimulate. The other is that they hit the pockets of greatest need — nobody was excluded on the basis of spotty work history or anything like that. </p><p>The problem with this sort of loosely targeted approach is you get very little bang for your buck. Plenty of money went to people who were just employed continuously throughout the pandemic and who, while surely glad to have some extra money, were not in any particular distress. Aggregate statistics show that caught between extra cash from the Treasury and health warnings from the CDC, these people mostly just built up a savings cushion or paid down old credit card debt. There’s nothing wrong with that, but to the extent that your concern is only with stimulating the economy, it’s better to spend the money in more targeted ways. But targeted spending inevitably becomes politically controversial because it creates some winners and some losers. It’s much more tractable to give the money to everyone, even if that involves more spending than is strictly necessary. </p><p>As far as I’m concerned, the solution is obvious — do completely untargeted checks, and just make them really big. In effect, you’d be taking debt off of private balance sheets and putting it on the public sector, which has an easier time bearing it. </p><p>But just accumulating public sector debt willy-nilly frightens a lot of people. Even when interest rates are super-duper-low, you can always worry that they might rise in the future, creating rollover risk. </p><p>I think reasonable people can disagree as to how much sense it makes to worry about that versus how much debt stock is a purely political problem. But Fed Accounts solve the problem. If Congress wants to make $2,000 materialize in everyone’s account, they can just pass a law that makes that happen. The money doesn’t have to “come from” anywhere or add to the debt stock. And rather than doing it through one-off appropriations, Congress could <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/voxs-the-weeds/episode/fix-recessions-by-giving-people-money-66991306">follow Claudia Sahm’s suggestion and make disbursements automatic</a> based on labor market conditions. Alternatively, if Congress doesn’t feel like taking responsibility for making policy choices, they could give the Fed’s Open Market Committee (the people who make monetary policy decisions) the authority to make drops into everyone’s Fed account as a stabilization tool. </p><p>Now to be clear, just because you can print unlimited sums of money …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <div><p>In the software industry, changing a running system is dangerous. As the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Unfortunately, even if code were perfect, progress marches ever forward, and new features are continually being added. One of the worst feelings for a developer is learning that something you just shipped has caused an issue, or even worse, an incident.</p><p>For companies like Shopify that practice continuous deployment, our code is changing multiple times every day. We have to de-risk new features to ship safely and confidently without impacting the million+ merchants using our platform.</p><p>Beta flags are one approach to feature development that gives us a number of notable advantages, among them:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Reduce blast radius of changes–if they happen not to go as planned–by rolling out the beta to a percentage of the subject group.</li>
<li>Instantaneously choose when the change is active in production. Without beta flags, changes would be active at the time of deployment.</li>
<li>Instantaneously rollback the feature.</li>
<li>Ship new code paths, typically inactive, but allow devs to test these code paths in production.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Anatomy of a Beta Flag</h2>
<div><p>The word “beta” is a bit overloaded in the software industry, being used even to refer to launched products. We’ll define some primitives for clarity.</p><p><strong>Subject</strong>: A concept that you want to define a control plane against. For multi-tenant SAAS applications, this is typically the model corresponding to your tenant. For Shopify, this is typically our concept of a shop. While designing, consider a polymorphic approach so you can implement betas against multiple types of things.</p><p><strong>BetaIdentifier</strong>: This is often a simple string that represents the feature you are developing. For example, “multi_location.” Keep in mind that if you use a string instead of an auto-incrementing integer, you should be wary of case-sensitivity and of accidentally re-using this same string in the future. Metadata can be associated with this and should be considered for internal documentation/tooling purposes. For example, a high-level description of the feature, a list of chat channels requiring notification about this feature’s rollout, a list of owners, descriptions of the behavior when this feature is enabled or disabled, etc.</p><p><strong>BetaFlag</strong>: At the lowest level, this is a small piece of data associated with a Subject. This can be implemented as a “Subject <code>has_many</code> BetaFlag” relationship. Inside the BetaFlag, we have a BetaIdentifier and typically some <code>created_at/updated_at</code> timestamps.</p><p>For a given BetaFlag, we can:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Check if an instance of Subject has this BetaIdentifier? If so, the feature is turned on for the Subject.</li>
<li>Grab a list of all Subjects with this BetaIdentifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>This check allows us explicit per-Subject feature toggling.</p>
<p><strong>BetaRollout</strong>: This is data that lives unrelated to any one particular Subject. Inside BetaRollout, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>beta_name</strong>: a BetaIdentifier, so we can know which concept we’re dealing with.</li>
<li>
<strong>percentage_rollout</strong>: an integer (0..100) reflecting which percentage of Subject you wish to enable the BetaFlag for.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;method to calculate whether to consider a Subject as “rolled out”.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>For a given BetaRollout, we can ask, “Does an instance of Subject have this BetaIdentifier?” If so, the feature is turned on for the Subject.</p><p>If the BetaRollout record does not exist, we will assume that the feature is turned off.</p><p>Here’s an example of a performant way to implement the <code>BetaRollout#enabled?</code> method:</p></div>
<div>
<p>
By calculating a digest of the two identifiers and converting it into an integer modulo 100, we ensure that each percentage rollout will hit a different set of Subjects as the % increases. This means that a different subset of Subjects is affected every time for every beta rollout we do. Why does this matter? This prevents potential negative effects that occur due to rollouts from affecting the same subset of subjects consistently.</p><p>This implementation also has a nice invariant: As the percentage increases (For example, from 0% to 11%, then 11% to 20%, etc.), the previous set of Subjects that saw the feature is still seeing the feature. The digest modulo 100 remains static even as the rollout_percentage changes. This is key to ensuring a nice user experience because it would be frustrating to experience a feature appearing and disappearing (seemingly randomly) as the rollout percentage increases.</p><p>The ultimate effect is that every BetaRollout has a uniquely consistent growing set of Subjects experiencing the feature in the journey from 0% to 100% (or from <em>X</em>% to 0%).</p></div>
<h2>Bundling These Concepts</h2>
<p>Once we define a BetaIdentifier, we can do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the new feature to a particular Subject by creating and associating a new record of BetaFlag to the Subject.</li>
<li>Roll out the feature to <em>X</em>% of Subjects by creating a BetaRollout and setting it to a particular % value.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two separate concepts are related to the BetaIdentifier. The question about whether or not a new feature is enabled then looks something like this for a given Subject:</p>

<div><p>In English, this equates to “Does the subject have the flag explicitly (via BetaFlag) or implicitly (via BetaRollout)?” It’s helpful to define this in some fashion, so we’ll call this unified view the <strong>Beta</strong>.</p><p>What happens when we want to revert the beta flag? Perhaps the feature is bugged. There are two cases to consider:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The flag was rolled out using the % mechanism only.</li>
<li>The flag was rolled out by manually applying the flag to specific instances of the Subject.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>When the flag is rolled out using the % mechanism only, the rollback process is extremely straightforward: change the % rollout value of the BetaRollout to `0`. Note that anyone with the explicit application of the flag will still see the feature.</p><p>When the flag is rolled out to potentially thousands of Subjects by direct application, we find ourselves in a more challenging situation. We have an ongoing incident and thousands of records in the DB that we can’t quickly remove. In the best case, we have to write a maintenance task to alter the database for these thousands of Subjects. In the absolute worst case, it’s just not possible!</p><p>It would’ve been tempting to refer to the Beta concept directly throughout our code because it seems to give us all the flexibility we want. However, we’ve just discovered a case where we can’t easily rollback. How do we proceed?</p></div>
<h2>Taking Things a Step Further</h2>
<p>Instead of having all of our code refer to a Beta directly, we should be writing an abstraction a layer higher. In our hypothetical situation, we can imagine something called a “Feature” that is defined like:</p>

<p>With another layer above the primitives like this, we’ve just introduced flexibility for developers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply a feature directly to a specific Subject (or thousands of them).<br>For example: Adding a feature to a production Subject for testing or for a particularly unique rollout that cannot be %-based.</li>
<li>Apply this feature to a random %-based sampling of all other Subjects.<br>For example: A typical rollout of a feature might encompass slowly rolling out to an ever-increasing population of Subjects</li>
<li>Apply an escape hatch for specific Subjects that encounter problems with the feature by applying the my-cool-new-feature-opt-out flag directly to the Subject.<br>For example: Some bugs encountered might not be severe enough to roll back the rollout for all Subjects, but we want to allow a specific Subject to disable the feature</li>
<li>Apply a kill switch for all Subjects by rolling out the my-cool-new-feature-opt-out flag to 100%.<br>For example: A Beta has been applied to thousands of Subject but can’t easily be removed, but we need to halt the feature immediately</li>
</ul>
<div><p>If we imagine a runaway train of an incident caused by rolling out your feature, we see that we should hopefully be able to instantly resolve it by applying the kill switch! Power, safety, speed.</p><p>Often, beta features might start with some simple qualifications. Invariably, they often evolve to become something more like:</p></div>

<p>Using a higher-level abstraction makes room for the feature to easily change qualification as the business demands change. In our experience, even things that seem like simple Yes|No Beta flags often evolve to have other requirements. This is all to say that you should consider avoiding referring to the lower level primitives directly. It’s easier to change one method than dozens of interspersed <code>Beta.enabled?(...)</code> invocations. This generalizes nicely to exposure over an API: If the feature evolves, but <em>N</em> clients are still referring directly to the primitives, we can’t necessarily update all of them simultaneously without the higher-level abstraction being exposed.</p>
<h2>Some Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>This is just one path to developing new features safely and efficiently that we’ve found to be highly effective at Shopify. The formulations we developed here are informative, and your implementation will surely differ.</p>
<h3>Data Structure Differences and Reconciliation</h3>
<div><p>If code path A generates data incompatible with code path B, you will likely have problems when you roll back unless you have preemptively considered the rollback experience upfront. Always consider what happens when you switch paths.</p><p>This beta pattern optimizes the ability to change code paths in production quickly, but the lingering data can often be forgotten.</p></div>
<h3>Not all Features Can be Developed Sanely in this Manner</h3>
<p>Similar to the previous point, some features have impacts on your underlying data model. Even if we considered migrating between the two code paths, you might encounter a feature where rolling back leaves things in a worse or nonsensical state. Some things simply don’t make sense to have the ability to be rolled back. Some features are better developed iteratively rather than switched on all at once.</p>
<h3>Not all Features Can be Rolled Back Without a User Disruption</h3>
<div><p>Imagining a new feature: once a user has come to depend on it, it may be impossible to roll back without leaving the user confused. Imagine introducing a new business concept that wasn’t fully …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Cryptographers and cryptography engineers love to talk about the latest attacks and how to mitigate them. <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/26/learning-from-ladderleak-is-ecdsa-broken/">LadderLeak</a> breaks ECDSA with less than 1 bit of nonce leakage? <a href="https://raccoon-attack.com/">Raccoon attack</a> brings the Hidden Number attack to finite field Diffie-Hellman in TLS?</p>



<p>And while this sort of research is important and <em>fun</em>, most software developers have much bigger problems to contend with, when it comes to the cryptographic security of their products and services.</p>



<p>So let’s start by talking about Java cryptography.</p>







<h2 id="java">Cryptography in Java</h2>



<p>In Java, the way you’re supposed to encrypt data using symmetric cryptography is with the <code>javax.crypto.Cipher</code> class. So to encrypt with AES-GCM, you’d call <code>Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")</code> and use the resulting object to process your data. <code>javax.crypto.Cipher</code> can be used for a lot of ill-advised modes (including ECB mode) and ciphers (including DES).</p>



<p>Can you guess what class you’d use to encrypt data with RSA in Java?</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nSQs0Gr9FA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>The square hole is javax.crypto.Cipher.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s right! RSA goes in the <code>Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding")</code> hole.</p>



<p>(Or, more likely, <code>Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding")</code>, which is <em><a href="https://robotattack.org/">not great</a></em>.)</p>







<p>Also, as a reminder: <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/01/20/please-stop-encrypting-with-rsa-directly/">You don’t want to encrypt data with RSA directly</a>. You want to encrypt <em>symmetric keys</em> with RSA, and then encrypt your actual data with those symmetric keys. Preferably using <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2021/01/22/hybrid-encryption-and-the-kem-dem-paradigm/">a KEM+DEM paradigm</a>.</p>



<p>Fun anecdote: The naming of <code>RSA/ECB/$padding</code> is misleading because it doesn’t actually implement a sort of ECB mode. However, a few projects over the years missed that memo and decided to implement RSA-ECB so they could be “compatible” with what they thought Java did. That is: They broke long messages into equal sized chunks (237 bytes for 2048-bit RSA), encrypted them independently, and then concatenated the ciphertexts together.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t end there. <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a> explodes brilliantly if you ever reuse a nonce. Naturally, the <code>Cipher</code> class <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html">shifts all of this burden onto the unwitting developer that calls it</a>, which results in a regurgitated mess that looks like this (from the Java documentation):</p>


<pre title=""> GCMParameterSpec s = ...;
 cipher.init(..., s);

 // If the GCM parameters were generated by the provider, it can
 // be retrieved by:
 // cipher.getParameters().getParameterSpec(GCMParameterSpec.class);

 cipher.updateAAD(...);  // AAD
 cipher.update(...);     // Multi-part update
 cipher.doFinal(...);    // conclusion of operation

 // Use a different IV value for every encryption
 byte[] newIv = ...;
 s = new GCMParameterSpec(s.getTLen(), newIv);
 cipher.init(..., s);
 ...
</pre>


<p>If you fail to perform this kata perfectly, you’ll introduce a nonce reuse vulnerability into your application.</p>



<p>And if you look a little deeper, you’ll <em>also</em> learn that <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a50725db2ab621e1a17cb5505f78e4bc73972a27/src/java.base/share/classes/com/sun/crypto/provider/AESCrypt.java">their software implementation of AES</a> (which is used in any platform without hardware AES available–such as Android on older hardware) isn’t <a href="https://www.bearssl.org/constanttime.html#bitslicing">hardened against cache-timing attacks</a>… although <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a50725db2ab621e1a17cb5505f78e4bc73972a27/src/java.base/share/classes/com/sun/crypto/provider/GHASH.java#L69-L126">their GHASH implementation <em>is</em></a> (which implies cache-timing attacks are within their threat model). But that’s an implementation problem, not a design problem.</p>



<p>Kludgey, hard-to-use, easy-to-misuse. It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

<h2 id="php-does-it-better">Learning From PHP</h2>



<p>In 2015, when PHP 7 was being discussed on their mailing list, someone had the brilliant idea of creating a simple, cross-platform, extension-independent interface for getting random bytes and integers.</p>



<p>This effort would become <code>random_bytes()</code> and <code>random_int()</code> in PHP 7. (If you want to see how messy things were before PHP 7, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat/blob/master/lib/random.php">the appropriate polyfill library</a>.)</p>



<p>However, the initial design for this feature sucked really badly. Imagine the following code snippet:</p>


<pre title="">function makePassword(int $length = 20): string
{
    $password = '';
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $length; ++$i) {
        $password .= chr(random_int(33, 124));
    }
    return $password;
}
</pre>


<p>If your operating system’s random number generator failed (e.g. you’re in a chroot and cannot access <code>/dev/urandom</code>), then the <code>random_int()</code> call would have returned <code>false</code>.</p>



<p>Because of type shenanigans in earlier versions of PHP, <code>chr(false)</code> returns a NUL byte. (This is <a href="https://3v4l.org/k3Sb3">fixed since 7.4</a> when strict_types is enabled, but the latest version at the time was PHP 5.6.)</p>



<p>After a heated debate on both the Github issue tracker for PHP and the internal mailing lists, the PHP project <a href="https://www.sammyk.me/security-changes-to-the-php-7-csprng-in-rc3">did the right thing</a>: It will throw an Exception if it cannot safely generate random data.</p>



<p>Exceptions are developer-friendly: If you do not catch the exception, it kills the script immediately. If you decide to catch them, you can handle them in whatever graceful way you prefer. (Pretty error pages are often better than a white page and HTTP 500 status code, after all.)</p>







<p>In version 7.2 of the PHP programming language, they also made another win: <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">Libsodium</a> was promoted as part of <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/libsodium">the PHP standard library</a>.</p>



<p>However, this feature isn’t as good as it could be: It’s easy to mix up inputs to the libsodium API since it expects <code>string</code> arguments instead of dedicated types (<code>X25519SecretKey</code> vs <code>X25519PublicKey</code>). To address this, the open source community has provided <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">PHP libraries that avoid this mistake</a>.</p>



<p>(I bet you weren’t expecting to hear that PHP is doing better with cryptography than Java in 2021, but here we are!)</p>







<h2>Towards Usable Cryptography Interfaces</h2>



<p>How can we do better? At a minimum, we need to internalize Avi Douglen’s rule of usable security.</p>



<blockquote><p>Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security.</p><cite><a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/6116">AviD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I’d like to propose a set of tenets that cryptography libraries can use to self-evaluate the usability of their own designs and implementations. Keep in mind that these are tenets, not a checklist, so the spirit of the law means more than the literal narrowly-scoped interpretation.</p>



<h3>1. Follow the Principle of Least Astonishment</h3>



<p>Cryptography code should be boring, <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrincipleOfLeastAstonishment">never astonishing</a>. </p>



<p>For example: If you’re comparing cryptographic outputs, it should always be done in constant-time–even if timing leaks do not help attackers (i.e. in password hashing validation).</p>



<h3>2. Provide High-Level Abstractions</h3>



<p>For example: <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes">Sealed boxes</a>.</p>



<p>Most developers don’t need to fiddle with RSA and AES to construct their own hybrid public-key encryption designs (as you’d need to with Java). What they really need is a simple way to say, “Encrypt this so that only the recipient can decrypt it, but not the sender.”</p>



<p>This requires talking to your users and figuring out what their needs are instead of just assuming you know best.</p>



<h3>3. Logically Separate Algorithm Categories</h3>



<p>Put simply: Asymmetric cryptography belongs in a different API than symmetric cryptography. A similar separation should probably exist for specialized algorithms (e.g. multi-party computation and Shamir Secret Sharing).</p>



<p>Java may have got this one horribly wrong, but they’re not alone. The JWE specification (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#page-2">RFC 7518</a>) also allows you to encrypt keys with:</p>



<ul><li>RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding (asymmetric encryption)</li><li>RSA with OAEP padding (asymmetric encryption)</li><li>ECDH (asymmetric key agreement)</li><li>AES-GCM (<strong>symmetric</strong> encryption)</li></ul>



<p>If your users aren’t using a high-level abstraction, at least give them separate APIs for different algorithm types. If nothing else, it saves your users from having to ever type <code>RSA/ECB</code> again.</p>



<p>N.b. this means we should also collectively stop using the simple <code>sign</code> and <code>verify</code> verbs for Symmetric Authentication (i.e. HMAC) when these verbs imply digital signature algorithms (which are inherently asymmetric). Qualified verbs (<code>verify</code> –&gt; <code>sign_verify</code>, <code>mac_verify</code>) are okay here.</p>



<h3>4. Use Type-Safe Interfaces</h3>



<p>If you allow any arbitrary string or byte array to be passed as the key, IV, etc. in your cryptography library, someone will misuse it.</p>



<p>Instead, you should have dedicated {structs, classes, types} (select appropriate) for each different kind of cryptography key your library expects. These keys should also provide guarantees about their contents (i.e. an Aes256GcmKey is always 32 bytes).</p>



<h3>5. Defaults Matter</h3>



<p>If you instantiate a new SymmetricCipher class, its default state should be an authenticated mode; <em>never ECB</em>.</p>



<p>The default settings are the ones that 80% of real world users should be using, if not a higher percentage.</p>



<h3>6. Reduce Cognitive Load</h3>



<p>If you’re encrypting data, why should your users <em>even need to know what a nonce is</em> to use it safely?</p>



<p>You MAY allow an explicit nonce if it makes sense for their application, but if they don’t provide one, generate a random nonce and handle it for them.</p>



<p>Aside: There’s an argument that we should have a standard for <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/issues/138">committing, deterministic authenticated encryption</a>. If you need non-determinism, stick a random 256-bit nonce in the AAD and you get that property too. I liked to call this combination AHEAD (Authenticated Hedged Encryption with Associated Data), in the same vein as <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/03/hedged-signatures-with-libsodium-using-dhole/">Hedged Signatures</a>.</p>



<p>The less choices a user has to make to get their code working correctly, the less likely they’ll accidentally introduce a subtle flaw that makes their application hideously insecure.</p>



<h3>7. Don’t Fail at Failure</h3>



<p>If what you’re doing is sensitive to error oracles (e.g. padding), you have to be very careful about how you fail.</p>



<p>For example: RSA decryption with PKCS#1v1.5 padding. Doing a constant-time swap between the actual plaintext and some random throwaway value so the decryption error can result from the symmetric decryption is better than aborting.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you’re depending on a component to generate randomness for you and it fails, it shouldn’t fail silently and return bad data.</p>



<p>Security is largely about understanding how systems fail, so there’s no one-size-fits-all answer for this. However, the exact failure mechanism for a cryptographic feature should be decided very thoughtfully.</p>



<h3>8. Minimize Runtime Negotiation</h3>



<p>This is more of a concern for applications than libraries, but it bears …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em><span>Posted by Sara M. Butler; 5 February 2021.</span></em></p>



<p>In Ohio, Governor DeWine’s landmark 8 December 2020 press conference has left the future of felony execution in the state up in the air. The indefinite delay in capital punishment announced back in 2018 has turned into what DeWine is referring to as a “de facto moratorium,” as he instructs lawmakers to find some method of execution other than lethal injection. Since 2015, Ohio, like twenty-eight other American states where the death penalty remains on the books, has been struggling to find an American pharmaceutical company willing to supply sodium thiopental. A nation-wide shortage of the drug springs from the reluctance of drug companies to be openly associated with the death penalty. Past boycotts of their products across Europe have demonstrated that it is bad for business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those of us who are residents of Ohio, and not supporters of the death penalty, are heaving a sigh of relief. Ohio, in particular, has a gruesome history of botched executions by lethal injection. Sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of his cellmate, Christopher Newman was set to be executed 24 May 2007. It took them so long to find a viable artery, that he was permitted a bathroom break. In all, it took ten attempts and two hours to complete the mission.</p>



<p>Two years later, after eighteen failed attempts to insert an IV into the veins of Romell Broom, he was granted a reprieve. The pandemic forced a delay of his second scheduled execution to 2022, however, Broom passed away of natural causes 28 December 2020.</p>



<p>The most disturbing example of a botched execution took place in 2014. Dennis McGuire was subjected to a new combination of drugs, midazolam (a sedative) alongside the pain medication hydromorphone. Medical authorities warned the state that the combination might cause death by suffocation. Much to the sheer horror of those assembled at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, during 10 to 13 of the 24 minutes it took him to die, he gasped for air. Columbus <em>Dispatch</em> reported Alan Johnson stated: “He gasped deeply. It was kind of a rattling, guttural sound. There was kind of a snorting through his nose. A couple of times, he definitely appeared to be choking.”<a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p>



<p>Finally, on 15 November 2017, executioners gave up after spending an hour trying to find a viable vein for Alva Earl Campbell, Jr. The state rescheduled his execution for 15 June 2019, although he passed away from natural causes in March of 2018.</p>



<p>With such an appalling track record, it does indeed seem as if it is time to abandon lethal injection! What was once touted as a humane and painless procedure has proven to be neither in these instances. Of course, as a medievalist and living in a highly religious state, I keep wondering: does no one see the hand of God in all of this?</p>



<p>If I learned anything from Robert Bartlett’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hanged-Man-Miracle-Memory-Colonialism/dp/0691126046">The Hanged Man: A Story of Miracle, Memory, and Colonialism in the Middle Ages</a> </em>(Princeton, 2004), it is that when a convicted felon survives execution, it is a miracle. <em>The Hanged Man</em> tells the story of William Cragh, a Welsh rebel, hanged outside Swansea in 1290. After his body was removed from the gallows and carted to the local church for burial, he began to show signs of life. Lady Mary de Briouze – wife of the very man who sentenced Cragh to death – declared that divine intervention brought Cragh back to life, thanks in part to her heartfelt prayers for intercession to Thomas of Cantilupé, soon to be saint, whose canonization trial provides the evidence for Bartlett’s book. William Langland’s <em>Piers Plowman</em> confirms that this interpretation of a failed execution was not simply an obscure Welsh custom. The author writes: “It is noghte used on erthe to hangen a feloun / Ofter than ones” (<em>It is not used on Earth to hang a felon more than once)</em>. Piers Plowman, B text, 18:380-81.</p>



<p>Equipped with this knowledge, I was then astonished when I stumbled across the execution of Adam Trop, a felon hanged at Dublin in 1363, recorded in the patent rolls, whose botched execution was most definitely not interpreted as a miracle. On the assumption that he was dead, his body was thrown down from the gallows and carried to the church on a bier by a group of his friends and family. It was too dark to bury him at that point, so they left his body inside the church and planned to return the following morning to bury him in the churchyard. During the night, Adam revived. While Adam may have considered his own recovery a miracle, he did not wait around to make sure the local authorities agreed. Instead, he escaped by breaking down the doors of the church and fleeing on foot. He made the right decision. The sheriff also saw nothing miraculous in an escaped felon: he tracked Adam down to county Kildare, dragged him back to the gallows in Dublin where he hanged him for a second time, this time successfully. Neither did the king see a miracle in this failed execution: he fined the citizens and burgesses of Dublin 100 shillings for the escape, although he was eventually convinced to pardon them the exorbitant fine.<a href="#_edn2">[2]</a></p>



<p>Indeed, digging deeper into the calendars of patent and close rolls, I came across another twenty-three cases, dating to the years 1234-1381, of “hanged men” (and women) who rose from the dead, and only six of them were recognized as miracles.<a href="#_edn3">[3]</a> More often than not, these botched executions were seen instead as we would see them today: an intolerable product of human error.</p>



<p>The crown’s more usual approach was to punish those whose incompetence made the authorities look inadequate. For example, in 1280, when the knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem prepared to bury hanged man John of Ellingstring in the churchyard of St James, York, they discovered the corpse was still in fact breathing. While the king saw fit to pardon the felon, he was not prepared to turn a blind eye to incompetence: he fined the townships of Ellington, Ellingstring, Fearby, and Witton 12 marks for John’s escape.<a href="#_edn4">[4]</a></p>



<p>Similarly, the failed execution of Walter Eghe in 1285 prompted the City of Norwich to stage an inquest to better understand where they had gone wrong. They pinned the blame on William son of Thomas Stanhard who took Walter down from the gallows (assumedly for having done so too soon): he was committed to jail. Walter was in the church of St George when he revived, where he immediately claimed sanctuary. He stayed there for fifteen days, guarded by representatives from the four nearest parishes (St Peter of Hungate, St Mary the Less, St Simon and Jude, and St George). Then somehow he escaped, making it as far as the church of the Holy Trinity, also in Norwich, where he again claimed sanctuary. At that point, the king decided to issue Walter a pardon, but not before the four parishes were fined for letting him slip by their watch unnoticed.<a href="#_edn5">[5]</a></p>

<p>In July of the same year, the sheriff of Northampton imprisoned the twelve men assigned to supervise the execution of Henry Cule and his sister Agnes, both of whom “escaped alive by a fortunate chance” after “they had long been hanging.” The king eventually showed compassion to them and ordered the sheriff to deliver them to bail.<a href="#_edn6">[6]</a></p>



<p>Why did so many convicts survive their executions? Were the medieval English just hopeless when it came to hanging?</p>



<p>At times, the equipment itself was faulty. In three instances, the rope used to hang the condemned snapped.<a href="#_edn7">[7]</a> Investigations after the fact were keen to prove that it had not been helped along by those who sympathized with the plight of the accused. In 1334, when Felicia de Whichull’s rope split after she had been hanging “for a long time but was not yet dead,” the sheriff of Stratford certified that it did so “without the help of man or fraud.”<a href="#_edn8">[8]</a> They had good reason to be suspicious. Peter Kyngesgrene (1374) was cut down by certain ministers of the friary of St John when he was only half dead. They took him to the precinct of the church of St Sepulchre to prevent crown officials from getting their hands on him.<a href="#_edn9">[9]</a></p>



<p>The method itself was problematic. Hanging in the Middle Ages was accomplished by slow strangulation – pulling the rope to raise up the accused – rather than the sudden drop intended to break the condemned’s neck associated with the trapdoor that was an invention of the eighteenth century. Exactly how long it takes for life to seep from the body was the question asked in each and every investigation. For Henry and his sister Agnes, the record notes that they were left hanging “a long time”; John de la Lynde of Hereford (1332) was hanging “for the great part of a day”; Ivetta of Balsham (1264) was hanging “from the ninth hour of Monday until sunrise of the Tuesday following”; John le Ropere of Warwick (1381) was hanging “for a longer time than another felon under the same judgment” whose hanging was successful; and yet each one of them lived to tell the tale.<a href="#_edn10">[10]</a></p>



<p>And what a tale that must have been. William de Briouze’s description of William Cragh after he had been removed from the gallows gives us a glimpse of the harrowing experience:</p>







<blockquote><p>His whole face was black and in parts bloody or stained with blood. His eyes had come out of their sockets and hung outside the eyelids and the sockets were filled with blood. His mouth, neck, and throat and the parts around them, and also his nostrils, were filled with blood, so that it was impossible in the natural course of things for him to breathe air through his nostrils or through his mouth or through his throat … his tongue hung out of his mouth, the length of a man’s finger, and it was completely black and swollen and as thick with the blood sticking to it that it seemed the size of a man’s two fists together.</p><cite>Bartlett, <em>The Hanged Man</em>, 6.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Regardless of what went wrong, or whether the condemned’s clinging to life was regarded as a miracle, the one factor that unites most of these cases is the outcome: all but one (poor Adam …</p></div></div>

We will first train a so-called centralized PyTorch setup and then use it as a base to build a simple federated version involving one server and two clients.</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-0b7e4ad8dfea4eab26a8e5ff6794e960.webp" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-2223637d4e5c280c83c2ac0878af62b6.webp" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-644b84b1ab9e15a926230ffeface448e.webp" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-a62a5f76364e7a045b0733868703158f.webp" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-bcfca08444ba13a04d3db3819d18ede5.png" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-cbc4f9d3b520f5f95f4c1f500bf96133.png" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-6cf1c4f9f12f73867f0ea1e7edb858fe.png" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-bfb68ec513192c5b101f984868b114aa.png" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><img src="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/pytorch_flower_logo-bfb68ec513192c5b101f984868b114aa.png" alt="PyTorch and Flower Logo being connected"></picture></div></div><p><em>PyTorch, the PyTorch logo and any related marks are trademarks of Facebook, Inc.</em></p><h2>Centralized PyTorch Training</h2><p>PyTorch is one of the most popular machine learning frameworks.
It allows users to create different types of deep learning algorithms with many possibilities to customize them for specific use cases.
The centralized training part of this blog post follows the basic <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py">PyTorch CIFAR-10 tutorial</a> and consists of four components: loading the data via <code>load_data</code>, defining the CNN in a call called <code>Net</code>, training the CNN using the <code>train</code> function, and finally evaluating the trained model using the <code>test</code> function.</p><p>The following code snippet shows how these components are called in a centralized training setup. Full implementation details of each of those components can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/examples/pytorch_from_centralized_to_federated/cifar.py">cifar.py</a>.</p><p>First, the CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and used to create one <code>DataLoader</code> for the training set and another <code>DataLoader</code> for the test set. The training set is used to train the simple CNN that is defined in the <code>Net</code> class. After the training is done, the test set is used to evaluate the previously trained CNN.</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>():</span><span>

Our client (e.g. in a script called <code>client.py</code>) will now connect Flower to the code we previously used in the centralized setup.</p><p>Let's start with the required imports, most notably Flower (<code>flwr</code>), PyTorch (<code>torch</code> and <code>torchvision</code>), and our old friend <code>cifar.py</code>:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>from</span><span> collections </span><span>import</span><span> OrderedDict

Our client class is the point where we connect Flower to our custom PyTorch training code.
We will implement four methods: <code>get_parameters()</code>, <code>set_parameters()</code>, <code>fit</code>, and <code>evaluate</code>.</p><p>The Flower client stores both our CNN (class <code>Net</code> from <code>cifar.py</code>) and the training and test set <code>DataLoader</code> as instance variables.
The two methods <code>set_parameters()</code> and <code>get_parameters()</code> are used to update the parameters (or weights) of our CNN.
In Federated Learning, we usually update the local model with the global model parameters received from the server (i.e., <code>set_parameters()</code>) and then train the model on the local data. Afterwards, the locally updated model parameters are returned back to the server (i.e., <code>get_parameters()</code>).</p><p>The <code>fit()</code> method does exactly that: it receives the CNN model weights (argument <code>parameters</code>) as a list of NumPy <code>ndarray</code>s from the server, updates the local model (via <code>self.set_parameters(parameters)</code>), and then performs training using the training set by calling the <code>train</code> function (<code>cifar.train()</code> from our centralized training project). Finally, it returns the updated model weight using <code>self.get_parameters()</code> (along with the number of training examples).</p><p>The <code>evaluate()</code> method is working in a similar way, but instead of training it calculates the loss and accuracy on our test set using the previously defined <code>cifar.test()</code>).</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>class</span><span> </span><span>CifarClient</span><span>(</span><span>fl.client.NumPyClient</span><span>):</span><span>

You've learned how an existing centralized PyTorch project can be federated with Flower.
And we didn't even have to change anything about the existing project, we just added the code for federated learning in two additional files and made them use the existing building blocks.
You can now start to experiment with your project.
How about starting more clients?
We should also start to use a different subset of the data on each client to have a more realistic simulation.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/advanced_tensorflow">advanced TensorFlow example</a> for more ideas.</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</em></p>

<p>If you read my profile from my high-school yearbook for the class of 2011, you’ll find the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tom is a man who takes pleasure in doing exactly the opposite of everyone[, such as his] early adoption of Bitcoin, a universal currency more inherently worthless than the Zimbabwean Dollar”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In truth, I didn’t really own any Bitcoin, at least not enough to be meaningful even today. I’d tried mining a bit on my 2006 Macbook, but back then people were giving it away for free in an effort to kick-start the crypto-economy. The focus of the ‘Bitcoin community’ in those days was on building a real, workable currency – in other words, it was yet to become the crypto-Marxist doomsday cult it is in 2021. Certainly lots of the people involved in it had a strong libertarian, anti-Fed ethos, but that was secondary: the sort of things people wanted to buy with bitcoins were pizzas and beer. The early bitcoiner’s idea of bitcoin’s success was it being accepted as legal tender at your local bar.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2021 and that dream is further away than ever. Spending bitcoin is one of the most difficult things you can do. I’m going to be generous and leave aside all of the technical problems around transaction costs, the time it takes for transactions to be added to the blockchain, and other such matters which can probably (or have been) solved.</p>

<p>Let’s examine why I can’t buy a beer with bitcoin today [1]. As of writing (and this will surely become quickly out of date), bitcoin’s market cap has exceeded $1tn. By comparison, there are just under 50 billion Swiss Francs in circulation today, which are worth around $56bn USD. However, despite having under 6% of the market cap of bitcoin, you will find tens of thousands of businesses which will gladly sell you goods and services for your Swiss Franks (they all just happen to be in Switzerland). Why, despite this huge market cap, has bitcoin fundamentally failed to enter our daily lives?</p>

<p>A currency only works when there are enough buyers and sellers on each side. This much is obvious. However, the subtlety that’s lost here is that there have to be buyers and sellers on both sides who are also interested in buying and selling things other than bitcoin! You can find people all over the world who are willing to trade Pokemon cards, even some people willing to pay hard currency, but you can’t build an economy out of them because the people trading Pokemon cards are only interested in trading Pokemon cards for cash, or vice-versa. And in a liquid market, why would a business owner accept Pokemon cards when you can just insist they trade their cards for cash first?</p>

<p>What’s so strange about all of this is that it totally flies in the face of Bitcoin’s original vision. It’s telling that, if you read Satoshi Nakamoto original whitepaper [2], monetary policy, the fed, or currency debasing aren’t even mentioned (the word “currency” appears only once). The original purpose of bitcoin was to solve the very specific problem of transferring value between two parties without the need for an intermediary – the word “transaction” appears 69 times. Not only do people not use bitcoin for goods and services in this way today, they largely don’t even trade cryptocurrencies in this way! Most trades happen on big, centralised platforms, which are vulnerable to government shutdowns, theft, or technical issues.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then what’s the point of owning bitcoin? And why have so many people decided that it’s worth a lot of USD to own bitcoin?</p>

<p>What has happened in the last year or so is that a fringe idea – the idea that the Fed engages in regular debasement of the US dollar, which is the reserve currency of the world – suddenly went mainstream in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m not going to opine too much on the validity of this view – I think it’s basically true, and that all of the risks the bitcoin bulls point out regarding modern monetary policy (lower-case or upper-case) are real and worrisome. Relatedly, when reading Marx, I can nod along with the correct diagnosis of the ills of capitalism. Where he loses me is his belief in the inevitability of a revolution which will bring about a socialist utopia which will usher in a reign of peace and love, and everyone gets a mansion.</p>

<p>This utopian/dystopian binary mindset is the fatal flaw. Communism was the 20th century’s “idea that eats smart people”. More recently it was the Singularity (I highly recommend you read this excellent essay on the subject: [3]). Today it’s bitcoin. What all these three things have in common is that they are the careful, sophisticated, and elegant application of pure reason. Like a well-crafted conspiracy theory, they glide from precept to conclusion along an unbroken chain of impeccable logic [4]. Unfortunately for them is that the world does not fit neatly into Platonic forms of Revolution, Superintelligence or (what I’ve only recently heard referred to as ) “The Flippening”.</p>

<p>“The Flippening” is the idea that hyperinflation of the USD is inevitable and imminent, and that therefore Bitcoin is the One True store of value. By their logic, holding onto any currency is akin to holding onto sand as it runs through your fingers – your hard work which earned it literally turning it to dust as the US government debases the global reserve currency to pay for ever spiralling public services bills, military spending, and bailing out American Big Business. And I basically agree with this – Bitcoin is a good hedge against the US dollar dropping its status as the global reserve currency. With a $1tn market cap, mathematically provably limited supply, and the complete freedom from the clutches of any individual or nation state, what else could it be?</p>

<p>But this is not the only possible outcome. And perhaps, most damning, I don’t even think it’s a very likely outcome.</p>

<p>A general point about investing: if the price of an asset is closely tied to the probability of a particular future event, and you disagree with the probability that the market assigns to it, then in your view that asset is mispriced. It’s hard to measure what the actual probability of an event like The Flippening is, but what isn’t so hard to measure is how pervasive this narrative has suddenly become. The problem with Bitcoin is that, although you can’t just print more of it, you can get Elon Musk to retweet it endlessly. Bitcoin’s price goes up as a function of retweets in a similar way to how the stock market goes up as a function of the Fed printing dollars.</p>

<p>Gamestop should have been the wake-up call. No one bought Gamestop because they thought its stock would become the reserve currency of the future, but perhaps they might as well have done. People were buying and holding GME because other people were buying and holding GME (and because some people were forced to buy GME). Similar to Bitcoin, there was a narrative that started with an observation in early 2020 that GMEs financials weren’t in as bad shape as the market seemed to think, and that the company had a good shot at a turnaround, and morphed into the narrative that big hedge funds had huge short positions which they would be forced to cover if enough retail investors bought the stock. After climbing 1800% in 20 days, it eventually fell back to a pedestrian 4x multiple over its 2020 trading value. The party was over.</p>

<p>What GME demonstrated was the power of the meme in the stock market, and that an asset price could increase its value by over 20x for no fundamental reason. People point to the rising price of bitcoin as evidence of the truth in their narratives, but the reality is that bitcoin could be rising for no reason at all.</p>

<p>Ok, so maybe bitcoin specifically is overpriced – what about other crypto as a hedge against the USD? Imagine a revolutionary new asset class that’s fungible, has a finite supply, and whose supply is decentralised. Actually, this sounds a lot like gold. Is gold all that great? Well, the main benefit that crypto has over gold is that (a) as well as weighing gold you need to verify its purity, which is expensive to do for every transaction; and (b) gold can’t be transmitted over the internet. But if you don’t care about buying stuff, then gold is a pretty good way to store value: you can keep it at home and ‘be your own bank’ (with all the hazards that entails), store it in a safe-deposit box, or just buy some as a paper commodity – the exact same options open to crypto currency traders (with the nice bonus that you can actually get insurance up to certain amounts if you decide to go down the safe-deposit route). If you can’t buy stuff with crypto then there’s really no advantage to it over gold at all.</p>

<p>In summary, there are two reasonable arguments (and one spectacularly bad one) for buying bitcoin/crypto:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The believer</strong>: You believe in the imminent ‘Flippening’ in which you and all your crypto buddies are unimaginably rich in a post-USD economic wasteland</li>
  <li><strong>The hedger</strong>: You don’t necessarily believe in the ‘Flippening’ but are worried about inflation and want an asset which won’t lose value in the future</li>
  <li><strong>The speculator</strong>: Price always goes up [rocket emojis]</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) needs you to buy into a messianic world-view, and, similar to how there are many religions which purport to worship the ‘one true god’, there are many cryptocurrencies which you can own, and many ways the rapture could play out. My non-consensus view is that, like every single other time there is a mass-hysteria that we are approaching the ‘end of history’, history will chug along all the same, fiat currencies and all. (2) seems a bit more reasonable on the face of it, but you can get all of the benefits with almost none of the volatility from buying gold. That leaves (3), to which I can only say, if you can get in while the price is going up and get out before the institutions do, profiting off the ‘true …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> EPFL engineers, working in association with startup Xsensio, have developed a wearable sensing chip that can measure the concentration of cortisol – the stress hormone – in human sweat. Enabling future quasi-continuous monitoring, their device can eventually help doctors better understand and treat stress-related conditions like burnout and obesity.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>We’ve all felt stressed at some point, whether in our personal or professional lives or in response to exceptional circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic. But until now there has been no way to quantify stress levels in an objective manner.&nbsp;</p><p>That could soon change thanks to a small wearable sensor developed by engineers at EPFL’s Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab) and Xsensio. The device&nbsp;has the potential to be placed directly on a patient’s skin in a wearable patch and, in the future, to quasi-continually&nbsp;measure the concentration of cortisol, the main stress biomarker, in the patient’s sweat.</p><p><strong>Cortisol: A double-edged sword</strong></p><p>Cortisol is a steroid hormone made by our adrenal glands out of cholesterol. Its secretion is controlled by the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is produced by the pituitary gland. Cortisol carries out essential functions in our bodies, such as regulating metabolism, blood sugar levels and blood pressure; it also affects the immune system and cardiovascular functions.</p><p>When we’re in a stressful situation, whether life-threatening or mundane, cortisol is the hormone that takes over. It instructs our bodies to direct the required energy to our brain, muscles and heart. “Cortisol can be secreted on impulse – you feel fine and suddenly something happens that puts you under stress, and your body starts producing more of the hormone,” says Adrian Ionescu, head of Nanolab.</p><p>While cortisol helps our bodies respond to stressful situations, it’s actually a double-edged sword. It’s usually secreted throughout the day according to a circadian rhythm, peaking between 6am and 8am and then gradually decreasing into the afternoon and evening. “But in people who suffer from stress-related diseases, this circadian rhythm is completely thrown off,” says Ionescu. “And if the body makes too much or not enough cortisol, that can seriously damage an individual’s health, potentially leading to obesity, cardiovascular disease, depression or burnout.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="343" src="https://actu.epfl.ch/static/upload/fckeditorimage/a0/a8/3a256b45.jpg" width="335"><figcaption><em>Qualitative depiction of regular and irregular circadian levels throughout the day. © Nanolab, EPFL</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Capturing the hormone to measure it</strong></p><p>Blood tests can be used to take snapshot measurements of patients’ cortisol levels. However, detectable amounts of cortisol can also be found in saliva, urine and sweat. Ionescu’s team at Nanolab decided to focus on sweat as the detection fluid and developed a wearable smart patch with a miniaturized sensor.&nbsp;</p><p>The patch contains a transistor and an electrode made from graphene which, due to its unique proprieties, offers high sensitivity and very low detection limits. The graphene is functionalized through aptamers, which are short fragments of single-stranded DNA or RNA that can bind to specific compounds. The aptamer in the EPFL patch carries a negative charge; when it comes into contact with cortisol, it immediately captures the hormone, causing the strands to fold onto themselves and bringing the charge closer to the electrode surface. The device then detects the charge, and is consequently able to measure the cortisol concentration in the wearer’s sweat.</p><figure><img alt="" height="212" src="https://actu.epfl.ch/static/upload/fckeditorimage/ea/82/7aa606c4.jpg" width="802"><figcaption><em>Process flow for capturing cortisol with the graphene electrode and aptamers. © Nanolab, EPFL</em></figcaption></figure><p>So far, no other system has been developed for monitoring cortisol concentrations continuously throughout the circadian cycle. “That’s the key advantage and innovative feature of our device. Because it can be worn, scientists can collect quantitative, objective data on certain stress-related diseases. And they can do so in a non-invasive, precise and instantaneous manner over the full range of cortisol concentrations in human sweat,” says Ionescu.</p><p><strong>Engineering improved healthcare</strong></p><p>The engineers tested their device on Xsensio’s proprietary Lab-on-Skin<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;platform; the next step will be to place it in the hands of healthcare workers. Esmeralda Megally, CEO of Xsensio, says: “The joint R&amp;D team at EPFL and Xsensio reached an important R&amp;D milestone in the detection of the cortisol hormone. We look forward to testing this new sensor in a hospital setting and unlocking new insight into how our body works.” The team has set up a bridge project with Prof. Nelly Pitteloud, chief of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), for her staff to try out the continuous cortisol-monitoring system on human patients. These trials will involve healthy individuals as well as people suffering from Cushing’s syndrome (when the body produces too much cortisol), Addison’s disease (when the body doesn’t produce enough) and stress-related obesity.&nbsp;The engineers believe their sensor can make a major contribution to the study of the physiological and pathological rhythms of cortisol secretion.</p><p>So what about psychological diseases caused by too much stress? “For now, they are assessed based only on patients’ perceptions and states of mind, which are often subjective,” says Ionescu. “So having a reliable, wearable sensor can help doctors objectively quantify whether a patient is suffering from depression or burnout, for example, and whether their treatment is effective. What’s more, doctors would have that information in real time. That would mark a major step forward in the understanding of these diseases.” And who knows, maybe one day this technology will be incorporated into smart bracelets. “The next phase will focus on product development to turn this exciting invention into a key part of our Lab-on-Skin<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;sensing platform, and bring stress monitoring to next-generation wearables,” says Megally.</p></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>
<p>If you imagine your organization as a sea-faring vessel, infosec’s goal is to ensure the boat can survive krakens or canon-wielding pirates and successfully complete its journey. If you ignore the existence of sea terrors, you may not make it to your destination unless Poseidon grants you merciful passage. If you prioritize defense above your vessel’s mission, you will find yourself aboard a battleship that is entirely inadequate for transporting revenue-generating cargo. — <a href="https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/on-yolosec-and-fomosec/">On YOLOsec and FOMOsec</a>, Kelly Shortridge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Startups are all about focusing on the right thing at the right time. Juggling everything through the fog of product development, managing your runway, and growing a team are tough on their own. Unless it’s a primary piece of your product offering<sup>1</sup>, security is rarely prioritized in the early days of a startup. Contemporary startups have the benefit of the accumulation of best practices becoming more commonplace and accessible: appsec best practices get caught in code reviews, infrastructure providers bias toward secure defaults, engineers are accustomed to using things like password managers and MFA apps. However, beyond that, founders in search of product-market-fit do not have the cycles to focus on infosec. It’s a type of technical debt that is accrued while focus is elsewhere.</p>

<p>As your traction begins to grow, paying down technical debt becomes a recurring focus for the team. This typically takes the form of application, infrastructure, and ops related debt. Preventing the CEO from accidentally deleting the production database is a more immediate threat than a targeted attack. Improving your processes to prevent shooting yourself in the foot will pay immediate dividends. Solving your startup’s problems around self-incurred outages and  data loss are more pressing than infosec.</p>

<p>There is no positive benefit when it comes to security — the best outcome you can expect and actually aim to get is a reduction of negative impact.  Your product or customer experience is not directly improved by an increased security posture. However, the amount of downside is unknown and potentially large. This is what will start keeping the founders up at night. Peace of mind. It all changes when there’s now something at stake. Reputation. Customer trust.  Reliability. Anything that’ll erode that hard earned product market fit. Any bad press that’ll reduce the slope of your week over week growth.</p>

<p>This is the right time a startup should start prioritizing infosec.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.goldfiglabs.com/uploads/2021/879e082f89.jpg" width="600" alt="The Startup Curve Overlayed with paying down tech debt and when to start thinkinga bout infosec "></p>

<p><small><a href="https://avc.com/2012/03/the-startup-curve/">The Startup Curve</a> - Overlayed with paying down tech debt and when to start thinking about infosec</small></p>

<p>For all the fear-mongering related to security that’s out there, even for well-established companies, security’s priority with respect to product can be a tricky thing to pin down. Is it just another sign off like legal review? Was it just bolted on because an enterprise sale necessitated it?  The earlier your startup weaves infosec into the engineering culture, the longer head start you have in paying down security related technical debt. The dividends you get from this yields a resilient engineering organization which treats security as a partner in building the product and not an impediment.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Some other scenarios where security is an early priority for a startup. 1) Product mandated security considerations: it’s in the value prop of the product, mandated by a vendor (i.e. using the GMail API requires an external security audit); 2) Externally mandated security considerations: Government or industry regulatory considerations; product penalties if you are non-formant (i.e. amount of loan origination that can be a penalty if your banking startup is fails external security audits); 3) Customer mandated considerations: AWS GovCloud, SOC2, etc  — it’s forced by the need to acquire specific customers and/or drive sales.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-area" data-v-32226556="" data-v-12eddcfd=""><p>For a lot of applications, reset password functionality is an afterthought, slapped on shortly before launch and never revisited. "Oh yeah, we need a forgot password form! Let's toss that onto the scrum board." As a result, reset password flows are often clunky, unfriendly experiences.</p>
<p>At Mailclerk, we want to help companies implement a first-class user experience throughout all of their application email. This post provides some data-driven best practices by looking at examples of how different applications handle resetting passwords and account recovery.</p>

<p>To collect data for this post, I attempted to reset my password on 105 different applications and websites. I don't claim these are perfectly representative of all websites out there; developer-focused SaaS companies (e.g. <a href="https://www.contentful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contentful</a>, <a href="http://newrelic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewRelic</a>, <a href="http://npm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm</a>) are overrepresented because I already had a lot of accounts with them. But I've also included retail websites (e.g. <a href="https://www.rei.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI</a>, <a href="http://bookshop.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bookshop.org</a>), transportation applications (e.g. <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City Bike NYC</a>), utility companies (e.g. <a href="https://www.coned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Con Edison</a>, <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-Mobile</a>) and other industries to widen my perspective. I've included some of the largest presences on the internet (<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>) as well as some much smaller ones (<a href="https://www.dstld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSTLD</a>, <a href="https://lichess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lichess</a>).</p>
<p>Throughout this post, I include some screenshots of things we at Mailclerk think are great examples of email UX, and some that aren't quite as good. If you're reading this from an organization we critique, please don't take it personally; this is all in pursuit of helping the world send beautiful and usable email! (We'd also <em>love</em> to help you out with your emails. Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:friends@mailclerk.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friends@mailclerk.app</a> 😉).</p>
<p>You can jump to the <a href="#conclusion">end of this post</a> to see our summary of best practices plus the raw data, or <a href="#hall-of-fame">here</a> if you just want to see some excellent examples.</p>
<h2 id="reset-method">Reset Method</h2>
<p>The most common way to let someone into their account when they've forgotten their password is to send them a link with a unique token that allows them to set a new one. We call this the "reset link" method. This is the classic. Since it's so common, you can be fairly sure your users won't need much coaching for this to work. Of the 105 applications we looked at, 83 used this method. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eventbrite</a> is a well-executed, simple example:</p>

<p>But this isn't the only method! Increasingly common is the use of one-time passwords (or <em>OTPs</em>, different from the usage in fanfiction 💕), where people are sent a short code or PIN by email or SMS that they enter into the application. This serves the same basic purpose as reset links: it confirms you still control the email (or phone number) you signed up with.</p>
<p>17 applications sent OTPs by either email or SMS. Four of these (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lemonade</a>) sent OTPs by text message <em>only</em>, taking them out of the scope of this (email-only) analysis.</p>
<p>It is notable that <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, some of the largest social networks and identify providers, all use the OTP method. Here is how Twitter does it:</p>

<p>A handful of applications made their own path:</p>
<ul>
<li>One application (<a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI</a>) <em>only</em> allows access via SSO, which means they can completely sidestep password management.</li>
<li>Another (<a href="https://www.metabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metabase</a>) doesn't allow password resets at all; people are prompted to ask their admins to reset their passwords for them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple/iCloud</a> sends a push notification to one of your Apple devices. If you happen to make a device with the same reach as the iPhone, you should consider this method!</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> sends a new randomly generated password by email that Wikipedians can log in with:</p>

<p>I'm not sure why Wikipedia is going their own way with the reset password methodology here; I suspect this has something to do with the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&amp;returnto=Main+Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emails are not actually required to sign up</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Either a reset link or reset OTP will work. People may be less familiar with the use of OTPs, and so using reset links may generate less friction. However, OTPs may have some slight security benefits over password reset, as indicated by the major identity providers using it.</p>
<h2 id="subject-line">Subject line</h2>
<p>So far in this post we've been referring to "resetting passwords." This phrase, or variants on it, is used in 89% of email subjects we looked at. Some common variations:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Reset your password</td>
<td>8 emails, all identical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{{APPLICATION NAME}} password reset</td>
<td>11 emails</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reset your {{APPLICATION NAME}} password</td>
<td>8 emails</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The other common pattern is to call this process "account recovery" or variants on that.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> 6% of subject lines do so. Examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Steam Account Recovery</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account Recovery - Stack Overflow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mailgun account recovery instructions</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For applications using OTPs, the email subject generally directly reference either the "code" or, less often, the "PIN". Examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Google Verification Code Code</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{{NAME}}, here's your PIN</td>
<td><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{{OTP CODE}} is your Facebook account recovery code</td>
<td><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> (and <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a>) includes the code in the subject</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, here are a few subject lines with a bit more personality:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>🔑 Password Reset</td>
<td><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duolingo</a>, getting points for being the only email with an emjoi in the subject line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your password reset instructions…</td>
<td><a href="https://www.dstld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSTLD</a> feels a little hesitant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ask and you shall receive... a password reset</td>
<td><a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a> has a better handle on the effective use of the ellipsis</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Many emails included the application name in the subject. This is particularly important for applications that don't send with their organization's name tied to the FROM address. Points docked from Shutterfly, APA League, The Economist, Amtrak, and David's Tea for doing neither, making their emails very hard to identify in my inbox:</p>

<p>If you don't have easy control over the "from" names on your application emails, <a href="https://mailclerk.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailclerk can help with that</a>. 😉</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Be very clear in the subject line what the email is for (resetting your password/recovering your account). If it fits your application's tone, consider a small splash of humor. Make sure to include the name of your application as either the sender name or in the subject line.

<p>However, a surprisingly large number of templated emails include URLs in plaintext, instead of or in addition to a button. Of the 66 templated emails in our dataset that use the reset password method, 10 have reset URLs in plaintext instead of a button. The result is often jarring, like this email from <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio</a>:</p>

<p>Why do so many emails have plaintext URLs? At the dawn of templated emails, this was a good practice because not all email clients were able parse HTML emails, and so buttons wouldn't have displayed or been clickable. These URLs (and the advice to copy and paste them into a browser) was for their benefit.</p>
<p>Here in 2021, very few (if any) of your customers will be using email clients that can't display HTML emails. For <a href="https://useplaintext.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those that are</a>, they're best served by your sending plaintext versions of your emails in addition to the styled HTML version, which you should definitely do anyway for deliverability reasons.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> The plaintext version should convert the button to a plaintext URL automatically. Here's what the plaintext version of that minimal Freedom.to email looks like:</p>

<p>We think the main reason this practice persists is people blindly copying other’s email design. Application email rarely gets the attention it deserves. (We are trying to change this!) Pointless email patterns perpetuate via people mimicking existing emails without pausing to think.</p>
<p>If you feel like you <em>must</em> include a plaintext link but still want to use a heavily-styled email template, consider adding the link to the footer of the email. We like how the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> handles this:</p>

<p>In general though, we don't think it's necessary to include links in plaintext or instructions to copy URLs into a web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> If you're sending email using a styled HTML template, use a button instead of a URL for password reset CTAs. Plaintext URLs are okay in minimally styled templates. Always make sure to provide a plaintext alternative to HTML.</p>
<h2 id="expiration-time">Expiration Time</h2>
<p>With both the reset password and OTP methods, it is imporant to make links and OTPs expire after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Otherwise, passwords could be changed long after they were sent, perhaps after the account in question was transferred to someone else (and the associated email changed) or perhaps if someone screenshot the emails in question and put them into a blog post.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Just because you make your links expire doesn't mean you need to tell people they do in the email though. 62% of the applications we looked at don't specify an expiration date in reset password emails. We expect that the vast majority of these companies do in fact implement links and code expiration. They just think it is distracting or unnecessary to draw attention to the expiration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> splits the difference, coyly telling you the link will expire at some point but not telling you when:</p>

<p>Times until expiration varies from 15 minutes (<a href="https://www.blueshieldca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blueshield of CA</a>) up to 7 days (<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>). Furthermore, there isn't a clear pattern based on the sensitivity of data or level of regulation. Blueshield of CA and <a href="https://www.citymd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CityMD</a> accounts both contain sensitive health user data, but are on wildly different extremes for expiration time. <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a> and <a href="https://segment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segment</a> grant access to potentially sensitive application data, but links for MongoDB expire 12x faster than Segment's.</p>

<p><strong>Elsie</strong> allows you to <strong>create slides programmatically</strong> using Python. It is a Python library
that lets you build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> slides in a
composable way and then render them to PDF. There is no DSL or GUI – presentations created with
<em>Elsie</em> are fully programmed with Python.</p>
<p>It was created out of frustration of having to deal with
<a href="#comparison-to-other-tools">existing tools</a> for creating technically oriented
presentations. We believe that creating presentations in a programmable way
makes the slide-making process more smooth and reliable.</p>

fine-tuned SVG image by hand e.g. in <code>Inkscape</code> and let <em>Elsie</em> turn it into an animation using a
handy <a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/images/#embedding-fragments-in-images">layer-naming convention</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Source code highlighting</strong> Enjoy beautiful code snippets thanks to built-in
<a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/syntax_highlighting/">source code highlighting</a>. Create code walkthroughs using
individual <a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/syntax_highlighting/#line-and-inline-boxes">line highlighting</a> or
<a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/shapes/#arrow-heads">arrows</a> pointing to specific code elements.</p>

<p><strong>Batteries included</strong> Leverage familiar SVG features - fonts, colors, dashed line borders.
Include <code>PNG/JPG/SVG/ORA</code> images or render <a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/markdown/">Markdown</a> or
<a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/latex/">LaTeX</a> directly into your slides. Build your slides interactively in
<a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/jupyter/">Jupyter notebooks</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Familiarity</strong> At its heart, <em>Elsie</em> is a streamlined API for creating SVG images, optimized for
making presentations. If you know the basics of Python and SVG, you'll be right at home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate feature of <em>Elsie</em> is that it allows you to build slides using (an imperative)
programming language. You can split a large presentation into several modules/files, parametrize
animations or objects that appear often using functions, create arbitrarily complex slides and
animations or interactively modify the font, aspect ratio or text color/size of your whole
presentation by changing a single line of code.</p>
<p><em>Every tool has its disadvantages though.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Elsie</em> provides a rather low-level API. While that means that you can create a slide in almost
any way you like, you will sometimes have to roll up your sleeves to achieve your desired goal.
However, once you implement it, you can put it inside a function and reuse it the next time, or
send us a <a href="https://github.com/spirali/elsie/pulls">Pull Request</a> to share the functionality with
others.</li>
<li><em>Elsie</em> produces PDF slides, so it can only create animations with a single frame per page.
If you need 60 FPS animations or GIFs in your presentations, this tool is not for you.</li>
<li><em>Elsie</em> is tested only on Linux. If you find a problem on a different platform, do not hesitate
to open a <a href="https://github.com/spirali/elsie/issues/new">GitHub issue</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Google slides/PowerPoint</strong>
These tools are fine if you need to make a bunch of very simple slides quickly, but using them
gets very annoying if you need anything more complex. You need to place all items manually,
alignment is usually a mess, fragments (animations) are not supported very well. If you need to
change some small detail (placement, style, color) of a thing that is repeated on many slides, you
pretty much have to go through all the slides and modify them by hand, one by one. Displaying source
code with syntax highlighting is notoriously badly supported, so often you have to resort to
exporting the highlighted code from <a href="https://carbon.sh/">carbon.sh</a> or screenshotting it from your
IDE, both of which are far from ideal. Also, you can't really use source control (e.g. <code>git</code>) to
version your slides, which is a shame.</p>
<p>However, PowerPoint does allow you to create continuous animations (if you do not export to PDF
of course), so if you need that, it might be a good choice. It also has a myriad of other
useful features, like tables, charts, shared templates, spell checking, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LaTeX/Beamer</strong>
LaTeX has a template called <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/beamer">Beamer</a>, which is
designed for creating presentation slides. It produces fine-looking text, has good support for
syntax highlighting and can be versioned easily. However, in our experience it is not that easy to
create custom diagrams and animations using LaTeX, mainly because of its declarative nature
(and somewhat confusing syntax). If you can speak fluently in
<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package">TikZ</a> and you can understand the error messages
of <code>pdflatex</code>, you are probably fine. If not, creating slides with complex animations, diagrams and
source code snippets might be easier for you in Python.</p>
<p>While <em>Elsie</em> also has basic support for rendering <a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/latex/">LaTeX</a>, if your
presentation is mostly composed of math formulas, it might be easier to create it in LaTeX
directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reveal.js</strong>
<a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a> is a great tool for making HTML presentations. It supports syntax
highlighting, has good-looking animations and can be versioned. However, it shares some disadvantages
of LaTeX/Beamer, which stems from the fact that it is also declarative. Creating an animation that
would walk line-by-line through a source code snippet or that would repeatedly display and hide
objects in custom fragments is difficult. You can actually use JavaScript to create more complex
animations, but it's not integrated very well, and the library itself does not offer you any API
to make it easier.</p>
<p>That being said, if you are fine with declarative description of slides, and you prefer
HTML/CSS to Python/SVG, <code>reveal.js</code> is a fine choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prezi</strong>
If you like presentations with three or more dimensions, it's a good choice. Otherwise, the
disadvantages of PowerPoint also apply here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>python-pptx</strong>
<a href="https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-pptx</a> is an API for building PowerPoint
presentations, which is great if you like PowerPoint (or you are forced to use it), because it
gives you access to a lot of its features (like tables, charts, slide notes) for free. On the
other hand, this also means that you are limited by what can PowerPoint do. Creating complex
fragment animations, pretty syntax highlighted source code snippets or LaTeX equations will
probably be nigh impossible using this library.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ<a href="#faq" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why don't you use an existing layout model, e.g. <code>flexbox</code>?</strong>
We made the <a href="https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/layout/">layout model</a> tailored for presentations, which might not be
so easy with a general layout model. We also couldn't find any usable binding of a standalone and

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In this post, we will discuss the following:</p><ol><li>The historical advantages and disadvantages to on-prem software deployments.</li><li>The ways Kubernetes makes it easier to deploy software to on-prem customer environments.</li><li>The remaining challenges with on-prem deployments that Kubernetes does not currently solve.</li></ol><p>On-prem software deployments have gotten a bad rap, at least from the perspective of the vendors that build and support such software. This reputation has been largely justified. In comparison to their cloud-hosted/SaaS counterparts, on-prem products are generally much more difficult to deploy, manage, and maintain. That being said, there are strong benefits to on-prem deployments, or else no one would bother (more on those later).</p><p>Enter Kubernetes. Kubernetes has dramatically shifted the tradeoffs of on-prem versus SaaS deployments. Thanks to the rich abstractions that Kubernetes provides, deploying a software product to a customer's on-prem environment can be significantly easier than before. Because Kubernetes has achieved such <a href="https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high market penetration</a> (and still growing), it is now a viable target environment for many B2B software products.</p><p>In response to this shift, companies such as <a href="https://www.okera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okera</a>, <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sourcegraph</a> (self-hosted offering), and <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixie Labs have</a> decided to deploy their products directly on customers' Kubernetes clusters, rather than in a hosted cloud/SaaS environment. At Pixie Labs, we predict that more B2B tools will move to support deploying on-prem to their customers' Kubernetes clusters, a mirror of the most recent shift where many applications moved from on-prem to SaaS.</p><h2>What is on-prem?</h2><p>First, let's quickly define "on-prem" because that can mean different things to different people. Some people define "on-prem" to be running on a bare metal server environment, with machines managed by the customer themselves. We take a broader definition, where "on-prem" refers to deploying directly on the customer's servers, wherever they may be.
As long as it is running directly on a customer's environment rather than a hosted cloud, this includes all of the following:</p><ul><li>Bare metal servers (including air-gapped without external network connection)</li><li>Virtual private cloud</li><li>Managed cloud environment (such as ECS, GKE/AKS/EKS, etc)</li></ul><h2>Which applications should be considered for on-prem?</h2><p>Not all applications make sense to run on-prem in the first place. Some applications can live entirely in a vendor's hosted cloud and don't need to interact with a customer environment, such as a customer relationship management (CRM) product like Salesforce or JIRA. However, other types of applications may have heavy dependencies on the customer environment. For example, a log analytics tool will likely need to read a lot of data from a customer's production system. These types of tools are more likely to be a fit for an on-prem deployment. There are also business model reasons that will affect the decision, which are touched on below. However, the major emphasis is placed on the technical landscape shifts created by Kubernetes.</p><h2>Pros and cons of on-prem (summary)</h2><p>The table below summarizes the pros/cons we have historically seen for on-prem deployments. Each item gets more detail in the next section.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pros</th><th scope="col">Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Customer data privacy (data remains in their environment)</td><td>Heterogeneous customer environments create higher technical complexity</td></tr><tr><td>Customer pays hosting costs (enables shipping "free" software)</td><td>Limited vendor visibility into bugs, crashes, and other problems</td></tr><tr><td>Support for more environments, such as air-gapped environments in finance/government</td><td>Vendor does not control deployed version</td></tr><tr><td>Lower network utilization (no need to export customer data to a remote cloud)</td><td>Orchestration and self-healing logic must be built out</td></tr><tr><td>Increased customer control over system</td><td>Resource utilization of system must be carefully managed</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Advantages of on-prem</h2><p>There are five major advantages to on-prem software deployments that we would like to highlight in this post.</p><h3>🟢 Customer data privacy</h3><p>Customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to their private data being shipped to remote clouds that they don't control. For certain types of highly sensitive data (logs, user information, etc), it can be tough to impossible to convince customers to take the risk of exporting that data outside their system.</p><h3>🟢 Customer pays hosting costs</h3><p>When an application runs on-prem and stores customer data on-prem, the software vendor doesn't need to pass on the hosting costs to the end user and can offer a free or cheaper plan than SaaS competitors. This is nearly mandatory for open source solutions, which can't afford to pay to host their entire user base.</p><h3>🟢 Support for more customer environments</h3><p>Many customer environments, especially in fields like finance or government, are air gapped (no external network connection). It isn't possible to connect those environments to a vendor's remote cloud so products requiring such a connection are dead on arrival from a sales perspective.</p><h3>🟢 Lower network utilization</h3><p>SaaS applications often ingest significant amounts of data from their customer's production environment. Exporting large amounts of data to a remote SaaS environment can put a significant burden on the network resources of the customer's production system.</p><h3>🟢 Increased customer control over the system</h3><p>Many customers strongly prefer the ability to control the applications that they purchase, and are frustrated when there is downtime of SaaS applications which they can't fix. When a product deploys on-prem, the customer has the ability to have much greater control over the system and address issues as they arise, rather than being at the mercy of the vendor.</p><h2>Historical disadvantages of on-prem</h2><p>Though there are significant advantages to on-prem deployments, they've come at a significant cost in the past, hence the shift to SaaS in many applications. Let's review some of the challenges of on-prem deployments, pre-Kubernetes.</p><h3>🔴 Heterogeneous customer environments create higher technical complexity</h3><p>When customer environments vary significantly, multiple parallel code paths must be built out for flows such as deployment, scale-up, updates, and error management. For example, binaries must be created for many different operating systems and environments. Additionally, there might be different network policies in a cluster, different resource amounts, and different endpoints/addresses for each of the nodes.</p><h3>🔴 Limited vendor visibility into bugs, crashes, and other problems</h3><p>In a SaaS offering, the vendor has easy access to logs, errors, crashes, etc, since they control the system. In a customer environment that vendor may have no idea that a problem is occuring in the first place. Usually, the customer must discover the problem for themselves and manually restart the system.</p><h3>🔴 Vendor does not control deployed version</h3><p>Many on-prem customers resist updating because "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Since updating is usually controlled by the customer, vendors need to support a large number of versions of their product at any given time. In contrast, with SaaS, the vendor can control the running version to a small number of versions, or even a single version</p><h3>🔴 Orchestration and self-healing logic must be built out</h3><p>It's one thing to build a set of binaries for your application for each target OS that you want to support. It's another task altogether to deploy those binaries to many different customer nodes, and support new nodes coming online, old nodes disappearing, and fault tolerance in the case that the application encounters an error. Investing in this logic can eat up a large amount of the development budget, away from features, bug fixes, and other higher priority items.</p><h3>🔴 Resource utilization of product must be carefully managed</h3><p>Resource-intensive applications that need a lot of CPU or memory can impose a significant burden on their host system. Many of us have seen supposedly "lightweight" agents using 50% of CPU or memory on our production clusters, so resource utilization must be carefully managed, especially in sensitive environments.</p><p>Kubernetes provides a powerful and rich set of abstractions across highly diverse customer environments. As a result, it is now significantly easier for developers to deploy their products on-prem directly on a customer Kubernetes cluster. Thanks to the high adoption of Kubernetes, this is a very large section of the market, which is likely to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Let's dive into how Kubernetes mitigates some of the above "cons" when deploying software on-prem to a customer.</p><h2>Deployment and Orchestration</h2><h3>Containerization</h3><p>Kubernetes allows the user to create a single binary packaged inside a container. This container can be run on a variety of operating systems or environments. This benefit is offered by any container-based system, but it's still worth noting.</p><h3>Orchestration and self-healing</h3><p>Previously, the vendor would build logic to deploy their product to every relevant customer node in the system. This would involve scaling up the deployment when nodes came online or went away.</p><p>Kubernetes provides a declarative, config-based solution for any system to do the following:</p><ul><li>Deploy to every node</li><li>Deploy to specific nodes</li><li>Update deployments when new nodes come online or go away</li></ul><p>Rather than building out the complex logic to perform these tasks, the vendor only needs to create a YAML or JSON config. This is a win for the customer too, who only needs to apply that config file to their cluster.</p><p>Kubernetes also comes with self-healing and scaling logic, built in to configs as well.</p><ul><li>Crash handling</li><li>Restarts</li><li>Autoscaling of services based on load</li></ul><p>While it was certainly possible to build out support for all of these cases in the past, it would be a significant investment. Reducing it to a system-agnostic YAML/JSON config file greatly reduces the barrier to building scalable, fault-tolerant on-prem products. Previously, supporting all of the above wouldn't just be done one time, but many times depending on the operating …</p></div></div></div></div>

February 24, 2021 | https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/expectations-and-reality/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/expectations-and-reality/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A while back, I created <a href="https://community.netlify.com/t/support-for-deno-on-netlify/14172">a thread in the Netilfy community forums about support for deno</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been monitoring activity on the thread from my inbox. The conversation has gone back and forth on feasibility and possible support. Ideas for a workaround have surfaced, but I’m keen on official support only (I’m trying to limit “workarounds” in my digital life).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://community.netlify.com/t/support-for-deno-on-netlify/14172/17">this message from Chris McCraw</a>, Director of Support at Netlify, came into my inbox:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No reason we couldn’t [support deno], but we haven’t...</p>
<p>Our already-pretty flexible CI env of “do whatever you want in the unix shell” is already a pretty huge thing to provide tech support on (leads to around 2/5 of our Support contacts, almost all about things that the customer has misconfigured rather than bugs in our system), and allowing people to bring their own docker image complicates things further. I suppose we could implement a “0 tech support” policy on custom containers to ease the operational cost, but while we can say anything we want - people can and do set their own expectations and expect more than that, judging from a decade in the industry, and in the gap between expectations and reality lies much sadness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, it’s fascinating to see Chris cite a number like that on the fly—“2/5 of our Support contacts”. These folks are clearly being intentional about measuring interdependent aspects of their business in order to understand cause and effect. The fact that he knows that number enough to recite it off-the-cuff in a forum post signals a lot to me about how Netlify builds product.</p>
<p>However, that’s not what impressed me the most about Chris’ comment. What impressed me was this insight, which I quote again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suppose we could implement a “0 tech support” policy on custom containers to ease the operational cost, but while we can say anything we want - people can and do set their own expectations and expect more than that...and in the gap between expectations and reality lies much sadness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giving people what they want sounds like a good idea, especially if the cost to you is negligible under your specified terms—”yeah we don’t really want to support that, but it wouldn’t cost us that much to just give it to you under the condition that you don’t ask us for help.”</p>
<p>However, Chris’ quote resonates from experience. The reality is you can say what you want, but people’s expectations are out of your hands. Once you put something into the world, it no longer belongs solely to you. You can’t say, “sure, here it is, but I’m not responsible for it.” Once it’s out, it takes on a life of its own and you no longer control its narrative or perception. Perception becomes reality and you may easily end up supporting something you explicitly stated you would not—often to preserve image, change perception, and/or improve customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>In summary: choose what you provide wisely because if you provide it with the caveat that you won’t support it, you may soon find yourself supporting it.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we share empirical measurements from our experiments in using Postgres to index and search over 10,000 top GitHub repositories using <code>pg_trgm</code> on only a Macbook.</p>

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/postgres-trigram-search-learnings">“Postgres Trigram search learnings”</a>, in which we shared several learnings and beliefs about trying to use Postgres Trigram indexes as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”).</p>

<p>We share our results, as well as <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements">the exact steps we performed, scripts, and lists of the top 20,000 repositories by stars/language on GitHub</a> so you can reproduce the results yourself should you desire.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p><strong>This article is extensive and more akin to a research paper than a blog post.</strong> If you’re interested in our conclusions, see <a href="#conclusions">conclusions</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>We wanted to get empirical measurements for how suitable Postgres is in providing regexp search over documents, e.g. as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”). In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many repositories can we index on just a 2019 Macbook Pro?</li>
  <li>How fast are different regexp searches over the corpus?</li>
  <li>What Postgres 13 configuration gives best results?</li>
  <li>What other operational effects need consideration if seriously attempting to use Postgres as the backend for a regexp search engine?</li>
  <li>What is the best database schema to use?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>We ran all tests on a 2019 Macbook Pro with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9</li>
  <li>16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4</li>
</ul>

<p>During test execution, few other Mac applications were in use such that effectively all CPU/memory was available to Postgres.</p>

<h2 id="corpus">Corpus</h2>

<p>We scraped <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/tree/main/top_repos">lists of the top 1,000 repositories from the GitHub search API</a> ranked by stars for each of the following languages (~20.5k repositories in total):</p>

<ul>
  <li>C++, C#, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, JavaScript, MatLab, ObjC, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Shell, Solidity, Swift, TypeScript, VB .NET, and Zig.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloning all ~20.5k repositories in parallel took ~14 hours with a fast ~100 Mbps connection to GitHub’s servers.</p>

<h3 id="dataset-reduction">Dataset reduction</h3>

<p>We found the amount of disk space required by <code>git clone --depth 1</code> on these repositories to be a sizable ~412G for just 12,148 repositories - and so we put in place several processes for further reduce the dataset size by about 66%:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removing <code>.git</code> directories resulted in a 30% reduction (412G -&gt; 290G, for 12,148 repositories)</li>
  <li>Removing files &gt; 1 MiB resulted in another 51% reduction (290G -&gt; 142G, for 12,148 repositories - note GitHub does not index files &gt; 384 KiB in their search engine)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="database-insertion">Database insertion</h2>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/cmd/corpusindex/main.go">concurrently inserted</a> the entire corpus into Postgres, with the following DB schema:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>pg_trgm</span><span>;</span>

    <span>filepath</span> <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In total, this took around ~8 hours to complete and Postgres’s entire on-disk utilization was 101G.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-trigram-index">Creating the Trigram index</h2>

<p>We tried three separate times to index the dataset using the following GIN Trigram index:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS files_contents_trgm_idx ON files USING GIN (contents gin_trgm_ops);
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In the first attempt, we hit an OOM after 11 hours and 34 minutes.</strong> This was due to a rapid spike in memory usage at the very end of indexing. We used a <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements#configuration-attempt-1-indexing-failure-oom">fairly aggressive</a> Postgres configuration with a very large max WAL size, so it was not entirely unexpected.</li>
  <li><strong>In the second attempt, we ran out of SSD disk space after ~27 hours</strong>. Notable is that the disk space largely grew towards the end of indexing, similar to when we faced an OOM - it was not a gradual increase over time. For this attempt, we used the excellent <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/#/">pgtune</a> tool to reduce our first Postgres configuration as follows:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>shared_buffers = 4GB → 2560MB
effective_cache_size = 12GB → 7680MB
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB → 1280MB
default_statistics_target = 100 → 500
work_mem = 5242kB → 16MB
min_wal_size = 50GB → 4GB
max_wal_size = 4GB → 16GB
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 8 → 4
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8 → 4
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In our third and final attempt, we cut the dataset in half and indexing succeeded after 22 hours.</strong> In specific, we deleted half of the files in the database (from 19,441,820 files / 178GiB of data to 9,720,910 files / 82 GiB of data.) The Postgres configuration used was the same as in attempt 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-memory-usage">Indexing performance: Memory usage</h2>

<p>In our first attempt, we see the reported <code>docker stats</code> memory usage of the container grow up to 12 GiB (chart shows MiB of memory used over time):</p>

<p><img width="981" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313722-56bbac80-6a50-11eb-94c7-8e13ea095053.png"></p>

<p>In our second and third attempts, we see far less memory usage (~1.6 GiB consistently):</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314104-350ef500-6a51-11eb-909f-2f1b524d29b2.png"></p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315387-ce3f0b00-6a53-11eb-886c-410f000f73bd.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-cpu-usage">Indexing performance: CPU usage</h2>

<p>Postgres’ Trigram indexing appears to be mostly single-threaded (at least when indexing <em>a single table</em>, we test multiple tables later.)</p>

<p>In our first attempt, CPU usage for the container did not rise above 156% (one and a half virtual CPU cores):</p>

<p><img width="982" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313915-cc277d00-6a50-11eb-9282-62159a127966.png"></p>

<p>Our second attempt was around 150-200% CPU usage on average:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314168-507a0000-6a51-11eb-8a18-ec18752f7f16.png"></p>

<p>Our third attempt similarly saw an average of 150-200%, but with a brief spike towards the end to ~350% CPU:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315239-8324f800-6a53-11eb-9a5b-fcc61d1a7b59.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-io">Indexing performance: Disk IO</h2>

<p>Disk reads/writes during indexing averaged about ~250 MB/s for reads (blue) and writes (red). Native in-software tests show the same Macbook able to achieve read/write speeds of ~860 MB/s with &lt;5% affect on CPU utilization.</p>

<p><small>Addition made Feb 20, 2021:</small> We ran tests using native Postgres as well (instead of in Docker with a bind mount) and found better indexing and query performance, more on this below.</p>

<p><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106507903-ec6f9e80-6488-11eb-88a8-78e5b7aacfd6.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-space">Indexing performance: Disk space</h2>

<p>The database contains 9,720,910 files totalling 82.07 GiB:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# select count(filepath) from files;
  count  
---------
 9720910
(1 row)

postgres=# select SUM(octet_length(contents)) from files;
     sum     
-------------
 88123563320
(1 row)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Before indexing</strong>, we find that all of Postgres is consuming 54G:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 54G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After <code>CREATE INDEX</code>, Postgres uses:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 73G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, the index size for 82 GiB of text is 19 GiB (or 23% of the data size.)</p>

<h2 id="database-startup-times">Database startup times</h2>

<p>From an operational standpoint, it is worth noting that if Postgres is starting clean (i.e. previous shutdown was graceful) then startup time is almost instantaneous: it begins accepting connections immediately and loads the index as needed.</p>

<p>However, if Postgres experienced a non-graceful termination during e.g. startup, it can take a hefty ~10 minutes with this dataset to start as it goes through an automated recovery process.</p>

<h2 id="queries-executed">Queries executed</h2>

<p>In total, we executed 19,936 search queries against the index. We chose queries which we expect give reasonably varying amounts of coverage over the trigram index (that is, queries whose trigrams are more or less likely to occur in many files):</p>

<h2 id="query-performance-vs-planning-time">Query performance vs. planning time</h2>

<p>The following scatter plot shows how 79% of queries executed in under 3s (Y axis, in ms), while Postgres’s query planner had planned them for execution in under 100-250ms generally (X axis, in ms):</p>

<p><img width="1252" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848471-ef379100-6db0-11eb-8396-4d156a179aae.png"></p>

<p>If we expand the view to include all queries, we start to get a picture of just how outlier these 21% of queries are (note that the small block of dots in the bottom left represents the same diagram shown above):</p>

<p><img width="1250" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848517-3cb3fe00-6db1-11eb-9652-e65d7d88fe36.png"></p>

<h2 id="query-time-vs-cpu--memory-usage">Query time vs. CPU &amp; Memory usage</h2>

<p>The following image shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(top) Query time in milliseconds</li>
  <li>(middle) CPU usage percentage (e.g. 801% refers to 8 out of 16 virtual CPU cores being consumed)</li>
  <li>(bottom) Memory usage in MiB.</li>
</ul>

<p><img width="1255" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848716-efd12700-6db2-11eb-8e8b-a8141a6bdb0b.png"></p>

<p>Notable insights from this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The large increase in resource usage towards the end is when we began executing queries with no <code>LIMIT</code>.</li>
  <li>CPU usage does not exceed 138%, until the spike at the end.</li>
  <li>Memory usage does not exceed 42 MiB, until the spike at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>We suspect <code>pg_trgm</code> is single-threaded within the scope of a single table, but with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/ddl-partitioning.html">table data partitioning</a> (or splitting data into multiple tables with subsets of the data), we suspect better parallelism could be achieved.</p>

<h2 id="investigating-slow-queries">Investigating slow queries</h2>

<p>If we plot the number of index rechecks (X axis) vs. execution time (Y axis), we can clearly see one of the most significant aspects of slow queries is that they have many more index rechecks:</p>

<p><img width="1036" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107849660-fc0cb280-6db9-11eb-9c10-cb7e74366ab7.png"></p>

<p>And if we look at <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/query_logs/query-run-3.log#L3-L24">the <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> output for one of these queries</a> we can also confirm <code>Parallel Bitmap Heap Scan</code> is slow due to <code>Rows Removed by Index Recheck</code>.</p>

<h2 id="table-splitting">Table splitting</h2>

<p>Splitting up the search index into multiple smaller tables seems like an obvious approach to getting <code>pg_trgm</code> to use multiple CPU cores. We tried this by taking the same exact data set and splitting it into 200 tables, and found …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Two MPs&nbsp;formally abstained.</p>  <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and almost all of his cabinet colleagues were absent for the vote.&nbsp;Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau&nbsp;was the only cabinet minister present. When it was his turn, he said he abstained "on behalf of the Government of Canada."&nbsp;</p>  <p>The motion also calls on the government to lobby the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympic Games out of Beijing.</p>  <p>It was passed over the strenuous objections of&nbsp;Chinese Ambassador to Canada&nbsp;Cong Peiwu, who denounced the vote as&nbsp;meddling in China's internal affairs.</p>    <p>China also condemned&nbsp;the motion. At a briefing in Beijing Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China has lodged stern representations with Canada.</p>  <p>After the vote,&nbsp;Garneau issued a statement saying the federal government remains "deeply disturbed by horrific reports of human rights violations in&nbsp;Xinjiang,&nbsp;including the use of arbitrary detention, political re-education, forced labour, torture and forced sterilization.</p>  <p>"The government of Canada will continue to work with international partners to defend vulnerable minorities and we once again repeat our call for transparency and a credible international investigation in response to allegations of genocide.</p>  <p>"This investigation must be conducted by an international and independent body so that impartial experts can observe and report on the situation first-hand."</p>  <h2>'Stop spreading disinformation,' says China</h2>  <p>Media reports and academic and UN experts have accused China of imprisoning Uighurs in concentration and "deradicalization" camps and targeting them for&nbsp;forced labour, sexual violence, population control methods and sweeping surveillance. China's foreign ministry has denied the accusations.</p>  <p>The motion calls on the government to officially adopt the position that China is engaged in genocide, and to coordinate a response with the U.S. and other allies.</p>  <p>While it's not&nbsp;clear what impact —&nbsp;if any —&nbsp;the non-binding resolution will have on the Liberal government's approach to China, it threatens to inflame relations between the two countries at a time when they're already tense due to the arrest of Huawei&nbsp;chief financial officer&nbsp;Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities more than&nbsp;two years ago, and China's subsequent imprisonment of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.</p>  <p>In a statement posted to the Chinese embassy's website prior to the vote, Cong insisted the reports of Uighur persecution&nbsp;are based on lies.</p>  <p>"A few people in Canada and some other western countries are talking about upholding values, but one important part of the values should be: respect facts and stop spreading disinformation and even lies," Cong said in the statement.</p>  <p>"We urge the Canadian side to take seriously China's solemn position … so as not to cause further damages to China-Canada relations."</p>  <h2>'A time for moral clarity'</h2>  <p>At a press conference this morning, Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said the evidence of China's crimes is overwhelming. He cited survivor testimony, satellite images, video, documents and media reports from major U.S. and international news outlets.</p>  <p>"Today is a time for moral clarity," said Chong. "We can no longer ignore this. We must call it for what it is — a genocide."</p>  <p>Chong and Conservative human rights critic Garnett Genuis were joined at the event by a Uighur woman who fled China and has become an outspoken critic of the Chinese regime.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Conservatives call on all MPs to support Uighur genocide motion:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Conservatives call on all MPs to support Uighur genocide motion" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1864402499707-metadata-" title="Conservatives call on all MPs to support Uighur genocide motion"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/369/799/UIGH_7000kbps_1280x720_1864404035954.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>The House of Commons will vote on whether to formally declare China's treatment of the Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims as a genocide.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:21</span></span></span></p>  <p>Speaking through a translator, Kalbinur Tursun said she was assigned to teach Chinese at a mass detention facility and a women's prison in the city of Ürümqi from March to November 2017.</p>  <p>She said that during her time in the job, she saw or heard of multiple acts of intimidation, violence and rape directed against Uighur people.</p>  <p>"No one should be subjected to such cruelty," she said.</p>  <p>Tursun said she was forcibly sterilized in 2019 through a surgical procedure, along with hundreds of other Uighur women.</p>  <p>Tursun said some of her relatives are still in Chinese prisons and that Chinese authorities have targeted her for harassment and intimidation to punish her for speaking out.</p>  <h2>Canada wants independent investigation</h2>  <p>MPs on the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights agreed in an October report with the experts who say China's campaign against the Uighurs meets the definition of genocide set out by the UN. The committee heard testimony from several&nbsp;Uighur witnesses who gave first-hand accounts of atrocities</p>  <p>Bob Rae, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bob-rae-genocide-investigation-uighur-minority-1.5802920">called on the United Nations in November</a>&nbsp;to investigate whether China's persecution of ethnic Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang constitutes genocide.</p>  <p>Despite these calls, Prime Minister Trudeau and his cabinet ministers have been reluctant to use the word "genocide" to describe China's actions against the Uighurs. Last week, Trudeau said the word is an "extremely loaded" one&nbsp;and he is not prepared to use it at this point.</p>  <p><em><strong>Watch:&nbsp;MPs discuss what's next now that the House has declared China is committing a genocide:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="MPs discuss what's next now that the House has declared China is committing a genocide" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1864638019855-metadata-" title="MPs discuss what's next now that the House has declared China is committing a genocide"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/594/399/PP-PANEL-GENOCIDE.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>MPs- Rob Oliphant, Michael Chong and Jack Harris joined Power &amp; Politics Monday to discuss the House vote to declare that China is committing a genocide and what must happen next.<!-- --> <!-- -->8:44</span></span></span></p>  <p>In question period today, Garneau said the government takes allegations against China "very seriously" and has raised its concerns directly with the Chinese government.</p>  <p>Garneau said Canada wants independent investigators to go into China to document abuses and is working with international partners to gain access to the region.</p>  <p>A formal genocide declaration would bring Canada in line with the U.S. ahead of a virtual<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/biden-trudeau-tuesday-meeting-1.5921708"> <u>bilateral meeting between Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden</u></a> scheduled for Tuesday.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5915395.1613494147!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/china-olympics-beijing-boycott-letter.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5915395.1613494147!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/china-olympics-beijing-boycott-letter.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5915395.1613494147!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/china-olympics-beijing-boycott-letter.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5915395.1613494147!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-olympics-beijing-boycott-letter.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5915395.1613494147!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/china-olympics-beijing-boycott-letter.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5915395.1613494147!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-olympics-beijing-boycott-letter.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A man wearing a face mask to protect against the coronavirus walks past the Olympic rings on the exterior of the National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, which will be a venue for the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics, in Beijing, Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2021.

The problem was that each time they had an idea for a new recommendation based on a metric already in the database (like the 50% decrease in HRV), they’d have to ask Arun and Lucas to add it instead of doing it themselves. </p><p>Our DevOps team realized that as Point grows, it’d be essential for them to update and add content independently using a CMS. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Enter <a href="http://forestadmin.com/"><strong>Forest Admin</strong></a>. <br></p><h3 id="creating-new-content-seamlessly"><strong>Creating new content seamlessly &nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>We chose Forest Admin to create Point’s admin panel, where the Point team can now create new user-facing content at any time.

The Point team can write new content in the Forest Admin panel and connect it to the data and insights already stored in their servers. <br></li></ol><p><em>“We have a product offering that’s rooted in biometric health data, digital content, and data science, yet we’re an early-stage startup that also needs to experiment and iterate quickly.

The admin panel’s flexible, customizable features make it intuitive and straightforward to use. &nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>3. <strong><strong>Security: </strong></strong></strong>With both the CMS and database servers managed internally by our DevOps team, we can ensure that users’ personal health data remains secure. It doesn’t need to be sent around to third parties. <br></p><figure><img src="https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 600w, https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 1000w, https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 1600w, https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 2240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Forest Admin's simple API makes it easy to create &amp; update content</figcaption></figure><p><em>“The UI/UX within Forest Admin allows us to iterate on copy and content while ensuring that if we have any changes, everyone on the team is empowered to do so.

<p>If you understand the underlying concept of recursion but struggle to implement it like myself, or you don't even know what it is, then this post if for you.</p>
<p>Recursion is defined as solving a complex problem by breaking the problem into smaller versions of itself that can be solved. In programming, this is done by having a function call itself.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of recursion are these two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case</strong>: this case defines the smallest instance of a problem. In certain recursive solutions, there can be multiple base cases but for the purpose of this post's explanation, my example will only incorporate one. When coding, the base case prevents an infinite loop of the function calling itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive Case</strong>: this case manipulates the problem in order to approach the base case. In programming, this is the case in which the function calls itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Put simply, the recursive case will breakdown the problem until it arrives at the base case, after which the the sub solutions build up to solve the original problem.</p>
<p>Do not worry if your understanding of recursion is hazy because the above definitions will make sense when implementing a recursive solution in Python.</p>
<h2 id="the-call-stack">The Call Stack</h2>
<p>In order to truly understand how recursion is implemented in Python, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the call stack. </p>
<p>The call stack uses the stack data structure to keep track of local variables and previous function calls. The stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. This means that the last item to be placed in the stack will be the first to be removed. To help visualize, think of a stack of plates:</p>

<p>Whatever plate is placed last on the stack is the first one to be removed.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, the stack has two simple operations: push and pop. Push adds an item onto the stack and pop removes an item from the stack, returning its value.</p>
<p>In python, the call stack consists of frames. The bottom most frame is the global or module frame. This consists of all the global variables. Every time a function is called a new frame is pushed onto the stack containing its local variables and function arguments. When a function call returns, the frame is popped off the stack and its value is passed to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<h2 id="a-famous-recursion-example-factorial">A Famous Recursion Example - Factorial</h2>
<p>The factorial of a number is defined as so:</p>
<p>4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</p>
<p>If we were to define the factorial of a number <code>n</code> as a mathematical equation, it would be:</p>
<p><code>factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)</code></p>
<p>The right side of the equation will be the <em>recursive case</em> of our solution. Notice, how the recursive case takes the original problem,<code>factorial(n)</code>, and makes it a simpler problem of multiplying <code>n</code> by whatever <code>factorial(n-1)</code> is.</p>
<p>We can define a function <code>factorial</code> that takes a parameter <code>n</code>. However, if we only defined this function with the above equation, it would call itself infinitely leading to an error.</p>
<p>This is because we did not define a <em>base case</em>. The most basic factorial is the factorial of 1 which equals 1. So we can tell the program that once it reaches the factorial of 1, instead of calling <code>1 * factorial(0)</code>, to just <code>return 1</code>. After which, the Python call stack will handle multiplying out the numbers.</p>
<p>After defining both the recursive and base cases, we arrive at the Python program below:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> n &lt;= <span>1</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>else</span>:
        <span>return</span> n * factorial(n<span>-1</span>)
</code></pre><h2 id="in-depth-recursive-function-implementation">In Depth Recursive Function Implementation</h2>
<p>Before calling the factorial function, the Python call stack would look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222009642/RKv1SGozi.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 1 (3).png"></p>
<p>Then, we call the factorial function passing in an argument of 4. </p>
<pre><code><span>factorial</span>(<span>4</span>)
</code></pre><p>A frame for the factorial function would be pushed onto to the call stack, setting the argument <code>n</code> equal to <code>4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222128046/cNmno7-YI.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 2.png"></p>
<p>The Python interpreter will then process the function and since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, it will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. However before the function can return a value, it must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code>. This will cause another factorial frame to be pushed on the stack, with the argument <code>n</code> set to <code>3</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222294743/zXgfi23TF.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 3.png"></p>
<p>Again, since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, the function will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. Likewise, the function must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code> before returning a value. </p>
<p>This pattern will continue until the factorial frame with the argument n equal to 1 is pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222730246/6jJduzt8q.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 5 (1).png"></p>
<p>When this occurs, the function reaches the base case, so it instead returns 1. As I mentioned early when explaining the call stack, when a function returns, it pops its frame off the stack, transferring its value to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222867866/Npx8dueYc.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 6.png"></p>
<p>Now since the value for <code>factorial(n-1)</code> has been evaluated, the factorial function can evaluate the product and return it to the previous frame, pushing the current frame off the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222963799/kJ7D_a-7I.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 7.png"></p>
<p>This pattern continues until we reach the original function call...</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612223032269/rxZsqVaa8.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 8.png"></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the factorial function with argument 4 returns a value of 24.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When writing a recursive solution in Python, think of the problem in terms of a base case and recursive case. Ask yourself: "How can I define a recursive case that will help me reduce the problem towards a base case?"</p>
<p>When trying to understand a recursive solution, I find it best to visualize the call stack in my head.  Every time a function is called an item is added onto the stack and any time you encounter the return keyword, it pops an item off the stack and returns its value to the previous function call.</p>

February 24, 2021 | https://amycastor.com/2021/02/23/ny-ag-tether-bitfinex-settlement-reveals-commingling-of-funds-years-of-shenanigans/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amycastor.com/2021/02/23/ny-ag-tether-bitfinex-settlement-reveals-commingling-of-funds-years-of-shenanigans/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-6264">
		<div>
		
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/02/23/tether-bitfinex-to-pay-18-5m-to-nyag-cease-trading-in-new-york/">quick article</a> this morning about the New York attorney general settlement, wherein Bitfinex and Tether agreed to pay $18.5 million in penalties, stop servicing New York customers, and submit quarterly transparency reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are more details to highlight. Namely, the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf">settlement agreement</a> reveals the games Bitfinex and Tether have played over the years—games they will keep on playing until someone puts an end to their shenanigans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also reveals how the firms have long misled the public about Tether’s reserves. From 2014 until late February 2019, Tether advertised that tethers were fully backed 1:1 by cash in some bank accounts somewhere—but that was not true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tether now has 34 billion tethers in circulation—a number that is growing by leaps and bounds every day. </p>



<p>Here are my random thoughts and notes from the 17-page agreement. </p>



<h2>Phil Potter</h2>



<p>In the agreement, the office of the NY attorney general writes: “During the time period relevant to the OAG’s investigation, and as late as early-to-mid 2018, one of Bitfinex and Tether’s senior executives lived in, and conducted his work from, New York.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m assuming this is Phil Potter, Bitfinex and Tether’s chief strategy officer, and one of its three top execs. Potter allegedly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/chief-strategy-officer-of-bitfinex-and-tether-resigns/">stepped away</a> from the company in mid-2018, about the time the NY attorney general started its investigation. Though the public did not learn of the investigation until <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/04/26/new-york-attorney-general-bitfinex-is-hiding-850-million-in-losses/">April 2019.</a></p>



<p>The fact that Bitfinex and Tether had one executive and large customers in the state—and no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLicense">BitLicense</a>—opened the door to the NY attorney general’s probe. Per the terms of the settlement, Bitfinex and Tether can no longer do any business in the state, which means New York crypto firms can no longer use tethers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, although Bitfinex and Tether claim to have barred New York residents (retail investors) in January 2017, they still served <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eligible_contract_participant.asp">eligible contract participants,</a> meaning individuals or trading firms with assets in the millions. </p>



<h2>Commingled funds</h2>



<p>Tether and Bitfinex lost their banking in March 2017 when they were cut off by Wells Fargo, a correspondent bank. Subsequently, their banks in Taiwan also dumped them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months later, when Tether had 108 million tethers in circulation, Bitfinex opened an account at Noble Bank in Puerto Rico. (Noble Bank, by the way, was co-founded by Brock Pierce, the child star who also created Tether.)</p>



<p>Tether, however, did not open an account at Noble—or at any bank—until September 2017, according to the office of the NY attorney general’s findings.  </p>



<p>Instead, Tether deposited the “vast majority” of its cash into a trust account held by its general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, at the Bank of Montreal in Canada. The account never held more than $61.5 million dollars. </p>



<p>The rest of Tether’s money was mixed in with Bitfinex customer money at Bitfinex accounts at Noble Bank. Between June 1 and September 2017—Bitfinex held hundreds of millions of dollars in Tether’s funds in its accounts, the prosecutor said. </p>



<p>Commingling of funds is a terrible idea—legally and logistically. (Failed crypto exchange QuadrigaCX also commingled funds. And its now-allegedly-deceased CEO used customer money like his own personal slush fund.)&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Mystery NY trading firm</h2>



<p>Because Tether had no bank account between March and September 2017, it could not directly take money for tethers. At the same time, according to the NY attorney general, “neither the Tether website or Bitfinex allowed for the direct purchase or exchange of tethers in exchange for any other virtual currency, including the two most popular virtual currencies, bitcoin and ether.”  </p>



<p>Between June and September 2017, “Bitfinex’s Noble Bank account received USD deposits from only two institutional trading firms, one of which was located in New York. Neither of those firms purchased tethers directly from Bitfinex or Tether during this time period.”</p>



<p>This part of the NY attorney general’s findings puzzles. Why were these trading firms sending money to Bitfinex if they were not getting tethers in exchange? What were they getting instead?&nbsp;And who was the New York firm?</p>



<p>Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is based in New York. And we know it was onboarding as a Bitfinex customer in October 2018, based on court documents that point to <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=neWR7TrbmgYhmz/mrk7drA==">letters</a> Galaxy sent to Bitfinex. But it is not clear if Galaxy was a customer of Bitfinex or Tether in 2017. (In April 2019, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190709094915if_/https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1121761199547457536">Novogratz claimed</a> Galaxy had “zero exposure” to Bitfinex and Tether.)</p>



<h2>Staging the Friedman audit</h2>



<p>According to the office of the NY attorney general, until September 15, 2017, the only U.S. dollars held by Tether backing 442 million tethers in circulation was $61 million at the Bank of Montreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever other money Tether had was held in Bitfinex accounts. </p>



<p>In the summer of 2017, rumors were afoot that tethers were not fully backed. To quash those rumors, Tether and Bitfinex arranged for accounting firm Friedman LLP to perform an <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf">attestation</a> on September 15, 2017. </p>



<p>They had to move quickly to set things up though. </p>



<p>On that morning, Tether opened an account at Noble Bank. And Bitfinex transferred $382 million from Bitfinex’s account at Noble Bank into Tether’s account at Noble Bank. Friedman conducted its verification of Tether’s assets that evening. </p>



<p>“No one reviewing Tether’s representations would have reasonably understood that the $382,064,782 listed as cash reserves for tethers had only been placed in Tether’s account as of the very morning that Friedman verified the bank balance,” the NY attorney general wrote. The attestation included the money at the Bank of Montreal as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Friedman’s relationship with Bitfinex <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-confirms-relationship-auditor-dissolved">ended a few months later.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s never a good sign when your auditor quits. Worse, there was no official announcement—Friedman simply&nbsp;<a href="https://www.friedmanllp.com/search-results/#/?query=bitfinex">deleted all mention</a>&nbsp;of Bitfinex from its website, including past press releases.</p>



<h2>Massive loss of funds</h2>



<p>In 2017 and 2018, Bitfinex began to increasingly rely on Crypto Capital to handle its customer deposits and withdrawals. Oz Yosef, was Bitfinex’s contact at the Panamanian payment processor.</p>



<p>By 2018, Crypto Capital held over $1 billion of Bitfinex funds.&nbsp;That’s when the real trouble started.</p>



<p>In April 2018, the government of Poland froze a Crypto Capital bank account holding $340 million. Adding to that, Oz told Bitfinex that a Crypto Capital account in Portugal containing $150 million of Bitfinex client funds also had been frozen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These events threw Bitfinex into a liquidity crisis. And in the summer of 2018, Bitfinex began dipping into Tether’s cash reserves to fund customer withdrawals. Bitfinex told customers that rumors of its insolvency were false, but behind the scenes, the crypto exchange was pleading with Oz to release the money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Later we learn that another $350 million in missing Crypto Capital funds were linked to <a href="https://decrypt.co/40020/suspect-in-bitfinex-case-held-accounts-at-a-dozen-of-the-worlds-top-banks">60 accounts</a> held by Arizona businessman Reginald Fowler, who was indicted in April 2019 for bank fraud. Some of these accounts were frozen in 2018. Oz’s sister, Ravid Yosef, was also indicted for her role in assisting Fowler set up those accounts. She is still at large.) </p>



<p>(And in October 2019, Crypto Capital President Molina Lee was <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/44591/ceo-of-crypto-capital-arrested-in-alleged-money-laundering-operation">arrested by Polish authorities</a> in connection with laundering money for Columbian drug cartels via Bitfinex.)</p>



<h2>Deltec Bank &amp; Trust</h2>



<p>In October 2018, Bitfinex and Tether ended their relationship with Noble bank. Soon after, they announced they were banking with Deltec in the Bahamas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tether-Letter.pdf">letter</a> dated Nov. 1, 2018, Deltec said Tether’s account held $1.8 billion, enough to back the tethers in circulation at the time. The letter was signed but had no name under the signature.&nbsp;The signature itself was illegible. </p>



<p>The following day, Tether began moving hundreds of millions of dollars out of its bank account at Deltec to Bitfinex’s bank account at Deltec. And as part of a “loan arrangement,” between the two closely related firms, Tether assumed Bitfinex’s losses on its own balance sheet. (We can’t be sure of the total loan amount, but an estimate is $750 million.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tether’s misrepresentation that tethers were fully backed continued to Feb. 2019 when it updated its <a href="https://tether.to/legal/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=7668a26d4d01f6c71aa2a4e2386841f2e201f35b-1610342909-0-AY_w4JoCzqaSyoOGw55agsM3ipnbJEMQqOZXufVTDhfHyDJgPtqJMrB15TqMqiVpiH4fi3cHl8TF038Xyhhx-IrJzDFGLw0KEdRAkQIFlwbDu4u8pXptiipGJ6EU4g5fZ-WV_HpN5AqYabrPiCmsz1B5m4BG4fXUt3aibkmFaxtvodop17vaeJ3QjQ3szVNn6AbuPHV02Rxjjan_wMUoCwiNvehow9kb1BvElZjTD8t44E7C-oRdICUfQZ_Mc0RZ1Q-D9Thlmz3DmF6-fs07YB8nmVP_BVvqy3ko5OVQ_Mz4CV1THXyqhq5R8jf41iBg7Q">terms of service</a>&nbsp;to say that tethers are backed by “traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.”</p>



<p>Bitfinex says it <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/600">paid off the loan</a> to Tether in January, and <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/01/10/tethers-paolo-ardoino-stuart-hoegner-do-a-podcast-transcript-and-comments/">the firms now claim tethers are fully backed</a>—but the question is, backed by what? Loans? Bitcoins? We’ll find out in 90 days when Tether and Bitfinex publish their first transparency report. Per the terms of the settlement agreement, the firms will need to publish these reports quarterly for two years. </p>



<p>Also, $18.5 million—the amount of the settlement—is no small number.&nbsp;We have no idea how much cash Tether and Bitfinex actually have on hand. </p>



<p>The bitcoin community is calling the settlement a win for Tether and Bitfinex. They say the fine is nothing but a slap on the wrist. In reality, it’s another way for Tether and Bitfinex to buy time. The NY attorney general has set its trap; now we wait.</p>



<p><em>Updated Feb. 24 to note that Novogratz claimed zero exposure to Bitfinex and Tether in 2019. </em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I started developing web services (JSON APIs) in Rust a little bit more than 2 years ago, so I thought it was time to shake the preconceived ideas and share what I’ve learned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m writing a book  (available in early access) about Rust where I share everything I’ve learned and more. Here is a <a href="https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG">coupon to save 10€ on the book</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-prejudices">The prejudices</h2>
<p><strong>Rust code is ugly</strong>: Rust is explicit. Undeniably. But when I write code, my IDE helps me a lot, and I don’t have to press that many keys. When I read code, this explicitness is just awesome! No hidden surprises, no weird things.</p>
<p><strong>Memory management is a distraction</strong>: Actually, no. I don’t use that many lexical lifetimes and use instead smart pointers. So yes, I have to understand the differences between an <code>Rc</code> and an <code>Arc</code>, but my productivity is not impacted compared to Node.JS or Go.</p>
<p><strong>Compiler is a pain in the a</strong>**: At the beginning, yes. But after a few months, I was able to understand all the errors instantly and fix them in a blink. Today I really don’t spend much time fighting with the compiler. Instead, it became my best friend, especially when refactoring large portions of code or upgrading dependencies :)</p>
<p><strong>Slow compile times</strong>: I accord you this one. When in Node.JS or Go a medium-sized service’s Docker image takes 3 to 10 mins to build and deploy, in Rust it will be about 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>The ecosystem is not there</strong>: Yet. Yes, some pieces are missing, such as official Stripe and AWS SDKs, but the community is really active and built all these missing pieces.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-things-i-particularly-appreciate">A few things I particularly appreciate</h2>
<p><strong>Static linking is remarkably easy</strong>: Creating <a href="https://github.com/skerkour/bloom/blob/main/Dockerfile">small Docker images</a> is a delight.</p>
<p><strong>Rust will make you a better programmer</strong>: Rust is complicated and won’t leave you alone if you don’t understand how it works in detail. It takes time and patience to master, but once you do, you’ll have learned so many things that you’ll never approach programming as before. I understood how Go’s runtime works while learning how <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">tokio</a> works.</p>
<p><strong>Once it compiles, it works</strong> (usually): This is my favorite thing about Rust. When my program compiles, it works as I planned. Just remember not to block the event loop, and the compiler will take care of the rest. You no longer have to spend time writing tests for the quirks of the language.</p>
<p><strong>Rust is productive</strong>: Because Rust is multi-paradigm, it really shines when writing complex business logic, thanks to its functional aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Crates I use</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web">actix-web</a> for the HTTP layer.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">sqlx</a> for the database (PostgreSQL).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto">rusoto</a> to interface with AWS services for storage (S3), background jobs (SQS) and sending emails (SES).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera">tera</a> for email templates.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror">thiserror</a> for my error types.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust">sentry</a> for error monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rust is a real pleasure to use for web development, and I thoroughly recommend to give it a try.</p>
<!-- It is so versatile that, without a doubt, it's the last programming language I learn. Ever. -->
<p>It’s a <ins>loooong</ins> journey to become effective, but totally worth it, and even if you don’t use it every day, you’ll for sure become a better programmer by learning it and, if lost, rediscover the joy of programming 🤗</p>
<p>In a word: Rust brings calm. No more bad surprises at 3 A.M. No more bugs because a dependency updated its API. No more annoying configuration for auto-scaling or whatever. And welcome response times so small that your users will fall in love with your product.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more from real-world Rust experience, I’m writing a book (available in early access) where, among other things, we will create and deploy HTTP services in Rust.

                        <blockquote>"Young men should prove theorems, old men should write books."</blockquote>
                        <p>- G.H. Hardy</p>
                        <h4>Why I wrote a book?</h4>
                        <p>During my graduate studies, I have been enthralled with how books often stay relevant and how quickly papers sink into obscurity. I wanted to write something that had value and durability. Why a book? Because books can last. </p>
                        <p>I am not old, but I wanted to take a break from theorem proving to write something light-hearted and decidedly non-academic.</p>
                        <h4>Why this book?</h4>
                        <p>My background is in mathematics, theoretical computer science, and machine learning. However, I got started down this path because of my love for data. Data can tell some pretty incredible stories, but it also can be extremely misleading. There are scores of introductory books about data science that start with Aggregation and finish with $z \sim N(0,1)$. They are designed for a technical audience and are often SO boring.</p>
                        <p>Don't get me wrong, I love these books. I helped with the recently released 2nd edition of Kevin Murphy's famed Machine Learning a Probabilistic Perspective. But I wanted my book to be more inspiration and less perspiration.</p>
                        <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
                        <p>This book is for people as untechnical as my Mom or as technical as my Applied Scientist friends working in big tech. The book is a nice, fun, and inspirational collection of stories.</p>
                        <p>These stories about data should get you thinking about your own life. I hope you ask if there are ways you can collect interesting data and learn something about yourself.</p>
                        <h4>So what's in the book?</h4>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/toc.png"></p><p>It is 114 pages long with 8 chapters. The chapters cover a wide range of fun data topics like how to use language models (and word vectors) to improve your resume, or how a man used statistics to qualify for the Olympics. As a fun warm up, chapter 2 shows how to use A/B testing to make the perfect glass of lemonade.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/a:b_out_routing1.png"></p><p>It starts with naive A/B testing then moves to Thompson sampling as a solution to Multi-Armed Bandit problems which are significantly more efficient and only takes a few lines of extra code.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/a:b_bandit1.png"></p><p>Chapter 3 talks about how a man keeping track of his personal health markers detected colon cancer and was able to get life saving treatment just in time. It gives a good example of how to reason about yourself vs the popluation. </p>
                        <p>Further on I analyze our dog's potty habits, weight loss using differential equations, and how you can figure out who is carrying your phone just using on-board accelerometer data.</p>
                        <p>The book has fun illustrations and nice color coded explanations for equations</p>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/Odebirds.png"><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/cosine.png">
                        </p>
                        <p>I've gotten some nice feedback so far, with people saying things like "This is the book I wish I had written", or "I literally have 3 new ideas of how I'm going to use my daily data". Plus, my Mom liked it, so that has to count for something.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the day, I wrote this book to inspire and encourage people to be aware of their lives, be mindful of what is happening around them, and take control with the techniques often used in data science.</p>

                        <p>If any of this sounds interesting, you're welcome to buy a copy for yourself. I tried to make the PDF version affordable so it is accessible to everyone.</p>

                        <p>I used the Tufte-Book Latex template, Procreate on my iPad for figures, and Kindle Direct Publishing for the physical copy. </p>
                        <p>I paid a professional editor (but unfortunately there are still a few nice typos) and so far they have made the most from this project.</p>
                        <p>I want to thank my lovely colleagues who encouraged me and have supported me. And also, I want to thank my Wife for letting me spend 150 extra hours at my computer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>If there's anything we've learned since we <a href="https://www.twingate.com/blog/introducing-twingate">founded Twingate</a>, it's that companies jump through extraordinary hoops to grant, manage, and secure access to their networks. Whether it's whitelisting ever-changing IP addresses; maintaining complex subnet assignments and VLAN segments; or manually piecing together network events across hybrid networks, these heroic tasks all have something in common: making up for the shortcomings of TCP/IP.</p><p>Where open, trusted access made sense at the inception of computer networking almost 50 years ago, the exact opposite is true today. Trust can no longer be assumed based on being physically hardwired to a network, and devices may have multiple IP addresses and hop across many networks in a single day. New layers of authentication, anomaly detection, and monitoring are continually being added to every layer of the network stack, but these approaches do not address the foundational shortcomings.</p><p>Twingate turns this model on its head by rethinking these base assumptions around networking. Rather than attempting to filter every network session looking for anomalies or performing additional checks on every network connection that arrives at a destination, Twingate starts by asking a simple question: should a network request even be allowed to leave a device? And if so, whose identity should be attached to it?</p><p>Once you start to think about every connection on your network as <em>requiring</em> an identity that just <em>happens</em> to have a source IP address, it makes setting parameters and understanding network activity a lot easier. Because network connections are never allowed to enter your network without an identity attached to an explicit authorization, there is no longer any question of who a network connection belongs to and why it was authorized.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.twingate.com/customers/">customers</a> have been thrilled with the experience of throwing out their clunky VPN and replacing it with Twingate's new approach to managing network access, which we call <strong>Identity-First Networking</strong>. Today we're proud to announce the launch of this foundational approach with the following new product features and partnerships.</p><p><h3>Major identity provider support &amp; SCIM-based synchronization</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><blockquote><em>Twingate is pushing the boundaries of security and usability in the world of Zero Trust. They have created a product that starts with identity at the center. OneLogin is proud to partner with Twingate to bring Identity-First Network security to the most demanding and innovative companies in the world.<br>— Chelsea Wadsworth, Director of Global Alliances, OneLogin</em></blockquote><p>Modern organizations—with a myriad of applications used by a distributed workforce—depend on centralizing user identity to ease management and improve security. Given the benefits, user identity as a primitive has been applied across virtually every application that enterprises use today, but the network layer has been left behind.</p><p>Twingate enables the benefits of identity at the network transport level (any TCP or UDP connection), allowing our customers to unify both network and application access centrally. Now every resource on your network—including databases, servers, k8s clusters, etc.—that are typically very difficult (if not impossible!) to integrate with your identity provider natively can be managed in one place. If a user is not entitled to access a network destination, their traffic will never traverse your network.</p><p>User authentication is only part of the story. Equally important is ensuring that user lifecycle state and applicable group membership is synchronized promptly and accurately. Twingate supports SCIM for user and group synchronization, extending automatic onboarding and offboarding to every resource on your network. Twingate integrates with the major identity providers including Okta, OneLogin, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Azure AD.</p><p><h3>Universal Two-Factor Authentication</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><p>Today we're launching <strong>native two-factor authentication</strong> to our Business and Enterprise customers, which will allow more fine-grained controls independent of your chosen identity provider and independent of the destination. We call this experience <strong>Universal 2FA</strong> because it can be applied to any type of resource with zero application changes.</p><p>One of the "wow" moments for our customers is using Twingate's Universal 2FA to apply discretionary security levels to resources according to their sensitivity. For example, admins can ensure that users with production network SSH access are subject to an additional 2FA challenge. The lack of application changes, and flexibility to work with any protocol or resource, means that security changes can be made immediately. The user experience is also seamless, operating in-line with the user's workflow thanks to Twingate's transport-level network routing.</p><p><h3>Identity-indexed network flow logs and analytics</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><p>With every network connection authenticated against a central user identity and authorized by security policies defined in Twingate, for the first time ever, our customers now have an identity-first view of their private network flow. All private traffic is always directly associated with user identity, including the authorization rule that allowed the connection, network path information, data volume transferred, and port details.</p><p>Identity-indexed network analytics make it straightforward to not only determine who accessed internal resources, but to quickly identify usage patterns, trends, and spot anomalous behavior. For forensic investigations, gone are the days of piecing together time-stamped network logs and IP addresses from disparate systems to try to understand a sequence of events. Identity ties all access information together, regardless of location, device, operating system, or network.</p><p><h3>Secure your internet traffic with DNSFilter</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><blockquote><em>In 2020 we saw a huge increase in the number of online threats targeting companies who have transitioned to a remote work environment. Our partnership with Twingate allows these companies to, through the use of our products, have access to true end-to-end threat protection while connecting from anywhere on earth. We’re excited to partner with a Zero Trust solution like Twingate that provides an alternative to traditional VPNs. <br>— Ken Carnesi, CEO, DNSFilter</em></blockquote><p>Twingate secures your private network traffic, but we also recognize the risk that public internet access introduces to company devices, particularly as the prevalence of ransomware and phishing attacks has surged in our work-from-anywhere reality. Working from home, without the protection of a corporate firewall, has left devices more vulnerable. DNS filtering is a critical component in protecting employees from these threats.</p><p>Since our inception we've made it an explicit product goal to ensure that we "play nice" with other network security products. Our belief is that a combination of specialized products, with the companies behind them focused on solving their problem space in depth, presents the best possible outcome for customers.</p><p>As we've gotten to know the team at DNSFilter, they couldn't embody this spirit of focus in depth more fully, and we're excited to partner with them to offer a complete solution to protect employees. With DNSFilter’s AI-powered content filtering solution and multi-platform roaming client, admins can now deploy DNSFilter and Twingate side by side to fully protect both private and public user traffic, no matter where they are and what device they’re on.</p><p><h3>The most innovative companies are adopting Twingate</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><blockquote><em>From our company Zoom call after rolling out Twingate: <br>"Already changed my entire life. Run, don't walk, to Twingate!" <br>— Neal Harris, Director of Security, Persona</em></blockquote><p>Since we launched Twingate, we have been fortunate to partner with some of the most innovative, fastest-growing companies around the world. Most of <a href="https://www.twingate.com/customers">our customers</a> are facing similar challenges—juggling efforts to rapidly scale their teams while dealing with the realities and limitations of remote work using outdated technology.</p><p>Most notably, our customers have found tremendous value in moving away from their existing piecemeal network access solutions built on top of VPNs, which have become brittle and difficult to manage after years of accumulating tech debt. Fast-growing companies like Human Interest, Frame.io, and Persona have been able to simplify access for employees, contractors, and admins, while achieving a more robust security posture by transitioning to Twingate.</p><p>Twingate customers report that they often reduce deployment time by 80% and ongoing client setup and support load by 90% compared to their previous VPN, all while expanding their distributed workforces in a more secure way.</p><p><h3>This is just the beginning</h3></p><p>We have an ambitious 2021 product roadmap that will continue to build on the foundation that we've laid out above. We're proud of our focus on ease of use, which has allowed our customers to adopt our vision of Identity-First Networking with minimal effort.</p><p>Give Twingate a <a href="https://www.twingate.com/">try for free</a> today. We'd love to hear <a href="https://www.twingate.com/contact/">what you think</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><b>The short version:</b> Each extra drink you have per day probably takes an extra year off your life. This may or may not be true for the first 1-2 drinks per day, but it definitely is after that. If you feel like you’re drinking too much, you may want to quit; although some people succeed at drinking in moderation, people are more likely to succeed if they set out to stop drinking entirely. If you’re currently drinking more than about five drinks per day or so, you will want to take steps to avoid potentially dangerous withdrawal when you quit. Once you’ve quit, you will need to maintain your sobriety; many people find support groups or medication helpful. The support group could be Alcoholics Anonymous, but it doesn’t have to be, and there are various good secular alternatives. The medication could be an anti-craving medication like naltrexone, acamprosate, or gabapentin. You could also “tie yourself to the mast” by taking disulfiram (“Antabuse”), which makes drinking alcohol extremely unpleasant or even dangerous. People who want to pursue moderate drinking can benefit from the Sinclair method, in which they take the medication naltrexone just before drinking, which breaks the link between alcohol and neural reward. Good support and medication can raise your chances, but most people won’t succeed the first time they try to quit, and should be prepared for a two-steps-forward, one-step-back process of gradually achieving better control.</p>
<p><b>The long version:</b></p>

<h5 id="anchor1"><span id="1_Whats_a_safe_amount_to_drink_What_are_the_risks_of_drinking_more_than_that">1. What’s a safe amount to drink? What are the risks of drinking more than that?</span></h5>
<p>I’m going to start with a boring technical answer, and then move on to a meaningful answer later.</p>
<p>The boring technical answer is: experts define a “standard drink” as about the amount of alcohol in a can of beer, a glass of wine, or a shot of whiskey, usually about 12g. If you want to get fancier or more complicated than that, you can use <a href="https://www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/tools/calculators/drink-size-calculator.aspx">this calculator</a>.</p>
<p>US guidelines say that women should limit themselves to at most 14 drinks/week, and women to 7 drinks/week. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommended_maximum_intake_of_alcoholic_beverages">Other countries</a> are more permissive; I did some of my medical training in Ireland, which allows 17 for men and 11 for women.</p>
<p>(Why do women get fewer drinks? Women generally weigh less, and store more of their weight <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090302115755.htm">as fat</a> to provide an energy reserve for future childbearing. That means they have less lean mass for the alcohol to disperse through. Women also have <a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696080/">lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase</a>, a stomach enzyme that breaks down alcohol safely. I have no idea why there would be sex differences in ADH levels – please let me know if you understand this.)</p>
<p>Here’s what the data tell us about drinking and health:</p>
<center><img src="https://lorienpsych.com/htdocs/wp-content/Images/alcohol_mort.jpg"></center>
<p>Risk of death is the lowest (about 80% of the risk of a non-drinker) at about two drinks a week. On the face of it, this suggests people who drink a small amount are much healthier than people who drink nothing at all.</p>
<p>Most researchers are skeptical. Some non-drinkers are alcoholics in recovery (whose bodies have already been damaged by their previous heavy drinking). Others are very sick people who have been warned off alcohol by their doctors. Still others are poor people who can’t afford alcohol. When these unhealthy groups die at increased rates, it looks like teetotaling is bad for you, or like moderate drinking is good for you. The most recent large <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26997174/">big study</a> seems to confirm this critique (though see <a href="http://alcoholresearchforum.org/critique-183-an-unusual-analysis-of-the-association-of-alcohol-consumption-with-mortality-24-march-2016/">these objections</a>). The CDC currently <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm">sides with</a> the skeptics and says that basically any amount of drinking is at least a little bad for you, even if you stay within the recommended guidelines.</p>
<p>But a few people still believe moderate drinking helps, citing for example <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d636">this review article</a> of randomized controlled trials that showed people randomized to moderate drinking saw improvements on some cardiovascular measures. What I would really like to see are animal studies – whether animals randomized to zero vs. light alcohol consumption had higher mortality. Some people <a href="http://alcoholresearchforum.org/archives-april-2010-april-2011/genetic-factors-alcohol-use/">claim</a> these studies have been done and support light drinking, but they don’t provide links and I can’t evaluate them.</p>
<p>Right now I lean to thinking probably there is no protective effect. It’s not obvious what to do with this information. Should we assume healthy teetotalers would do just as well as the current best group, twice a week drinkers? Or extrapolate the line from heavy alcohol consumption backwards and assume they would do better than twice a week drinkers by the same amount that (eg) 30-time-a-week drinkers would do better than 32-time-a-week drinkers?</p>
<p>If we use the first method, we find that men who drink the upper limit of the guidelines have about a 5% higher mortality rate than (extrapolated) teetotalers; if we use the second method, they have more like a 20% higher rate. </p>
<p>Without doing any extrapolation or guesswork at all, just looking at the observed data, we find that men who have two drinks/day more than the limit (ie 4 drinks a day instead of just 2) have about a 10% higher risk of death than the people right at the limit. Bringing back our extrapolations, they also have a 15% – 30% higher risk than (extrapolated) teetotalers.</p>
<p>What does “10% higher risk of death” mean? You can figure it out from this graph (<a href="https://joshmitteldorf.scienceblog.com/files/2012/11/Mortality_and_LifeExpectancy1.png">source</a>):</p>
<p>Someone with a 10% higher risk of death will die about one year earlier; someone with a 30% higher risk of death will die about 4 years earlier.</p>
<p>As a very weak rule of thumb, putting these two graphs together, I think it would make sense to say that each extra drink-per-day will take about one additional year off a man’s life, and a little more off a woman’s life.</p>
<p>That roughly matches results from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-alcohol/even-one-drink-a-day-linked-to-lower-life-expectancy-idUSKBN1I42H6">this study</a>, which finds that people who drink 150 grams of alcohol weekly (a little over one drink a day) live six months shorter than people who drink less than this. People who drink about 300 grams weekly (a little over two drinks a day) live about two years less, and people who drink more than this (a catchall bin anywhere from three drinks/day up) live about five years less.</p>
<p>It also potentially matches <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4402015/">this study</a> from Scandinavia which finds that severe alcoholics (people admitted to a hospital with alcohol use disorder) die about 25 years earlier than the general population (ie around age 50), if we assume these people are drinking about 25 drinks per day, which would not be atypical for a severe alcoholic.</p>
<p>Along with increased risk of death, alcoholics are at increased risk for various unpleasant diseases, and tend to <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320091#Heavy-drinking-predicts-signs-of-aging">look</a> and feel older and be less healthy than non-drinkers of the same age. </p>
<h5 id="anchor2"><span id="2_How_can_I_tell_if_Im_an_alcoholic">2. How can I tell if I’m an alcoholic?</span></h5>
<p>Alcoholism probably isn’t <a href="https://lorienpsych.com/2020/10/30/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions-taxometrics/">a taxon</a>; there isn’t some hard-and-fast line dividing people into alcoholics and non-alcoholics. There are just people who drink more or less, and who find their drinking is harming them more or less. So only you can answer this question. Are you unhappy with the amount you’re drinking? Do you feel like you can’t stop? Is it reaching a point where it’s harmful to your health, your relationship, or your ability to do the things you want to do? Is it harmful enough that it’s worth using the label “alcoholic” to signal that you feel like things are out of control and you need to start thinking about yourself in a medical way?</p>
<p>In case that answer is too vague to be useful, people have come up with various heuristics that you can use to judge how concerned to be. The most famous is the CAGE questions:</p>
<p>1. Have you ever felt you needed to cut down on drinking?<br>
2. Have people ever annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?<br>
3. Have you ever felt guilty about drinking?<br>
4. Have you ever felt you needed a drink in the morning (“eye-opener”) to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover?</p>
<p>If you answer “yes” to at least two of the questions, you should at least consider the possibility that you might have a drinking problem. When experts do a more thorough evaluation on people who gave at least two “yes” answers to the questions above, they <a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/64/6/473/1432970">end up diagnosing on average 77% of them</a> with alcoholism.</p>
<p>Doctors very specifically don’t diagnose alcoholism based on number of drinks per day, because some people are able to drink a lot without having too many problems, and other people start having problems even at seemingly low levels. But if doctors <i>did</i> diagnose alcoholism based on drinks per day, I think the cutoff would be around 10 or 11. I’m gathering this from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/11/study-one-in-eight-american-adults-are-alcoholics/">this article</a> saying that about 12% of Americans have an alcohol use disorder, plus <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/25/think-you-drink-a-lot-this-chart-will-tell-you/">this article</a> giving deciles of alcohol use; the heaviest-drinking 10% of the population starts at about 10 drinks a day. So if we wanted to come up with a completely number-of-drinks based criterion for alcohol use disorder, and keep the same percent of the population alcoholic, it would be around 10 or 11 drinks. I have known people (especially women) who were definitely alcoholic even though they drank much less than this. I’ve also known people who seem to be doing okay with more – but these people are probably taking a decade off their lives, so I’m skeptical of their claims that they can “quit any time they want” – why don’t they want to??</p>
<h5 id="anchor3"><span id="21_But_what_is_alcoholism_exactly">— 2.1. But what is alcoholism, exactly?</span></h5>
<p>This is a good question; instead of me answering it, please accept this IOU for a broader Lorien Psychiatry page on the nature of addiction.</p>
<p>The very short version is that, while free will isn’t exactly an illusion, it’s an abstraction on more complicated calculations that your brain uses to determine what to do at any given time. One input into this calculation is based on whether similar actions have gone well or badly in the past. The brain processes information about how well an action is going using a chemical called dopamine in a structure called the nucleus accumbens; the more dopamine, the more surprisingly well the action has gone and the more you try to do it in the future. Alcohol <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12827641/">increases</a> the level of dopamine in this structure. It’s not exactly clear why, but the most likely explanation is something like – it vaguely resembles …</p></div></div></div>

It’s still there behind the scenes, but programmers use high-level Objective-C and Swift wrappers from Foundation. If something is missing, you can call an underlying C API.

<p>This is a native <a href="https://github.com/kean/Pulse">macOS app</a> written entirely in SwiftUI, from <code>@main</code> to bottom. Not a prototype, not a toy. A full-featured app. The intention is to deliver the best macOS experience possible.</p>

<p>The two main reasons this app is possible are SwiftUI and Big Sur. I have extensive experience with iOS, so I started with it. When the time came to adopt it for macOS, I was anxious. I had no idea what to expect from SwiftUI on a Mac. But thanks to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10041/">new</a> SwiftUI APIs and the Big Sur design changes, everything just made sense!</p>

<!-- <img alt="Triple column navigation on macOS using SwiftUI" class="NewScreenshot" src="https://kean.blog/images/posts/macos/00-columns.png"> -->



<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/a_grebenyuk/status/1363882900136095745?s=20">first step</a> was to get the navigation right. I knew I wanted to use triple-column navigation<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup>. SwiftUI makes this setup ease.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ContentView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>some</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>NavigationView</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>SidebarView</span><span>()</span>
            <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"No Sidebar Selection"</span><span>)</span> <span>// You won't see this in practice (default selection)</span>
            <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"No Message Selection"</span><span>)</span> <span>// You will see this</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key is the type system. What you used to configure in code, e.g. by passing a number of columns to <code>UISplitViewController</code>, you now configure using generic parameters. In my case, the type of the view is <code>NavigationView&lt;TupleView&lt;(Sidebar, Text, Text)&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Use navigation links as usual. To make the first tab active by default, pass <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink/init(_:destination:isactive:)-3v44"><code>isActive</code></a> in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink"><code>NavigationLink</code></a> initializer with a value of <code>true</code>.</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By default, the toolbar displays a title in the main panel. To disable it, I used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene/windowtoolbarstyle(_:)"><code>UnifiedWindowToolbarStyle(showsTitle: false)</code></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t use the List <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list#topics"><code>selection</code></a> API for navigation. It only exists to support single or multiple item selection of items in <em>edit</em> mode.</p>
</blockquote>
    
      



<p>The “Toggle Sidebar” button does not appear by default. To add it, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/rotatedshape/toolbar(content:)-53znx?changes=latest_mino_8"><code>.toolbar</code></a> modifier.</p>

<!-- ```swift
SidebarView(model: model)
    .toolbar {
        Button(action: toggleSidebar) {
            Image(systemName: "sidebar.left")
                .help("Toggle Sidebar")
            }
        }
    }
}
``` -->

<div><div><pre><code><span>SidebarView</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>model</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/rotatedshape/toolbar(content:)-53znx?changes=latest_mino_8"><span><span>toolbar</span></span></a> <span>{</span>

            <span>Image</span><span>(</span><span>systemName</span><span>:</span> <span>"sidebar.left"</span><span>)</span>

            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a way to hide the sidebar programmatically using <code>NavigationView</code>. I had to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapp"><code>NSApp</code></a> APIs. One of the few AppKit usages in the app.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>func</span> <span>toggleSidebar</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>NSApp</span><span>.</span><span>keyWindow</span><span>?</span><span>.</span><span>firstResponder</span><span>?</span>
        <span>.</span><span>tryToPerform</span><span>(</span><span>#selector(</span><span>NSSplitViewController.toggleSidebar(_:)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>with</span><span>:</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>To add a “Toggle Sidebar” shortcut, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/sidebarcommands"><code>SidebarCommands</code></a>.</p>

<p>To create a collapsing section, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/disclosuregroup"><code>DisclosureGroup</code></a>. You can even nest sections. To open a section programmatically, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/disclosuregroup/init(isexpanded:content:label:)"><code>isExpanded</code></a> binding.</p>

<p>With the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/windowgroup"><code>WindowGroup</code></a> API introduces in Big Sur, SwiftUI takes care of certain platform behaviors. For example, users can open more than one window from the group simultaneously. When the user double-clicks on a list item in the main panel, it opens the details in a separate window. This happens automatically.</p>



<p>It also comes with a standard set of shortcuts: <code>Command-Tilde</code> to switch between open windows, <code>Command+W</code> to close, <code>Command+M</code> to minimize, etc.</p>

<p>You can also open a new window group using <code>Command+N</code>. In my case, the app remembers the database you selected. This way you can have multiple views on the same set of logs with different filters. Very useful when investigating complex issues!</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way <code>WindowGroup</code> works is clever: it’s just struct copying. Every window created from the group maintains independent state. For example, for each new window created from the group the system allocates new storage for any <code>State</code> or <code>StateObject</code> variables instantiated by the scene’s view hierarchy.</p>

      </h2>



<p>Search is probably the most complex UI feature I built. It felt like I was pushing it.</p>

<p>The search field, the search toolbar, and how the searches are performed is not particularly interesting – same as in AppKit. What is, is how do you scroll to the next item and activate the navigation link each time the user hits the Return (↩) key?</p>

<p>For programmatic scrolling, I used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollviewreader"><code>ScrollViewReader</code></a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ConsoleContentView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@ObservedObject</span> <span>private(set)</span> <span>var</span> <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>ConsoleViewModel</span>

                <span>ConsoleMessageListView</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>model</span><span>)</span>

                    <span>}</span>

            <span>}</span>
            <span>filterToolbar</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When the user hits Return (↩), <code>ConsoleViewModel</code> updates the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published">published</a> <code>selectedObjectId</code> property value observed by the view.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every declarative framework is imperative if you try hard enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, what about activating the navigation links? We already know how to do that using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink/init(_:destination:isactive:)-3v44"><code>isActive</code></a>. But what do you do in a dynamic list? The solution I came up with is to create an array of bindings and grow it every time the number of items increases.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>ConsoleViewModel</span><span>:</span> <span>ObservableObject</span> <span>{</span>

<p>By the way, this is not the only way to navigate a list with a keyboard. By default, on macOS, List can also be navigated with “Up” and “Down” arrows!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>List</code> is not great. The performance with a large number of items (10000+) is unacceptable. The reason is the diff-based mechanism used for computing animations that you can’t disable. If you are considering displaying a large number of items in a <code>List</code>, it most likely won’t be acceptable for you.</p>

      <h2 id="text-view">
        
        
          Text View <a href="#text-view">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>



<p>A similar search is also available on a details screen. This is the only place (except for <code>NSSearchField</code>) where I had to use <code>AppKit</code> components directly. SwiftUI doesn’t yet have a wrapper for <code>NSTextView</code> (except for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/texteditor"><code>TextEditor</code></a>, but it doesn’t support attributed strings that I needed for syntax highlighting). So I had to create one.</p>

<p>Now here is the question. Does it mean that SwiftUI is somewhat incomplete? Maybe. After all, text view is a common component. But SwiftUI is built on top of AppKit, it is not going anywhere. Just because I had to wrap two components doesn’t mean that SwiftUI was in the way. Quite the opposite! The AppKit integration works great.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Datoms that share the <b>transaction-id</b>&nbsp;were added within the same transaction. Amongst others, this transactional approach makes it possible for Roam to synchronize content to your different devices and to manage complex undo operations.</p><p>Datoms that have the same <b>entity-id&nbsp;</b>are facts about the same block.</p><p>If you want to query the <b>entity-id</b> of a block, based on its block reference, you could write:</p><!--HTML generated using hilite.me--><div><pre>[<span>:find</span> <span>?e-id</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Considering the data above, this query would return the value 5.</p><h2>Attributes</h2><p>Roam stores facts about <strong>paragraphs</strong> and <strong>pages</strong>&nbsp;using <code>:block/</code> attributes. There are few minor differences between <strong>pages</strong> and <strong>paragraphs</strong>&nbsp;that I will explain in a minute, however, the basic concept you must understand, is that a <strong>page</strong> is just a special type of <strong>block</strong>. Mostly, Roam treats a&nbsp;<strong>page</strong>&nbsp;exactly the same way as a <strong>paragraph. </strong>Both are <b>blocks.</b></p>
<h3>Blocks have 2 IDs</h3>
<p>Hidden ID:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The <b>entity-id</b>&nbsp;is the real block-id, even though it is not visible through the Roam user interface. This is the ID that is used to tie information together in the database. The Entity ID identifies facts about a block, capturing parent-child relationships, and references to blocks.</li></ul>
<p>Public ID:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the block reference of a <strong>paragraph</strong>, e.g.: <code>((GGv3cyL6Y))</code>, or</li>
<li>the <code>[[Page Title]]</code> for <strong>pages</strong>. Note that pages also have a nine-character long UID - very much like the block reference, you could use these, for example, for constructing URLs that point to specific pages in your graph.</li></ul><h3>Common attributes for all blocks</h3>
<p>Every block will have the following attributes:</p>
<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:block/uid</code></td><td>The public ID, i.e. nine-character long block reference.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:create/email</code></td><td>The email address of the person who has created the block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:create/time</code></td><td>Time in milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970 midnight UTC/GMT).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:edit/email</code></td><td>The email address of the person who has edited the block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:edit/time</code></td><td>The time the block was last edited.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody></table>
<!--HTML generated using hilite.me--><div><pre>[<span>10</span> <span>:block/uid</span>		<span>"p6qzzKa-u"</span>     <span>536870940</span>]

</pre></div>
<h3 id="tree">Trees in the forest</h3>
<p>The <strong>Roam database is like a forest</strong>. Each page is a tree. The root of the tree is the page, the branches are the higher-level paragraphs; the leaves are the paragraphs at the deepest level of nesting on the page.</p>
<!--HTML generated using hilite.me--><div><pre>[[<span>Page</span>]]
<span>* </span><span>Branch</span>
  <span>* </span><span>Branch</span>
    <span>* </span><span>Leaf</span>
    <span>* </span><span>Leaf</span>
  <span>* </span><span>Leaf</span>
  <span>* </span><span>Branch</span>
    <span>* </span><span>Branch</span>
      <span>* </span><span>Leaf</span>
<span>* </span><span>Branch</span>
  <span>* </span><span>Leaf</span>
<span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For every paragraph, Roam always creates two pointers. Children reference the <b>entity-id</b>&nbsp;of their parents using <code>:block/parents</code> and parents reference the <b>entity-id</b> of their children using <code>:block/children</code>.</p>
<!--HTML generated using hilite.me--><div><pre>[<span>4</span>	<span>:block/children</span>	<span>5</span>	<span>536870917</span>]
[<span>5</span>	<span>:block/parents</span>	<span>4</span>	<span>536870918</span>]</pre></div><p>
Parents keep a list of their children in the <code>:block/children</code> attribute. This list will <u>ONLY</u> include the <b>entity-id</b> of their immediate descendants, not the grandchildren. A page will only list the top-level paragraphs on the page as its children, but not the nested paragraphs. Similarly, a paragraph will only list blocks nested right under it, not the blocks nested under the nested blocks. The lowest level blocks in the nesting (the leaves) will have no <code>:block/children</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Children also keep a list of their parents in the <code>:block/parents</code> attribute. Contrary to <code>:block/children</code>, the list of parents includes the <b>entity-id</b> of <u>ALL</u> ancestors i.e. grandparents, great grandparents, etc. A nested paragraph will have references to the parent paragraph(s) and the page as well. The top-level paragraphs on a page have the <b>entity-id</b> of the page in the <code>:block/parents</code> attribute, while paragraphs nested under another paragraph will have the <b>entity-id</b> of the higher level paragraph and the <b>entity-id</b> of the page.</p><h3>Page-only attributes</h3>
<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:node/title</code></td><td>All pages will have a title, and no paragraphs will have one.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If you want to find all pages in your database, you need to query&nbsp;<code>:node/title</code> because this property will only hold value for pages. By executing the following query you will get a table with two columns: the <strong>entity-id</strong> of each page under&nbsp;<code>?p</code> and the title of each page under&nbsp;<code>?title</code>.</p>
<!--HTML generated using hilite.me--><div><pre>[<span>:find</span> <span>?p</span> <span>?title</span>
 <span>:where</span> [<span>?p</span> <span>:node/title</span> <span>?title</span>]]
</pre></div>
<p>If you would also want to see the nine-character UID for each page, for example, to construct a link to the page, you would need to find the <code>:block/uid</code>&nbsp;attribute associated with the <code>?p</code> <strong>entity-id</strong>. Here's how the query would look like. Note how <code>?p</code> appears in both patterns in the where clause. This tells the query engine to find the title and the uid for the same entity.</p>
<!--HTML generated using hilite.me--><div><pre>[<span>:find</span> <span>?p</span> <span>?title</span> <span>?uid</span>
 <span>:where</span> [<span>?p</span> <span>:node/title</span> <span>?title</span>]
        [<span>?p</span> <span>:block/uid</span> <span>?uid</span>]]
</pre></div>

<h3>Paragraph-only attributes&nbsp;</h3>
<p><b>Every paragraph will have the following attributes:</b></p>
<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:block/page</code></td><td>Every paragraph on a page regardless of their level of nesting will also reference the <b>entity-id</b> of their page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:block/order</code></td><td>This is the sequence of the block within the page or within their level of nesting under a paragraph. You will need to sort this value to retrieve the paragraphs in the proper sequence, as they appear in the document.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:block/string</code></td><td>The contents of the block.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>:block/parents</code></td><td>The ancestors of the paragraph. For top-level paragraphs this is only the page. For nested paragraphs, this attribute lists all their ancestors leading up to (and including) the page.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><b>Optional attributes:</b></p><p>Roam will only set these attributes (only exist in the database for the paragraph) if you change the value from the default for the specific block. e.g. you set the text alignment of the block from left aligned to centered.</p>
<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:children/view-type</code></td><td><p>Specifies how to display the block’s children. Recognized values are ‘bullet’, ‘document’, ‘numbered’.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:block/heading</code></td><td>In case you set the heading level of the block to H1, H2, or H3. Allowed values of this are 1,2,3.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:block/props</code></td><td><p>This is where Roam stores the sizing of an image or iframe, the position of the slider, the setting of the Pomodoro timer, etc.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>:block/text-align</code></td><td>Alignment of the paragraph. Values are 'left', 'center', 'right', 'justify'.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>The Roam data-structure</h3>
<p>If you are wondering how to find out what attributes exist in your database, I have good news! Using a simple query, you can list all the attributes in your database.</p>
<!--HTML generated using hilite.me--><div><pre>[<span>:find</span> <span>?Namespace</span> <span>?Attribute</span>
 <span>:where</span> [<span>_</span> <span>?Attribute</span>]
[(<span>namespace </span><span>?Attribute</span>) <span>?</span><span>Namespace</span>]]</pre></div>
<p>Below is the list. Truth be told, the query above will not sort the values, and will not create the last column. I have included the slightly more advanced version of the query, which will do the sorting, in the downloadable roam.json file. I found the <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/namespace" target="_blank">namespace</a> function in the <a href="http://clojure.core/" target="_blank">clojure.core</a> documentation.</p>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Namespace</th><th>Attribute</th><th>:Namespace/Attribute</th></tr>
<tr><td>attrs</td><td>lookup</td><td>:attrs/lookup</td></tr>
<tr><td>block</td><td>children</td><td>:block/children</td></tr>
<tr><td>block</td><td>heading</td><td>:block/heading</td></tr>
<tr><td>block</td><td>open</td><td>:block/open</td></tr>
<tr><td>block</td><td>order</td><td>:block/order</td></tr>
<tr><td>bloc…</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>

However, messages can be transmitted in other ways. Twitter, text messages, phone calls and website forums could all be used to send and receive messages. Encrypted messages could also be embedded in image tags, HTML, or some other inconspicuous place.</p><h2 id="decrypt-the-same-ciphertext-to-multiple-plaintexts">Decrypt the same ciphertext to multiple plaintexts</h2><p>The same one-time pad ciphertext can be decrypted to different plaintext messages by using different pads.

</code></pre></div><h2 id="security-considerations-and-precautions">Security considerations and precautions</h2><p>Pads must be random, kept secret, only used once and destroyed immediately after use. Should the same pad be used to encrypt more than one message, those messages will be cracked. Should the pads become lost or stolen, then all the messages should be suspect.</p><p>You must assume that your opponent intercepts and stores all of your ciphertext messages indefinitely. They hope to somehow obtain the pads and decrypt the messages someday.</p><p>When used with appropriate procedures and precautions, one-time pad encrypted messages cannot be cracked. However, how the ciphertext message is sent and received may identify the communicating parties. This may or may not be an acceptable risk in your environment. For example, if a person posted a padder encrypted message to a Twitter account, the IP address, user name and date/time would be logged and stored. And, any IP address that read the message would be logged and stored too. Basically, any transmission method that uses a network (cellular, IP, etc.) may quickly reveal the location of the communicating parties.</p><p>Radio signals are directional and can be tracked. However, radio signals don’t rely on network infrastructure and require more expensive equipment and greater technical knowledge to track. With radio you only know the general time and direction from which the signal emanated. Also, it’s relatively easy to hide the source of radio signals when the transmitter is moving around in densely populated areas. The reception of radio signals cannot be tracked. Stations in range of the signal may relay the messages to stations out of range.</p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><ul><li><p>Plaintext messages, pads and ciphertext messages must only contain characters from the Padder Character Set. Capitalization, punctuation and spaces are not allowed. When creating plaintext messages, use the dash symbol ‘-’ rather than spaces to separate words. <strong>this-is-an-example-plaintext-message</strong></p></li><li><p>The pad must be as long or longer than the message. The sender and receiver should have the same numbered list of pads and know in which order to use them. There could be 31 pads for the month of January. The January 1st message would use pad number 1 for that day’s message.</p></li><li><p>One-time pad encrypted messages are not authenticated.</p></li><li><p>Padder is only intended for educational purposes and experimentation.</p></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/encryption">encryption</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/software">software</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p>JPMorgan Chase reckons its blockchain applications are “close to generating revenues,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-blockchain-space/jpmorgans-blockchain-payments-test-is-literally-out-of-this-world-idUSKBN2AO1GL?il=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>To drum up interest in those applications, JP Morgan recently tested blockchain-powered payments <strong>using satellites</strong> orbiting Earth.</p>
<p>The idea: perform <strong>decentralization theatre</strong> for corporates — from space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3987602/hype-cycle-for-the-internet-of-things-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) refers to the array of smart devices that LinkedIn influencers say could one day <strong>seamlessly communicate</strong> (and transact) with each other.</p>
<p>And if smart fridges and speakers are exchanging real value in the future, then banks will assuredly <strong>wedge themselves between</strong> and charge fees.</p>

The unit’s chief exec Umar Farooq told Reuters its satellite tests were meant to&nbsp; “explore IoT payments in a fully decentralized way,” and that “nowhere is more decentralized and detached from Earth than space.”</p>
<h2 id="h-jpmorgan-makes-the-blockchain-rules">JPMorgan makes the blockchain rules</h2>
<p>While technically true, it’s disingenuous to suggest paying a Danish satellite company to temporarily run a node for a private DLT system “decentralizes” anything — purely because of the distance between it and Jamie Dimon’s office toilet.</p>

Out of mostly a desire to help him, I thought it might make sense to write an article that allows people to understand the <em>intuition</em> behind monads first without going into crazy functional language syntax.</p><p id="bf0a">Whether or not I have succeeded in doing this is for you to judge, but let us jump right in.</p><p id="d762">I first encountered monads when they were introduced by Eugenio Moggi as a way to structure the semantics of programming languages. The formulation was elegant and clearly gave a nice mathematical shape to a very large class of programming language constructs that, until then, were only dealt with in isolation.</p><p id="ff7c">What Moggi brought forth in <a href="https://person.dibris.unige.it/moggi-eugenio/ftp/ic91.pdf" rel="noopener">that paper</a> (if you can abide the mathematics) was a depth of understanding of computation that only comes by once in a generation. Yes, it is a <em>deeply</em> intuitive paper that maps computer science intuition to solid mathematical foundations. I’m going to leave much of the mathematics out of the exposition here, but I do hope to impart the intuition.</p><p id="1f8a">Let’s start with a very simple expression: <code>getc()</code>. C programmers might recognize this as similar to a function you would call to get one character from a file. Instead of a file here, assume it is getting one character from the keyboard. It’s a simple function that produces a single character. You can use this function anywhere a character expression can be used (i.e. it nominally has the type <code>char</code>). So, for example, if we wanted to check if the user pressed the key <em>q</em>, we could do <code>(getc() == ‘q’)</code>.</p><p id="b9e6">But computationally speaking, <code>getc()</code> is anything but a simple <code>char</code>. It involves a complex set of interactions with the environment outside the program, including the operating system, the hardware, and the user. When we’re thinking about programs, the traditional wisdom (as inherited from the λ-calculus) is to only reason about values. This is fine when you’re dealing with entities entirely inside the program. But <code>getc()</code> here is forcing us to encounter the fact that there is an entire world outside the program that we must also deal with. It brings with it the fact that I/O operations can fail, or that they don’t always produce the same value, and the fact that the user may not ever press a key at all.</p><p id="027f">This is where part 1 of Moggi’s genius comes in. He intuited that a value is qualitatively different from the computation that produces the value. In other words, <code>getc()</code><strong> </strong>is a <em>computation </em>that produces a<em> </em><code>char</code> and<em> should not be conflated </em>with a<em> </em><code>char</code><em>.</em></p><p id="5eba">So, rather than give <code>getc()</code> the type <code>char</code>, let us give it the type <code>T[char]</code>, which is short for saying that it is a compu<strong>T</strong>ation (or a process) that produces a <code>char</code>. At first, this seems like a step backwards. Now we cannot use <code>getc()</code><strong> </strong>in all the places we could have used a <code>char</code>, so <code>(getc() == ‘q’)</code> is no longer correct since the types on either side of the <code>==</code> are different. What are we to do now?</p><p id="ca74">Let me introduce you to a new pair of words: <em>injection</em> and <em>projection</em>. When we take a value of type <code>char</code> and embed it within another type, like <code>T[char]</code>, it is known as an <em>injection</em>. The inverse of an injection is known as a <em>projection</em>. This is where we extract the injected value out of the embedding. In other words, we project the <code>char</code> out of the <code>T[char]</code>. In general, injection and projection are always designed to be inverses of each other: They compose to the identity function.</p><p id="2c33">So, will a projection operator now allow us to get the <code>char</code> out of the <code>T[char]</code>? What does this projection even look like? For a computational process like <code>getc()</code>, we “project<em>”</em> out of <code>T[char]</code> by waiting for the I/O call to terminate, present the value, and then just work with value, using it like we would use another char and any other value derived from it. Once we are out of computation-land and in value-land, however, we have now completely glossed over the fact that there is a whole computation that produced the value and puts us back where we started (i.e., unable to hold on to the outside world that <code>getc()</code> dragged us into. )</p><p id="8b86">This is where part 2 of Moggi’s genius kicks in. He proposed a somewhat limited projection operator that he called <code>let</code> with which we can rewrite our simple test above somewhat like this (this is not the final form, but it’s a good place to start):</p><pre><span id="cb60">let c = getc() in (c == ‘q’)</span></pre><p id="0865">Let me break this down a bit. Here, <code>c</code> has the type <code>char</code> — not <code>T[char]</code>.<strong> </strong>The job of this <code>let</code> here is to project the <code>char</code> out of the <code>T[char]</code>, bind it to the name <code>c</code>, and allow it to be used as a <code>char</code> in the body (the expression after the <code>in</code>). In this case, projection means waiting for <code>getc()</code> to return a character.</p><p id="b1aa">If <code>let</code> were performing a standard projection operation, this expression would produce a boolean at the end. This whole expression, however, <em>still</em> has an I/O operation (i.e. a computation) involved in producing this boolean. This means that this expression does not really represent a boolean but is a <em>computation</em> that produces a boolean. So the right thing to do is to give this whole <code>let</code> expression the type <code>T[boolean]</code>, which means that the body of the <code>let</code> must return the type <code>T[boolean]</code>.</p><p id="afc1">In Moggi’s formulation, this type is <em>required</em> for all projecting <code>let</code><strong> </strong>expressions and is enforced by the type-checker. To make sure we can meet this requirement, we introduce an operator, <code>η</code>, whose sole purpose is to inject a value of type <code>τ</code> into <code>Τ[<em>τ</em>]</code><strong>. </strong>It forces us to remember that this value was generated from a computation. So we rewrite the <code>let</code> above like this:</p><pre><span id="207f">let c = getc() in η(c == ‘q’)</span></pre><p id="708a">Now, the type of this expression is <code>T[boolean]</code>. In general, this means that the fact that a value was generated from a computation is never forgotten. If we must use the value produced by this <code>let</code> elsewhere, we must remember that it was a <code>T[boolean]</code>. To extract this boolean, we would need another <code>let</code>, and whose body would be <code>T[something]</code> and so on. If you’ve understood this paragraph and want to show off to your friends, throw the words “associativity law of monads” around.</p><p id="d5e1">Taking this to its logical conclusion, any program using a computation finally always produces an answer of the type <code>T[x]</code><strong> </strong>instead of a value of the type <code>x</code>. The dirty little secret of monads is that there is one final projection that we need to do to actually extract the <code>x</code> out of the <code>T[x]</code>. In practice, each <code>T</code> is always accompanied by such a projection operation, but it must be used only in very clearly identified areas where we no longer seek to retain computational properties of <code>T[]</code>.</p><p id="b249">The type <code>T[]</code>, along with the accompanying <code>η</code>, and <code>let</code> is the monad (also sometimes given the juicy name of “Kleisli triple”). The actual name comes from a category-theoretic structure that formalizes this idea in more math than most people need to know. That’s it. While <code>T[]</code> is a stand-in for computations involving I/O in our case, it can stand in for a wide range of different types of computations that we’ll see below.</p><p id="3de8">That’s all there is to monads. The purpose of this formulation is that it clearly partitions the ill-behaved world of computations into the bindings (the part of the <code>let</code> before the <code>in</code> which binds names to values projected out of computations) of the <code>let </code>and the well-behaved functional world in the body of the <code>let</code>. The world inside the bindings is full of the uncertainties associated with the bindings, but the world inside the body is clean and yet preserves the fact that the values were derived from computations.</p><p id="de70">So even though I have “effects” (which is the name we give to these computations) in my program, I can reason about most of the program without giving too much thought to the effects because they are now nicely packaged in <code>T[]</code>. The rules of <code>let</code> don’t let me forget when I’m dealing with a computation and when I’m dealing with a value produced by that computation.</p><p id="58a1">The range of computations that can be treated like this is large. I/O is one example above. Another frequently used computation type is “Uncertainty” in the sense that a value may or may not exist. For example, you may be looking up a key in a hash table that may or may not be found. This type of computation is packaged into the <code>Option</code> monad. The way to think about this is that if the <code>let</code> encounters non-existence while extracting the value out of the computation (i.e. the hash table does not have the key we’re looking for), the entire <code>let</code> will be non-existent. Otherwise, when the value exists, the body of the <code>let</code> will have a value as well. In <code>Option</code>, injection of a value (<code>η</code>) is done using <code>Some</code> in Scala or <code>Just</code> in Haskell. Other primitives (such as the <code>get</code> from a hash table, which, in this case, is analogous to <code>getc</code>) automatically produce a value in <code>Option</code>.</p><p id="dba4">Another commonly used computation type is “Asynchronous.” In this case, the computation is occurring asynchronously — possibly in another system altogether (such as a database) — and this computation is going to generate the value of interest. This type of computation is typically packaged as the <code>Future</code> monad. The <code>Future</code> represents a computation that will produce the value we will get eventually. The binding in the <code>let</code> waits for the computation to produce this value and only evaluates the body when the value is ready. Moreover, the <code>let</code> as a whole now represents a computation that will, at some point, produce the value in the body of the <code>let</code>. In keeping with our idea of how <code>let</code> works, the <code>let</code> expression is itself a <code>Future</code>.</p><p id="e308">This is a very clean way to structure programs that include effects. Moggi used it to define the semantics of effects like mutable state, continuations etc., but it was Phil Wadler who <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf" rel="noopener">extended</a> their use to functional programming. Along with Simon Peyton Jones and others, he led their incorporation into Haskell. Subsequently, they have been incorporated into many other programming …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Alpha Centauri A and B are Sun-like stars that orbit each other with a period of 80 years, forming the binary system known as Alpha Centauri AB. Meanwhile, Alpha Centauri C (aka Proxima Centauri) is a faint red dwarf star that slowly orbits the AB duo 0.21 light-years away. We already know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b" target="_blank">Proxima Centauri has a planet in its habitable zone</a>, but the planet is likely tidally locked and orbits a flare-prone star, so it’s probably not a great place to find life.

The research project, called <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/activities/vltsv/nearsd.html" target="_blank">NEAR</a>, looks for planets’ blackbody thermal emissions in a tight 10-micron infrared band while blotting out most of their stars’ light with a coronagraph. It was funded by Breakthrough Watch (which is part of the Yuri Milner-funded Breakthrough Initiatives that also hopes to <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/3" target="_blank">laser-accelerate a probe to the Alpha Centauri system sometime ‘soon’</a>). NEAR has the only coronagraph on Earth that could potentially image this planet today, but JWST, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and a bunch of upcoming ground-based coronagraphs should usher in a new era of direct exoplanet imagery and atmosphere analysis. This is all very exciting because certain atmospheric compositions could be strong indicators of life—<a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25252/chapter/6" target="_blank">such as methane</a>, or even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05027" target="_blank">pollution</a>—although <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/blog/scale-of-life/" target="_blank">confirming any detection will be incredibly hard</a>.</p><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><p> <a href="#news-in-brief">¶</a><strong id="news-in-brief">News in brief.&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html" target="_blank">SpaceX raised an additional $850 million</a>, valuing the company at $74 billion, 60% more than last August's $46 billion valuation—Musk also shared that Starlink will require an investment of $10 billion, but could generate $30 billion annually; SpaceX also <a href="https://twitter.com/bocachicagal/status/1364352262160572421?s=21" target="_blank">hot fired Starship SN10</a>—launch could happen in the next week if data looks good; <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/02/18/green-run-update-sls-team-finalizing-preparations-for-second-hot-fire-test/" target="_blank">NASA is planning to repeat their SLS hot fire test on the 25th</a>, with <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/01/29/green-run-update-nasa-proceeds-with-plans-for-second-hot-fire-test/" target="_blank">less conservative test parameters</a> (the test will require at least 250 seconds to pass requirements); the Russian <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/02/17/russian-cargo-craft-arrives-u-s-space-freighter-launches-saturday/" target="_blank">Progress 77</a> and <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/02/20/antares-rocket-launches-heavy-cargo-load-to-international-space-station/" target="_blank">Northrop Grumman ‘S.S.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  In the history of shortwave receivers, the Wadley loop played an
  important role. It was invented by the South African engineer Trevor
  Wadley in 1946 and it was applied in professional shortwave receivers
  from Racal in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s it was popular in
  amateur shortwave receivers until it gave way to PLL synthesizer
  circuits.

</p><p>
  It is a very clever circuit that made it possible to construct
  shortwave receivers that covered the entire HF spectrum with good
  image rejection, good dial accuracy and good frequency stability
  (adequate for SSB). Circuit complexity and cost were modest compared
  to other receiver designs that met the same requirements.

</p><p>
  The Wadley loop utilizes two tuning knobs that tune two different
  continuously variable frequency oscillators (VFOs). The first tuning
  knob tunes to the required megahertz band from 0 to 29. Though it
  controls a continuously variable oscillator, it appears to act as a
  band switch. Due to drift cancelation, any deviation from an integer
  multiple of 1MHz is canceled out. The second tuning knob tunes to
  the exact frequency within one megahertz band.
 
  
</p><h2>History of shortwave receivers</h2>

<p>
  The very first shortwave receivers used regenerative circuits. They
  typically had one or more RF amplifiers (vacuum tubes) with tuned
  circuits between them. All of these tuned circuits were tuned to the
  received frequency. This is called a TRF (Tuned Radio Frequency)
  receiver. The final RF amplification tube had positive feedback,
  such that it nearly oscillated but not quite. This provided much
  gain and selectivity, but setting the feedback level just right was
  critical. Too much and the circuit would oscillate. Satisfactory
  results could already be had with just the regenerative tube without
  any other amplifiers before it. But if you made such receiver to
  oscillate, the whole neighborhood would be treated to a howling
  sound. This was a problem especially in the normal broadcast bands
  (mediumwave and in Europe also longwave).

</p><p>
  After 1930, the superheterodyne receiver would be used nearly
  universally.  It would provide uniform and good nearby selectivity
  across the tuning range, something a TRF receiver could not do. Plus
  that you did not treat the whole neighborhood to a howling sound if
  you did not know how to tune properly. In a superheterodyne
  receiver, a variable oscillator is used to mix the received signal
  to a fixed frequency, the Intermediate Frequency of IF. Further
  amplification and filtering is performed at that fixed frequency. By
  varying the oscillator frequency you tune to a different station. As
  the oscillator is at a frequency different from the received
  frequency and the signal is not very close to the antenna
  input. radiation from the local oscillator is typically not a
  problem for the neighbors.
  
</p><p>
  Around World War 2, even professional communications receivers were
  still standard superheterodynes. They may have used a higher than
  standard IF and an extra tuned RF stage to improve image rejection,
  but the basic system was the same.

</p><p>
  In the 1950s and 1960s many professional communications receivers
  would use double conversion (two different IF frequencies). Further
  they would use one carefully calibrated Variable Frequency
  Oscillator (VFO) and mix its output with numerous different crystal
  frequencies to obtain the local oscillator signal for all bands.
  This way the VFO could have only one tuning range at a comparatively
  low frequency, so its stability and dial accuracy could be good
  enough for SSB and RTTY. Double conversion for these receivers still
  meant IF frequencies of 1 to 3MHz, certainly not 40MHz or higher.

</p><p>
  For example the German Rohde &amp; Schwarz EK07 receiver of the 1960s
  has a first IF of 3.3MHz (for the higher bands) and it has a VFO at
  a 3.4-6.4MHz, a 3MHz wide range. To obtain the required
  stability and dial accuracy for such a comparatively wide range it
  relied heavily on mechanical precision engineering, rather than clever
  circuit design.
   
</p><p>
  One brand of professional communications receivers however, used
  the Wadley loop. This brand was Racal, producer of the famous RA17
  receivers.  And yes, it does use a first IF of around 40MHz, hence it
  does not require special treatment of the lower bands (which would
  need single conversion if the first IF was lower). Now the RA17 did
  use mechanical precision engineering for the VFO, but the
  requirements were less strict than for the EK07 (having only a third
  of the tuning range). And the number of switches and band-dependent
  filters was drastically reduced compared to the EK07.

</p><p>
  In 1973 the same Wadley loop was introduced in a consumer grade
  receiver, the Barlow Wadley XCR30. Although its performance was much
  less than that of the Racal, it cost only a small fraction (around
  1/25th of price of the Racal). Its performance was much better than
  that of any general coverage receivers you could buy in this price
  range. The Yaesu FRG-7 was introduced in 1977 and it performed
  considerably better than the Barlow Wadley. 
  
</p><p>
  The Wadley loop had its limitations though and in the 1970s,
  professional communications receivers moved to PLL synthesizers to
  generate their tunable local oscillator signals to mix the received
  signal to a high first IF. Amateur receivers followed suit after
  1980. In the meantime there were some very interesting designs that
  combined a VFO (tuning a 1MHz wide range) with a PLL synthesizer to
  generate 1MHz multiples. This system was used by the Kenwood R1000
  and Yaesu FRG-7700.

</p><p>
  Modern receivers use direct digital synthesis (DDS) instead of (or
  combined with) PLL synthesizers. In the 1990s some high end
  communications receivers digitized the final IF signal and did the
  IF filtering and demodulation digitally in a DSP (digital signal
  processor). This technique is now commonplace, even in cheap
  receivers. Instead of a dedicated DSP chip one can use the power of a
  modern personal computer to do the job. There is now a trend to use
  a low first (and only) intermediate frequency, typically less than
  48kHz, in the range of normal sound cards. To suppress the image
  frequency, one can use two mixers and two AD converters, each fed by
  oscillator signals of the same frequency and 90 degrees apart. This
  is called quadrature mixing.

</p><p>
  As of 2016 it is now even possible to directly digitize the entire HF
  spectrum from 0 to 30MHz and do all further processing in a
  computer. No more mixers, no more image frequencies (but you still
  need good anti-aliasing filters).

  
</p><h2>The superheterodyne receiver</h2>

<p>
Let's start with an ordinary superheterodyne circuit for a standard
LW/MW radio, whose diagram is shown below. Such radios were made from
the 1930s to the 1990s. The received signal (either in the longwave
range 150-350kHz or in the mediumwave range 530-1620kHz) is fed
through a preselector, typically a parallel resonant LC circuit of a
fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The coil could be wound on a
ferrite bar, so the coil itself would act as an antenna. The received
signal is mixed with a variable oscillator to obtain the desired 455kHz
intermediate frequency. The oscillator also contains a resonant LC
circuit containing a fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The
variable capacitor is typically a dual variable capacitor where both
capacitors are on a single shaft so they are varied both by rotating
the shaft. Both the preselector and the oscillator have two tuning
ranges. The coils for both ranges can be switched using a band switch.

</p><p>
<img src="https://lennartb.home.xs4all.nl/radio/superhet.svg" width="1000" alt="Block diagram of a superheterodyne receiver">

</p><p>
The 455kHz IF signal is fed through a series of narrow band filters
and amplifiers. The filters select the 455kHz signal with a well
defined bandwidth (around 10kHz in an AM broadcast receiver). The
amplified signal is then demodulated using a diode detector. The
demodulated signal is further amplified and fed to a speaker.

</p><p>
In traditional radios these filters were constructed from transformers
and capacitors. In more modern radios you would find ceramic
resonators. Communications receivers would contain several ceramic
filters with different bandwidths, that can be
selected. Communications receivers would also contain a BFO, a Beat
Frequency Oscillator that oscillates near the 455kHz IF. The diode
detector could then be replaced by a product detector, which is
basically another mixer.

</p><p>
Finally we would have an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit. The
amplified IF signal is detected by another diode and then smoothed
using a much larger capacitor to eliminate all modulation and just
retain the carrier level. This signal is used to control (reduce) the
gain of the IF amplifiers. This reduces the effect of fading and it
reduces the difference in audio level between strong and weak
stations.

  
</p><h2>Problems with the superheterodyne for shortwave</h2>

<p>
  The standard superheterodyne works surprisingly well for mediumwave
  and longwave. But if we move on to shortwave, we will run into the
  problem of image frequencies. In a superheterodyne circuit, two
  frequencies will mix to the desired IF (f1) if you tune the
  oscillator to a given frequency f2. f2+f1 and f2-f1. So if you tune
  the oscillator to 1455kHz and the IF is 455kHz, both an input signal
  of 1000kHz (f2-f1) and an input signal of 1910kHz (f1+f2) will mix
  to the IF. We do have a tunable preselector and 1910kHz (unwanted) is far
  removed from 1000kHz (wanted), so there will be no problem.

</p><p>
  But on shortwave the situation is different. If you tune to
  15100kHz, the image frequency is at 16010kHz, well within the range
  of a single resonant LC circuit used a a preselector.

</p><p>
  There are two straightforward ways to reduce the
  problem. Professional shortwave receivers of the 1940s would
  typically use both methods combined:

And now, with full SVG support at our disposal, it's time to put a stop to their use, once and for all.</p><h2 id="flawed-icon-fonts">Flawed Icon Fonts</h2><h3 id="flash-of-unstyled-content-(fouc)">Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)</h3><p>When utilizing <code>@font-face</code>, you are instructing the browser to make an HTTP request for the required font file. This request isn't immediately dispatched either. When the browser begins parsing the HTML and all linked files referenced in the markup, it is building the Document Object Model (DOM) in realtime. When a linked font is found, the request is fired. How long it takes to retrieve the font can depend on the size of the font asset, network conditions, and user hardware.</p><p>While waiting for the font asset, the browser will choose to display the textual content of the HTML before actually receiving it. This results in a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). These flashes can be very jarring to your visitors. Icon fonts typically assign their glyphs to codepoints outside of the normal range that most normal fonts operate in. However, if they do not, it is possible that random characters or glyphs will appear in place of your icons before the font is fully loaded.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: It is possible to use newer directives, such as <code>preload</code>, on font resources to avoid FOUC. However, this does not solve all the other issues defined in this article and is not recommended.</p></blockquote><h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3><p>Icon fonts are notoriously bad for accessibility and can lead to some frustrating experiences for those who rely on assistive technologies.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Treated like text</strong> — The browser treats fonts like text because that is what fonts are supposed to be. Screen readers have become increasingly smarter over the years, but they still have a hard time discerning what is legible text and what is a pictogram. Most screen readers will read aloud text inserted via CSS, so when they come across your icons they may say "unpronounceable," or they may be skipped entirely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stylesheet overrides</strong> — Those with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basics/ced/fastfacts.htm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">visual impairments</a> often use custom stylesheets to override default styles of the websites they visit to make them easier to use. This might include changing color schemes, increasing font size or weight, or even changing the font face completely. If your site relies on icons in a non-contextual way, someone using an assistive font (e.g. <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OpenDyslexic</a>) will cause your icons to be replaced and disappear completely, potentially leaving your web site unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cannot provide metadata</strong> — The process of implementing an icon font on the web requires the use of the <code>::before</code> or <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. Semantically, the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements are meant to add cosmetic content to an existing element. For icon fonts, this makes sense as long as the icon is being used contextually with another element. However, there are many times in which an icon is used as the primary focus. For example, an "x" for "close" or a house for returning "home". By themselves, these icons don't provide any semantical information about their contents; You cannot label them or describe them directly.</p></li></ol><h3 id="size-and-maintainability">Size and Maintainability</h3><p>Icon fonts are not cheap assets. Every time a visitor downloads your icon font, they are downloading every icon you intend to use anywhere on your site, regardless if they see them all or not. That fact alone makes icon fonts difficult, and rather annoying, to maintain. If your icon font contains 200 icons and you use 10 of the, you are forcing your visitors to download 190 icons that they'll never see. This will degrade your visitor's experience by increasing load times and extending FOUC.</p><p>Maintaining an icon font means adding and removing icons as necessary to keep the size of the font, and subsequent stylesheets, to a minimal. This also means that every time you update your font, you need to invalidate your visitor's cache of the assets and force them to re-download them.</p><h3 id="degraded-visual-quality">Degraded Visual Quality</h3><p>All modern browsers and operating system employ anti-aliasing on text to some degree. Textual anti-aliasing is agnostic about whether or not your font is made up of letters and numbers or pictograms. This has the potential for negative side-effects in terms of visual quality, especially if you stack glyphs to make multicolor icons. Your icons may look blurry or misaligned.</p><h3 id="difficult-to-style%2Fposition">Difficult to Style/Position</h3><p>As if I haven't said it enough, icon fonts are fonts first and icons second. This mean that your icons follow text-based CSS rules, such as <code>font-size</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code>, <code>line-height</code>, etc. This can make positioning icons more difficult and less consistent. Additionally, icon font glyphs are monochromatic, meaning any stylistic changes you make affect the entire glyph.</p><p><img src="https://www.irigoyen.dev/assets/blog/svg-logo.png" alt="SVG Logo"></p><h2 id="svg's-to-the-rescue!">SVG's to the Rescue!</h2><p>With the release of Chromium-powered version Microsoft's Edge browser in early 2020, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) became fully supported across all major browsers. Even before that, SVGs have been supported in all browsers since 2012, <a href="https://caniuse.com/svg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">albeit with some scaling caveats in Internet Explorer and pre-Chromium Edge</a>. And guess what? SVGs are <em>awesome</em> for web icons!</p><h3 id="icons-just-work">Icons Just Work</h3><p>SVG image data is stored directly in your HTML document. As soon as the browser processes it, it renders it. You don't have to wait for other HTTP requests to complete as you would with an icon font.</p><h3 id="better-accessibility">Better Accessibility</h3><p>SVGs have built-in accessibility features that give them the edge over using icon fonts.</p><ul><li>They are semantically image elements.</li><li>Providing metadata is super easy. Simply provide a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>&lt;desc&gt;</code></a> element in your SVG container. Screen readers will pick these values up and read something of use to your visitor. And because SVGs are just elements in your HTML, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ARIA attributes</a>, such as <code>aria-labelledby</code> with ease.</li></ul><h3 id="easier-to-maintain">Easier to Maintain</h3><p>Compared one-to-one, a collection of 100 SVGs versus a WOFF2 of 100 icon glyphs will be larger. However, the benefits of SVGs easily outweigh an icon font implementation.</p><p>With SVGs, you will only be including the icons that are required for that individual page, directly in your code. The most efficient way to do this is by using the SVG <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/defs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> element</a> to define your icons once, and then referring to them with the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element. You can also inline your SVG icons directly, however if you use the same icon multiple times on the same page, you're just adding to overall page weight.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're creating a Single Page Application (SPA), be sure to look into proper <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">code-splitting</a> techniques to keep your bundle sizes down.</p></blockquote><p>Another advantage is that you do not need to maintain a font and its supporting CSS files outside of your site. A common practice for those who do use icon fonts is to cherry-pick the icons they need and rebuild a smaller font that only includes those icons. Utilizing SVG icons allows you to do this within your codebase without the need for generating the font assets in external tools.</p><h3 id="sharp-dressed-images">Sharp-Dressed Images</h3><p>SVGs are straight up vector images. Anti-aliasing methods employed by your browser or operating system on text have no effect on SVGs and your icons will be noticeably sharper.</p><h3 id="full-css-control">Full CSS Control</h3><p>With SVGs, you have access to all the same CSS controls as with a font and more! You can directly target specific parts of a multi-part icon and apply different style to each. You may also use SVG-specific CSS controls, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>stroke</code></a> property.</p><p>Additionally, SVGs are simply the size they are. They are not affected by text-based CSS rules.</p><h3 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h3><p>To fully support the use of SVGs on your site, make sure you're following other common best practices:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimize your SVGs</strong> — <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Run your SVG images through an optimizer</a> to get the size down. (Most, if not all, icon libraries that offer SVG packages do this by default.)</li><li><strong>Enable Compression</strong> — Configure your server to send all textual assets (HTML, JS, CSS) with <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=brotli" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brotli</a> (or GZIP). This will include the SVG data in your HTML and/or JS files.</li><li><strong>Cache effectively</strong> — Set appropriate caching headers so your visitors only download things as they change. Since your SVGs will be part of your HTML and/or JS files, you'll only want your visitors to download them again if they change.</li></ul><h2 id="get-started-with-svg-icons">Get Started with SVG Icons</h2><p>Most major icon libraries offer SVG packages of the library. Two popular icon libraries, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/svg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Material Design Icons</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>, both have packages you can install via <code>npm</code>.</p><p>If you're using a framework, many of the major icon libraries also have released packages for the more popular ones so that you can get going fairly quickly. For example, if you're using <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">React</a>, both Material Design Icons and Font Awesome have easy solutions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Material Design Icons</strong> - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/react" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@mdi/react</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/js" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@mdi/js</a></p><pre><code><span>import</span> Icon <span>from</span> <span>'@mdi/react'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> mdiCoffee <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@mdi/js'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> element <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span>Icon path<span>=</span><span>{</span>mdiCoffee<span>}</span> size<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Font Awesome</strong> - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@fortawesome/react-fontawesome</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons</a></p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> FontAwesomeIcon <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> faCoffee <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> element <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span>FontAwesomeIcon icon<span>=</span><span>{</span>faCoffee<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Both of these solutions only bundle the icons you use because of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">tree-shaking</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Continued use of icon fonts is a detriment to your visitors and a time-sink for you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elixir in Production is a series where we interview people that have used Elixir for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs.</p><p>Our today’s guest is Alex Reichert, the co-founder of <a href="https://papercups.io/">Papercups</a>, an open-source customer messaging tool.</p><p>In the interview, we talk about their open-source involvement, the benefits of Elixir for their startup, and which libraries they have found to be useful for their project.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>Papercups is an open-source alternative to customer messaging tools like Intercom, Drift, and Crisp. Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to communicate and build relationships with their customers across various channels.</p><p>At the moment, our core product is a customizable live chat widget that people can embed on their websites, through which they can message their customers in real time. Being open-source, we also make it possible for people to host our app on their own servers. This is particularly important for companies that care a lot about data privacy.</p><p>Kam and I started Papercups for a couple of reasons. We had both felt the pain of building out messaging software at our previous companies and wanted to build something extremely developer-friendly and customizable. We also felt that companies should be able to own and have complete control over all of their customer data. So these are the problems we’re striving to solve.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ma/majwcz4l.card.jpg" alt="Alex Reichert" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="could-you-talk-a-little-about-the-stack-of-papercups%3F">Could you talk a little about the stack of Papercups?</h3><p>Papercups is built on top of an Elixir/Phoenix API, backed by a PostgreSQL database. At the moment, all of our frontend code is built with React/TypeScript. (Though I’d love to explore LiveView at some point!)</p><p>For authentication, we’re using the <a href="https://github.com/danschultzer/pow">Pow</a> library. And for our workers and job processing, we use <a href="https://github.com/sorentwo/oban">Oban</a>.</p><h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-choosing-elixir-for-a-saas-product-like-papercups%3F">What are the benefits of choosing Elixir for a SaaS product like Papercups?</h3><p>Since our core functionality revolves mostly around real-time communication, Elixir (and Phoenix) gave us a lot of super useful tooling right out of the box. Though we jumped into the project without any prior Elixir experience, I believe it allowed us to move a lot faster than we may have otherwise, even with a more familiar language.</p><p>I mean, we ended up managing to both teach ourselves the basics of Elixir and ship our MVP… all within ~3 weeks! And it’s not like we’re geniuses or anything. Most of the credit goes to the language, the tooling, the documentation, and the community support.</p><p>At a more technical level, Elixir also scales quite nicely for our use case. We use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Phoenix Channels</a> to manage all of our chat threads, where each connection is backed by a lightweight BEAM process, working in parallel and maintaining its own state. As the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">docs</a> say:</p><blockquote>
<p>This architecture scales well; Phoenix Channels can support millions of subscribers with reasonable latency on a single box, passing hundreds of thousands of messages per second. And that capacity can be multiplied by adding more nodes to the cluster.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="are-there-any-libraries-or-frameworks-that-you-would-especially-like-to-feature%3F">Are there any libraries or frameworks that you would especially like to feature?</h3><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/sorentwo/oban">Oban</a>, which we use for our background workers and asynchronous tasks.</p><p>I loved how easy it was to set up. In my experience, most job processing libraries require setting up something like Redis or MongoDB to manage everything, but Oban works with PostgreSQL right out of the box. I loved that it “just works” without requiring any additional dependencies. (This is especially nice for the people that want to self-host our product because it makes it simpler to maintain.)</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-papercups-with-elixir%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing Papercups with Elixir?</h3><p>Since we jumped into it without any prior knowledge or experience with Elixir, it took some time for me to wrap my head around GenServers and Phoenix Channels. It just wasn’t something I was used to. Reading Saša Jurić’s <em>Elixir in Action</em> definitely helped me understand those concepts better. I highly recommend that book.</p><p>Setting up authentication was also a bit tricky since a lot of the examples I found online were written for server-rendered apps. But auth is always a challenge!</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Yes! I’m really proud of how everything has turned out so far. It’s been a lot of fun to work on.</p><h3 id="i%E2%80%99ve-seen-papercups-make-a-lot-of-effort-in-introducing-new-people-to-open-source-elixir-with-beginner-friendly-issues-and-other-assistance.-how-important-is-the-connection-to-open-source-for-papercups%3F">I’ve seen Papercups make a lot of effort in introducing new people to open-source Elixir with beginner-friendly issues and other assistance. How important is the connection to open-source for Papercups?</h3><p>I’d love for our project to give more developers a chance to get their feet wet with Elixir. We still have some work to do to improve engagement with the open-source community, but we have a few ideas in the works that I’m excited about.</p><p>Kam and I really want to make our products more and more “hackable”, in the sense that developers can build completely customizable chat (and other messaging) products on top of our APIs.  For example, we’ve had a few frontend developers reach out about building their own completely custom chat UI on top of our APIs. Some are using Svelte, others are using Flutter, and some want to use Vue. We want to support all of these use cases.</p><p>We’ve also had several backend developers reach out about building “plugins” that would allow them to do things like connecting their own NLP (natural language processing) APIs into Papercups to manage automating responses and building their own bots. This makes me really excited to see what the open-source community will come up with, which is why over the next couple months we want to invest more into our API documentation, webhook events, and other forms of customizability.</p><h3 id="if-a-person-wants-to-contribute-to-papercups%2C-what-are-the-steps-they-should-take%3F">If a person wants to contribute to Papercups, what are the steps they should take?</h3><p>The easiest way to get started is to join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/papercups-io/shared_invite/zt-h0c3fxmd-hZi1Zp8~D61S6GD16aMqmg">public Slack workspace</a> and let us know you’re interested in contributing! I’m always happy to help people find a good ticket to start with.</p><p>Otherwise, we try to regularly add “good first issues” on GitHub, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">here</a>.</p><p>For anyone interested in learning Elixir, I’d highly recommend first thinking of a project that excites you, rather than just jumping into tutorials. This was a game changer for me. I had personally spent a bit of time tinkering with Elixir tutorials, but I would either quickly become bored or find that I hadn’t really learned much in the end, since I was mostly just copy/pasting code.</p><p>By having the goal of building a prototype for Papercups, it very much helped me accomplish the secondary goal of learning Elixir. It really motivated me to figure things out for myself.</p><p>Also big thanks to the community on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a> workspace for helping me out whenever I had any noob questions :)</p><hr><p>I would like to thank Alex for the interview and wish Papercups the best of luck in conquering the market: we love open-source projects like these. ❤️ They have recently launched <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/papercups-2-0">Papercups 2.0</a> on Product Hunt, so I’d highly suggest checking them out if you’re interested.</p><p>If you wish to read more stories like these, don’t forget to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/serokell">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://serokell.medium.com/">Medium</a>, or <a href="https://dev.to/serokell">Dev</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

	<p>The House of Representatives in North Dakota passed a bill on Monday to make mask mandates illegal in the future, <a href="https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/6899976-North-Dakota-House-advances-bill-barring-government-from-mandating-masks">reports</a> Grand Forks Herald.</p>
<h3>North Dakota House votes to make mask mandates illegal</h3>
<p>Rep. Jeff Hoverson who sponsored the bill called the mask mandate diabolical silliness. He added that “our state is not a prison camp,” the Herald reported. <a href="https://insiderpaper.com/new-us-bill-will-help-small-news-publishers-against-big-tech/">The bill</a> comes three months after North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) imposed a mask mandate across the state.</p>
<p>Moreover, the legislation summarizes that “A state or local elected official, the state, or a political subdivision of the state may not mandate an individual in this state use a <a href="https://insiderpaper.com/apple-face-mask/">face mask</a>, face shield, or other face covering.”</p>
<p>It also rules out using a face mask, shield, or covering a condition for entry, education, employment, or services. The bill to make mask mandates illegal also notes that “If a state or local elected official, the state, or a political subdivision of the state recommends an individual in this state use a face mask, shield, or covering, the official or entity shall provide notice the recommendation is not mandatory.”</p>
<h3>Mask wearing is essential to prevent Covid-19</h3>
<p>Reportedly, there was a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases after Burgum’s mask mandate. According to the Herald, many GOP supporters of the state bill do not believe that mask-wearing prevents the spread of COVID-19. Whereas, several health experts, including the top infectious diseases expert, <span data-behavior="rolloverpeople">Anthony Fauci</span>, have stated that mask-wearing is necessary to control the <a href="https://insiderpaper.com/coronavirus-wuhan-lab-roland-wiesendanger/">coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wearing a cloth mask over a medical mask can decrease the spread of COVID-19. Whereas, data from the CDC showed North Dakota confirmed over 94,000 coronavirus cases and 1,438 deaths since the <a href="https://insiderpaper.com/top-10-deadliest-pandemics/">pandemic</a> started.</p>
<h3>Bill to make mask mandates illegal passed 50-44</h3>
<p>The Grand Forks Herald&nbsp;reported that the bill passed 50-44 and will now proceed to the state Senate.</p>
<p>Several states, including Iowa, Montana, and Mississippi have started lifting mask mandates. Although Joe Biden made efforts to urge a nation-wide mask mandate which could continue throughout the next year.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It's wild: Almost everything I worked on has become a great success on a global scale. I was struck by this fact earlier today when the news came out that Codecademy, where I was a founding engineer, is now a <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1364296435059974149">fast-growing business</a>. The news came on the heels of our <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">Series A announcement</a> at <a href="https://repl.it/">Replit</a>, where we shared some great numbers too. At Facebook, I was a founding engineer on React Native, which also had a <a href="https://shopify.engineering/react-native-future-mobile-shopify">fantastic last year</a>. And all the <a href="https://amasad.me/2016">open-source projects</a> I've been part of --  Babel and Jest most famously -- became standard tools that measurably increased productivity and changed industries.</p>
<p>Across all my work -- the millions of developers we helped mint, the CS teachers we empowered, and the entrepreneurs we enabled -- I've probably had a significant impact on the world economy, perhaps even meaningfully increased productivity. </p>
<p>Reflecting on this, first, I'm grateful to be able to be useful on such a large scale. After all, just ten years ago, I was a kid in Amman who'd just graduated from university and was interviewing at random companies (including a cigarette factory for VB6 work that comes with a free carton of cigarettes a week).</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, I think it's time to be more ambitious. With every project, I stopped short of what was possible. I let haters &amp; doubters change my plans and assumed a sense of fake humility because that's what people expected.</p>
<p>The culmination of my work is Replit, where we're working to give people computer superpowers. We want to nudge the world away from rampant digital consumption to one where there are more creators and entrepreneurs. Anyone anywhere can participate in the digital economy and build and leverage software to better themselves and their communities.</p>
<p>Now that I've seen what's possible in a decade while starting from nothing, in this decade, I'd like to create trillions of dollars in value for the world in the form of better access to technology and tools.</p>
<p>My only regret is my mum is not here to see all this. </p>

      <section itemprop="text">

        

        
<p>As part of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">YCW21</a>, <a href="http://dendron.so/">Dendron</a> was eligible for significant credits from all major cloud providers. This articles goes over my experience redeeming credits in two in particular: AWS and Google Cloud.</p>
<ul>
<li>DISCLAIMER: I used to work at AWS and have both conscious and unconscious biases towards my former employer 😅</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aws">AWS</h2>
<ul>
<li>reach out to dedicated YC email</li>
<li>response within an hour</li>
<li>scheduling a call a few days out
<ul>
<li>talked to AWS Startup Rep, a team comprised of former startup founders </li>
<li>talk about my use case and also got connected with team leads of folks in respective AWS services where I had questions</li>
<li>got all credits applied immediately after the call</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>access to AWS YC slack as well as free business support</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h2>
<ul>
<li>enroll in a google cloud for startup program</li>
<li>book an appointment with a sales rep 
<ul>
<li>sales rep wanted to know how much money I would spend with google cloud and repeatedly came back to that question (even though we were a pre-revenue startup with no pricing model at this point)</li>
<li>told rep about infrastructure we were thinking of using but they needed a dollar monthly amount since they were in sales and didn't have an understanding of the infrastructure</li>
<li>after some hypothetical numbers, got forwarded to a <em>google cloud partner</em>, a third party consulting firm that would help get me credits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>first available slot for partner was three weeks out</li>
<li>got a small chunk of google cloud credit with terms that more would be added if these credits ran out</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<ul>
<li>aws process
<ul>
<li>completed in under a week</li>
<li>got all credits and perks right away</li>
<li>access to first party support from AWS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>google process
<ul>
<li>process is still ongoing (its been three weeks now)</li>
<li>get credits in chunks and still not sure what the terms are and when they renew</li>
<li>first point of contact was a sales rep, now talking to a third party partner</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>We used to have a joke at Amazon that if someone didn't make it pass the interview loop, then they were once again <em>upgraded</em> to the position of a <strong>customer</strong>. While I personally loved my time there, it is awesome being at the other end of the customer obsessed machine. </p>
<p>As for google, I'm wondering at this point if I'll even get to talk to a google account manager. The initial onboarding call was entirely about how much money I was planning on spending with google (as opposed to the Amazon call where they wanted to help me architect my service). Google Cloud has really nice ergonomics and world class engineers but an awful reputation for customer support. My anecdotal experience seems to support this. </p>

									<p>The European Commission Wednesday <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_653" target="_blank">proposed to extend rules</a> for people to use mobile services in another European country without additional costs, known as "roaming," for 10 more years.</p>
<p>The EU <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/done-roaming-four-acts-no-heroes-plenty-of-pratfalls/">agreed</a> to scrap additional costs for roaming within the EU in 2017, effectively ending sky-high phone bills for people that used their mobile phone in another European country. The policy that was 13 years in the making and was heralded by the institutions as proof of the EU's value toward its citizens. </p>
<p>But the rules are due to expire in 2022. The Commission's proposal to extend the rules needs approval from national governments and the European Parliament, potentially leading to new hiccups in the coming year. </p>

<p>The new proposal also includes requirements to make sure people using mobile services in another European country are entitled to "the same quality and speed of their mobile network" at home, the Commission said.</p>

<h2>How to Build Your Own Death Star Operating System</h2>

<p>
  This tutorial will show you how to create your own headless operating
  system that runs on all the existing ones to.

</p><p>
  It's written as a textbook C program with a main() function that just
  prints a spinning deathstar. Cosmopolitan Libc makes this easy because
  linking this library causes GCC or Clang to build your program as
  an <a aria-label="Actually Portable Executable" title="Actually
  Portable Executable" href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">αcτµαlly pδrταblε
  εxεcµταblε</a> that runs on BIOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD,
  NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

</p>

<p>
  Watch the demo above to see proof that it works!

</p><h3>Source Build</h3>

<p>
  To reproduce the above demo on the Linux command prompt, all you need
  to do is run the following commands:

</p><pre>wget <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/deathstar.c">https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/deathstar.c</a>
wget <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.zip">https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.zip</a>
unzip -o cosmopolitan.zip
gcc -static -nostdlib -nostdinc -fno-pie -no-pie -mno-red-zone   \
    -o deathstar.com.dbg deathstar.c -fuse-ld=bfd -Wl,-T,ape.lds \
    -include cosmopolitan.h crt.o ape.o cosmopolitan.a
objcopy -S -O binary deathstar.com.dbg deathstar.com
./deathstar.com
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 16 -nographic -fda deathstar.com
</pre>

<p>
  Please note if you want to build the above program on Windows or MacOS
  then you need to install an x86_64-pc-linux-gnu toolchain beforehand.
  See the <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/windows-compiling.html">Compiling on Windows</a>
  tutorial.

</p><h3>Why it's Awesome</h3>

<p>
  Normally when programmers want to write a simple program and
  distribute it to a broad audience, they'll implement it using a
  scripting language like Python or Node, because C/C++ tooling has
  historically not been very good. The tradeoff is that scripting
  languages are slow and their APIs break frequently.

</p><p>
  Cosmopolitan Libc gives you native performance using C code that's so
  simple it feels like a scripting language. Why does it make C simple?
  You only need to compile your programs once. You don't need #include
  lines. You don't need time-wasting #ifdef soup with Cosmpolitan. The
  only API you need to care about is the standard POSIX one, so brush
  off your Richard W. Stevens books and prepare to have impact. You can
  even use fork() on Windows. And it's all permissively licensed too:
  not a single line of GPL or LGPL code went into this demo.

</p><p>
  In other words, Cosmopolitan puts power back in your hands because it
  obliterates the platform boundaries that've traditionally divided us.
  Cosmopolitan enables you to be more productive. Rather than put you in
  a sandbox it enables you to have all the ring0 privileges you want. Or
  if you prefer you can just run on conventional systems as an ordinary
  program. The point is that the choice is free and it's yours to make.

</p><p>
  Cosmopolitan is also unobtrusive. You might be thinking that if these
  binaries support so many environments then surely it must schlep in
  megabytes of bloated dependencies. That's totally not the case. All
  you need to get these benefits is 12kb of runtime code, explained
  further by this <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/howfat.html">previous tutorial</a>.

</p><h3>Why Has No One Thought of this Before?</h3>

<p>
  If it only takes 12kb of statically-linked runtime code to build
  binaries that run on everything, then how come no one's thought of
  this before? How could something like this be overlooked for so long?

</p><p>
  The answer is simple. Up until now, the only people who've been
  building C libraries are operating system vendors, who've never felt
  particularly motivated to devote the resources required to support
  their competitors.

</p><p>
  Cosmopolitan is an indie project that's intended to be a gift to any
  developer who might find it useful. If you think what you saw today is
  cool and would like to see more cool stuff like this in the future,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There is a large and ever-growing number of use cases for graph databases and many of them are centered around one important functionality: <strong>relationship traversals</strong>. While in traditional relational databases the concept of foreign keys seems like a simple and efficient idea, the truth is that they result in very complex joins and self-joins when the dataset becomes too inter-related.</p>
<p>Graph databases offer powerful data modeling and analysis capabilities for many real-world problems such as social networks, business relationships, dependencies, shipping, logistics… and they have been adopted by many of the world’s leading tech companies.</p>
<p>The use case you’ll be working on is <strong>Fraud Detection</strong> in large transaction networks. Usually, such networks contain millions of relationships between POS devices, logged transactions, and credit cards which makes it a perfect target for graph database algorithms.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a simple Python web application from scratch. You will get a basic understanding of the technologies that are used, and see how easy it is to integrate a graph database in your development process.</p>
<p>You can also find all of the code <a href="https://github.com/g-despot/card-fraud">here</a> if you don’t want to work on it as you go through the tutorial. If at any point in this tutorial you have a question or something is not working for you, feel free to post on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/memgraphdb">StackOverflow</a> with the tag <code>memgraphdb</code>.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Since you will be building a complete web application there is a number of tools that you will need to install before getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/">Flask</a></strong>: a very powerful web framework that provides you with tools, libraries and technologies used in web development. A Flask application can be as small as a single web page or as complex as a management interface.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker and Compose</a></strong>: an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your application from your infrastructure (host machine). If you are installing Docker on Windows, Compose will be already included. For Linux and macOS visit <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">this site</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/quick-start">Memgraph DB</a></strong>: a native fully distributed in-memory graph database built to handle real-time use-cases at enterprise scale. Follow the <a href="https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/getting-started/installation/docker-installation"><strong>Docker Installation</strong></a> instructions. While it’s completely optional, I encourage you to also install <strong><a href="https://memgraph.com/product/lab">Memgraph Lab</a></strong> so you can execute <strong>Cypher</strong> queries on the database directly and see visualized results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the Payment Fraud Detection Scenario</h2>
<p>First, let’s define all the roles in this scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Card</strong> - a credit card used for payment.</li>
<li><strong>POS</strong> - a point of sale device that uses a card to execute transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong> - a stored instance of buying something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your application will simulate how a POS device gets compromised, then a card in contact with that POS device gets compromised as well and in the end, a fraudulent transaction is reported.
Based on these reported transactions, Memgraph is used to search for the root-cause (a.k.a. the compromised POS) of the reported fraudulent transactions and all the cards that have fallen victim to it as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://public-assets.memgraph.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-card-fraud-detection-application-using-memgraph-flask-and-d3js/pos-graph.png" alt="Credit card fraud detection graph visualization"></p>
<p>Because this is a demo application you will create a set number of random cards, POS devices, and transactions. Some of these POS devices will be marked as compromised. If you find a compromised POS device, while searching for frauds in the network, then you’ll mark the card as compromised as well. If the card is compromised, there is a 0.1% chance the transaction is fraudulent and detected (regardless of the POS device). You can then visualize all the transactions and cards connected to that POS device and resolve them as not fraudulent if need be.</p>
<h2>Defining the Graph Schema</h2>
<p>After we defined the scenario, it’s time to create the graph schema!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A graph schema is a “dictionary” that defines the types of entities, vertices, and edges, in the graph and how those types of entities are related to one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so you know that there are three main entities in your model: <strong>Card</strong>, <strong>POS</strong> and <strong>Transaction</strong>.</p>
<p>The next step is to determine how these entities are represented in the graph and how they are connected. If you are not familiar with graph databases, a good rule of thumb is to use a relational analogy to get you started. All of these entities would be separate tables in a relational database and therefore they could be separate types of nodes in a graph. And so it is!
<img src="https://public-assets.memgraph.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-card-fraud-detection-application-using-memgraph-flask-and-d3js/graph-nodes.png" alt="Nodes"></p>
<p>Each type of node has a different label: <code>Card</code>, <code>Pos</code> and <code>Transaction</code>.
All of them have the property <code>id</code> so you can identify them. The nodes <code>Card</code> and <code>Pos</code> also have the boolean property <code>compromised</code> to indicate if fraudulent activity has taken place. The node <code>Transaction</code> has a similar boolean property with the name <code>fraudReported</code>.</p>
<p>But how are these nodes connected? The nodes labeled <code>Card</code> and <code>Transaction</code> are connected via a relationship of type <code>:USING</code>. Internalize the meaning by reading it out loud: a transaction is executed <em><strong>USING</strong></em> a card. In the same fashion, a transaction is executed <em><strong>AT</strong></em> a POS device so the relationship between <code>Transaction</code> and <code>POS</code> is of type <code>:AT</code>.</p>
<p>Using the Cypher query language notation, the data structure when there are no frauds looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>(:Card {compromised:false})&lt;-[:USING]-(:Transaction)-[:AT]-&gt;(:Pos {compromised: false})
</code></pre>
<p>The data structure when frauds occur:</p>
<pre><code>(:Card {compromised:true})&lt;-[:USING]-(:Transaction)-[:AT]-&gt;(:Pos {compromised: true})
(:Card {compromised:true})&lt;-[:USING]-(:Transaction {fraudReported:true})-[:AT]-&gt;(:Pos)
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://public-assets.memgraph.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-card-fraud-detection-application-using-memgraph-flask-and-d3js/graph-schema.png" alt="Credit Card Fraud Detection Graph schema"></p>
<h2>Building the Web Application Backbone</h2>
<p>This is presumably the easy part. You need to create a simple Python web application using Flask to be your server. Let’s start by creating a root directory for your project and naming it <code>card_fraud</code>. There you need to create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file containing the necessary PIP installs. For now, only one line is needed:</p>
<pre><code>Flask==1.1.2
</code></pre>
<p>You can install the specified package by running:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Add a new file to your root directory with the name <code>card_fraud.py</code> and the following code:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask
 
app = Flask(__name__)
 
 
@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def index():
   return "Hello World"
</code></pre>
<p>You are probably rolling your eyes while reading this, but don’t mock the <em><strong>Hello World</strong></em> example! Let’s compile and run your server to see if everything works as expected. Open a terminal, position yourself in the root directory and execute the following two commands:</p>
<pre><code>export FLASK_APP=card_fraud.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
</code></pre>
<p>This way, you have defined the entry point of your app and set the environment to <code>development</code>. This will enable development features like automatic code reloading. Don’t forget to change this to <code>production</code> when you’re ready to deploy your app. To run the server, execute:</p>
<pre><code>flask run --host 0.0.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>You should see a message similar to the following, indicating that your server is up and running:</p>
<pre><code>* Serving Flask app "card_fraud"
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
</code></pre>
<h2>Dockerizing the Application</h2>
<p>In the root directory of the project create two files, <code>Dockerfile</code> and <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. At the beginning of the <code>Dockerfile</code>, you specify the parent image and instruct the container to install CMake, mgclient, and pymgclient. CMake and mgclient are necessary to install pymgclient, the Python driver for Memgraph DB.</p>
<p>You don’t have to focus too much on this part, just copy the code to your <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span> python:<span>3.8</span>
 

<span>RUN</span><span> apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
  apt-get --yes install cmake</span>
 

<span>RUN</span><span> apt-get install -y git cmake make gcc g++ libssl-dev &amp;&amp; \
  git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/memgraph/mgclient.git /mgclient &amp;&amp; \
  <span>cd</span> mgclient &amp;&amp; \
  git checkout dd5dcaaed5d7c8b275fbfd5d2ecbfc5006fa5826 &amp;&amp; \
  mkdir build &amp;&amp; \
  <span>cd</span> build &amp;&amp; \
  cmake .. &amp;&amp; \
  make &amp;&amp; \
  make install</span>
 

<span>RUN</span><span> git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/memgraph/pymgclient /pymgclient &amp;&amp; \
  <span>cd</span> pymgclient &amp;&amp; \
  python3 setup.py build &amp;&amp; \
  python3 setup.py install</span>
 

<span>COPY</span><span> requirements.txt ./</span>
<span>RUN</span><span> pip3 install -r requirements.txt</span>
 
<span>COPY</span><span> card_fraud.py /app/card_fraud.py</span>
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app</span>
 
<span>ENV</span> FLASK_ENV=development
<span>ENV</span> LC_ALL=C.UTF-<span>8</span>
<span>ENV</span> LANG=C.UTF-<span>8</span>
 
<span>ENTRYPOINT</span><span> [<span>"python3"</span>, <span>"card_fraud.py"</span>]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not familiar with Docker, do yourself a favor and take look at this: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/">Getting started with Docker</a>.</p>
<p>Next, you need to create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. <strong>Compose</strong> is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. For this project, you’ll need two services. One is the web application (<code>sng_demo</code>) and the other a database instance (<code>memgraph</code>).</p>
<p>If you followed the instructions on <a href="https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/getting-started/installation/docker-installation">how to setup Memgraph DB with Docker</a> correctly you only need to add the following code to your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to run the container:</p>
<pre><code>version: "3"
services:
  memgraph:
    image: "memgraph"
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"
  card_fraud:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      MG_HOST: memgraph
      MG_PORT: 7687
    depends_on:
      - memgraph
</code></pre>
<p>When it comes to the <code>ports</code> key, there is an important distinction between the <strong>HOST_PORT</strong> and the <strong>CONTAINER_PORT</strong>. The first number in the key is the <strong>HOST_PORT</strong> and it can be used to connect from your host machine to the service (for example with <strong>Memgraph Lab</strong>).

<p><strong>Quick summary:</strong> A project is about to fail. Everybody feels it won’t meet the hard deadline. But the app ended up released on time and bug-free. How is that possible?</p>
<p>I want to tell you the real story behind <strong>an ambitious two-month project</strong> my team completed, with a huge impact on our organization. A very stressful, challenging, and full of surprises journey, marked by developers being the leaders. <strong>I intend to reveal why things went bad and how with a proper smart set of decisions the front-end team managed to navigate its boat</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-project"><a href="#the-project" aria-label="the project permalink"></a>The Project</h2>
<p>The project is intentionally interpreted mostly from a front-end perspective to avoid the risk of having a blurry presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Which parties were involved:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product owner (PO)</li>
<li>Front-end team (2 devs)</li>
<li>Backend team (2 devs)</li>
<li>QA team (2 testers)</li>
<li>UX/Designer</li>
<li>Content manager (translations)</li>
</ul>
<p>In total <strong>9 people</strong> from <strong>6 departments</strong> were allocated for this two-month effort (around 9 weeks). The UX design was done in advance, so it’s not included in the total duration.</p>
<h3 id="project-context"><a href="#project-context" aria-label="project context permalink"></a>Project Context</h3>
<p>Rapidly growing companies are usually investing in new hires and changes in the hierarchy structure. From all the <strong>9 people involved</strong>, 2 were <strong>new employees</strong> (PO and design), 2 had <strong>a year of experience</strong> in the organization, and from all <strong>6 teams</strong> 3 were <strong>newly formed</strong> while the rest were <strong>restructured</strong> to an extent. The <strong>newly formed</strong> UX team was extensively focused on the UIs in Figma  backed with translations delivered by a content manager who <strong>switched departments</strong>. On top of that building applications with a PO was <strong>new for us</strong> - these duties used to be fulfilled by a project manager in the past.</p>
<p>Where was I in the whole picture? You probably know the answer. Yes, I was too part of a <strong>newly formed web apps team</strong> of front-end developers. Up until this moment we were located in different cross-functional teams formed around specific long-term company products.</p>
<p>So many new, new, new.</p>
<p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic environment, new colleagues, new company structure. A  dangerous combination for ambitious projects with tight deadlines.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="project-goal"><a href="#project-goal" aria-label="project goal permalink"></a>Project Goal</h3>
<p>The purpose of the application was to allow customers <strong>easily find and operate</strong> on their subscription data, <strong>reducing, as a side effect, the number of related support tickets</strong> significantly.</p>
<p>To make things more complicated the project must account for all services, add-on products, and user edge cases dragged in over the years of product development.</p>
<h2 id="what-compromised-the-project-early-signs"><a href="#what-compromised-the-project-early-signs" aria-label="what compromised the project early signs permalink"></a>What Compromised the Project (Early Signs)</h2>
<p>Getting back from vacation I was immediately thrown into the process, having no idea what this new project is about. All planning and grooming sessions were already in the past, and teams were formed. At the same time, it was left to the individual parties to self-organize somehow and find their way in. I felt very uncomfortable and anxious: no information to start with, no initial setup, but probably the <strong>the most noticeable fact was the lack of clear leadership</strong>. To fill the gap <strong>many project management tasks got “naturally” assigned to the front-end team</strong> and from that point on required additional time for coordination.</p>
<p><strong>A quick side note:</strong> Often a project failure is determined by a few common factors. In one of his recent <a href="https://mailinglist.humanwhocodes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsletters</a> (<em>“Thoughts on mistakes”</em>) <a href="https://twitter.com/slicknet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicholas Zakas</a> grouped them like so: <strong>skills, luck</strong>, and <strong>hidden information</strong>. In such a combination they influence the outcome of a decision, but all of them apply to IT projects in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a few exceptions, you can control the amount of skill you bring into making a decision, and you can work to uncover hidden information (though sometimes it’s not obvious where to look), but luck is completely out of your control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting back to the story, and I have to admit, it was a <strong>minefield of hidden information</strong> popping up until the final release. All the skills required were present and even more of that. No unexpected event, call it luck if you want, has ever occurred. To uncover and deal with invisible use cases or wrong assumptions was the project’s most common bottleneck.</p>
<p>What prompted hidden information:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No clear leadership.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Not having a dedicated PM or a fully available project lead resulted in recurring distractions to handle organizational activities.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Lack of domain knowledge.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Not understanding the domain well enough — especially by new employees — is interconnected with the number of changes coming later in the development process. The higher the position, the worse.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Incomplete requirements.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Gaps in domain knowledge led to unclear or too narrow requirements driven by not actively involving people with good matter understanding in the planning stage.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Too many teams.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Having to coordinate six different teams would be a needless effort if people were otherwise grouped around the project in a single cross-functional unit.</p>
<p>All these implications didn’t give us up, of course, but <strong>forced (the front-end devs at least) to deliberately address problematic areas both code and management-wise</strong>.</p>
<p>But why should developers share the organizational burden, you may ask? Couldn’t you simply pass it down to the PO or someone from the upper management? After all, it is their job and you are just writing code, right? These are legit questions and we asked them ourselves many times, nevertheless the project ended up deliberately led by the dev team. <strong>We were developers in charge.</strong></p>
<h2 id="developers-in-charge"><a href="#developers-in-charge" aria-label="developers in charge permalink"></a>Developers in Charge</h2>
<p>The IT practice confirms whenever a team finds itself in a project storm, the best strategy is to <strong>allow experience developers to navigate the ship</strong>. This should go on until the process can be run in a normal temp with planning phases and iterations — in other words when the storm has already passed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extreme Programming (XP) was created in response to problem domains whose requirements change. Your customers may not have a firm idea of what the system should do. You may have a system whose functionality is expected to change every few months. In many software environments dynamically changing requirements is the only constant. This is when XP will succeed while other methodologies do not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote from <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/when.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when should XP be used</a> well describes the situation I was in at that moment. Our tech fellowship took the lead, because: <strong>we knew QA and backend devs well understand the domain, our front-end team can provide fast feedback loops, we are closer to the UI and flexible enough to allow for late changes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It was the right move.</strong> Situations like this should be considered extraordinary and avoided whenever possible, though. There is nothing better than working in a constant phase, doing what you do best, while PM handles the cross-team links. Everybody is on their seats and no huge surprises are to be expected. By saying this I also understand it’s largely wishful thinking. The harsh truth is <strong>most of the companies are not agile</strong> or don’t follow any structured methodology or apply frameworks like SCRUM or Kanban. I am a Kanban fan, but even <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/scrum-is-dead-all-hail-kanban-the-new-king-2cd6249feef8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its obvious benefits</a> are rarely enough to convince organizations to give it a try nowadays. Despite the endless sugary talks and big investments in agile frameworks like SCRUM fx., <strong>most of the companies rely on XP</strong> even if they don’t realize it. Developers’ responsibilities overlap with PM, marketing, SEO, design, etc., and that is not a coincidence.</p>

<h2 id="developers-strategy-to-deal-with-impediments"><a href="#developers-strategy-to-deal-with-impediments" aria-label="developers strategy to deal with impediments permalink"></a>Developers’ Strategy to Deal with Impediments</h2>
<p>We, in the front-end, built a flexible strategy to deal with project uncertainty, quickly realizing that great code alone won’t be enough for our success.</p>
<p>My colleagues are skilled people who rarely face technical challenges they can’t solve, while sporadic events (like the Covid-19 crisis) are very much unpredictable and difficult to prepare for. With this in mind, the strategy’s focus is put primarily on <strong>dealing with hidden information and minimizing its negative impact project-wise</strong>.</p>
<p>Once more, the four impediments:</p>
<ol>
<li>No clear leadership.</li>
<li>Lack of domain knowledge.</li>
<li>Incomplete requirements.</li>
<li>Too many teams.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solving each problem will eventually catalyze more data discoveries throughout the process, providing you, alongside, with handy tools to handle incoming change requests.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h3 id="no-clear-leadership"><a href="#no-clear-leadership" aria-label="no clear leadership permalink"></a>No Clear Leadership</h3>
<p>I decided to act proactively on this sudden project and conducted a <strong>kick-off meeting</strong> to organize everybody and build-up some confidence. The agenda was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project requirements</li>
<li>Duties between teams</li>
<li>Front-end tasks</li>
<li>Project repo and codebase</li>
<li>Communication channels</li>
<li>Split and estimation</li>
</ul>
<p>This was an opportunity to meet for the first time and get a feeling the project is finally moving. Further on <strong>regular sync meetings</strong> were set to discuss blockers, progress, or new information collected previously.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-domain-knowledge"><a href="#lack-of-domain-knowledge" aria-label="lack of domain knowledge permalink"></a>Lack of Domain Knowledge</h3>
<p>It became obvious the QA and backend teams best understand most of the underlying use cases. Two activities helped in this situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick short iterations and early releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deployments were performed daily so that QA and backend always had something usable to exercise on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent sync meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the place to discuss any new findings since the last release and to turn them into development tasks.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-requirements"><a href="#incomplete-requirements" aria-label="incomplete requirements permalink"></a>Incomplete Requirements</h3>
<p>Incomplete requirements are often “dressed” in a “final” UI design and are usually captured late when QA puts their hands on the front-end prototype. The following recipe was used to answer back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy incomplete prototypes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Releasing usable prototypes with fake backend and English texts to allow for a quick feedback loop is a good idea as often endpoints may not yet exist, translations and production-ready texts may also be in progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Break the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DRY principle</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DRY principle is of no use when working with frequently changing prerequisites where a <a href="https://overreacted.io/the-wet-codebase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WET codebase</a> will enable …</p></section></div>

                    <p>Over the years, company merchandise or, as the cool kids call them, swag (which stands for “stuff we all get”), especially from tech companies, has become something of a talking point and even a status symbol in some circles. </p><p>For some, it’s a status symbol to signal to others that you’re old school, you were around before <em>it all began</em>. As one <a href="https://qr.ae/pNjt1g">Quora user</a> pointed out, “what you really want is the swag from companies that looked impressive, but then died... You want that Enron keychain. You want the stuff that says, <em>I was there. I'm still here. They're not.</em> It makes a statement. ” </p><p>For others, it’s not about getting yet another Google water bottle or Facebook T-shirt. It’s about getting really useful stuff that’s durable, exclusive and memorable. That could be a <a href="https://qr.ae/pNjttJ">messenger bag from Quora</a>, a <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/what-happened-when-we-asked-200-companies-for-free-swag/">Tile from Airtable</a>, or <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/what-happened-when-we-asked-200-companies-for-free-swag/">an apron from Airbnb</a>. </p><p>According to <a href="https://swapnil.net/">Swapnil Agarwal</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://devswag.io/">DevSwag</a>, a site that curates opportunities for developers to collect swag, developers love swag because it helps them find their community. </p><blockquote><em>“For some developers, scoring swag feels like a badge of honor, achievement unlocked! They are more than happy to don a tee with a geeky quote or put a sticker on their laptop. This helps them project their preferences and find their tribe easily.” </em></blockquote><h3 id="why-do-companies-bother-with-swag"><strong>Why do companies bother with swag? </strong></h3><p>Companies invest in swag for various reasons. The most obvious one is to create hype and buzz around your brand. Did you know that one of the <a href="https://brightideaspromotional.co.uk/info/the-history-of-the-promotional-merchandise-industry/">earliest forms of swag</a> were the commemorative buttons produced to celebrate George Washington becoming the first President of the newly formed United States of America in 1789? It was 100 years later when two printers in Ohio, Jasper Meek and Henry Beach, realized that they could print advertisements on school bags, card cases and even horse hats, that the swag industry really began. </p><p>Since then, companies have been using swag to promote their brand, products and services. Think about those Slack socks, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/320447454657003520?lang=en">Tim Ferriss’ favorite Duolingo shirt</a>. The exposure those companies got from their swag, and still do to this day, is an investment that has definitely paid off. </p><p>Swag is also a good way to market to your own employees or show them your appreciation. It is also a great <a href="https://qz.com/work/1860082/employee-swag-is-a-remote-worker-culture-builder/">physical representation of a company's culture</a>. With the pandemic keeping people at home and employees working remotely, company swag offers that little bit of “connectedness” that we used to get from conversations around the coffee machine. &nbsp;</p><p>Companies are also using swag to incentivize people to contribute or engage with a brand or products. “Let's say (a company) wants to get beta users for a dev tool. It's far easier to get them with swag giveaways rather than traditional advertising,” says Swapnil.</p><p>Launched in 2018, <a href="https://devswag.io/">DevSwag</a> curates different opportunities available for developers to collect swag, and ranks the task difficulty for each opportunity. Tasks and rewards range from leaving a review for a podcast in exchange for stickers, to fixing a bug in exchange for a pair of socks. </p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/swapnil-agarwal-devswag-1.png"></figure><h3 id="who-s-giving-out-swag"><strong>Who’s giving out swag? </strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/asi-reports-2019-promo-sales-hit-high-of-25-8-billion-301010174.html">Advertising Speciality Institute</a> (ASI) reported that sales for company merchandise rose by 4.7% compared to 2018, &nbsp;reaching a record high of USD 25.8 billion in 2019. </p><p>At the height of the promotional products industry, the team at <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/what-happened-when-we-asked-200-companies-for-free-swag/">Kapwing</a> noticed that companies seemed to be giving out swag liberally and wanted to test out how common this was. So, they posed as college seniors “fan mailing” 201 companies asking if they could get some swag. </p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rGPMgvcTt4KKhIrcgICRVaaLcLqUBPx6ZDykvj2O426dHotfPZDHP7FBx9dMPLAI9YNP2DzBdetRrZsT6vnX3B2k0_nJ_mTpcKNCUzyfGNX7RxO50JckzK013wyzXDFZT74STRby"><figcaption>Source: Kapwing</figcaption></figure><p>Out of 201 companies, they successfully contacted 188 of them. They eventually received a response from 146 companies. Of those, they noted that B2C companies were more likely to respond than B2B companies, and B2C companies were more likely to offer swag than B2B companies. </p><p>Interestingly, tech or SaaS companies were the least likely to respond compared to other business types like apparel, beverage, and consumer goods. Their response rate was at 64% compared to other business types (82% to 87%). They also found that small to medium sized companies were more likely to give out company swag; these are companies with 11 to 49 employees, or companies with 50 to 249 employees respectively. </p><h3 id="is-swag-losing-its-swag"><strong>Is swag losing its <em>swag</em>?</strong> </h3><p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/03/patagonia-fleece-vest-tech-bro-uniform">Patagonia</a> decided to shift its sales program to only work with companies that meet certain social and environmental standards, or in their words “mission-driven companies that prioritize the planet”. &nbsp;The company now requires more information about the type of company “whose name will appear on the Patagonia product and how the product will be used. We reserve the right to refuse service.”</p><p>Just as companies are becoming more conscious about what their brands stand for, their swag, their suppliers and swag recipients are becoming increasingly integrated into the brand’s narrative. The public’s perception of a brand, especially those of global powerhouses like Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon, largely impact the swaggi-ness of a brand’s swag. </p><p>In January 2021, in light of Facebook banning former US President Donald Trump on social media, Facebook’s internal security team released a memo warning employees not to wear or carry Facebook-branded swag in public. As reported by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-warns-employees-not-to-wear-company-gear-in-pu-1846040220">Gizmodo</a>, “while the memo doesn’t appear to explicitly say Facebook employees are at risk of physical assault by Trump supporters, it’s easy to read between the lines”.</p><p>Public perception and public events also play a large role in the perceived swaggi-ness of a company. Just a week after Facebook’s memo, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-rebrands-storm-hill-event-capitol-violence-washington-dc-2021-1">Goldman Sachs</a>, had to quickly rebrand a virtual event they had organized to lobby Congress to help small businesses across America. The event that was originally called “Storm the Hill” definitely did not sit well with both organizers nor participants after what happened in Washington DC, and participants were urged not to wear the branded t-shirts that were mailed out to them prior.</p><p>Another factor that keeps swag cool and swaggy is its exclusivity. Slack’s socks, once exclusive, have now made their way to <a href="https://slack.shop/">Slack.shop</a>. Slack fans can now buy a pack of six pairs of socks for €49.80 along with a Slack t-shirt and a baby onesie. </p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/slack-socks-1.png"><figcaption>The exclusivity of Slack's socks are gone, but fans and aspiring employees can <em>almost</em> live the dream by purchasing them online.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-environmental-impact-of-swag"><strong>The environmental impact of swag</strong></h3><p>At the end of 2019, the Meeting, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE) industry was <a href="https://www.cwt-meetings-events.com/futuretrends/page/3/1">expected to grow by USD 840 billion (8%) in 2020</a> with 52% more event websites popping up compared to 2019. CWT Meetings and Events reported that companies were spending 25% to 30% of their overall marketing budgets on live events. </p><p>It is common for people to attend these conferences and collect as many tote bags, t-shirts, water bottles, usb sticks, pens, stress balls, stickers, notebooks, hats, rubber wrist bands, beer bottle openers, and everything else that can be made cheaply and quickly, with a company’s logo slapped on for swagginess. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90260185/its-time-to-stop-spending-billions-on-cheap-conference-swag">Elizabeth Segran</a> wrote, many of these companies’ merchandise aren’t well made or well designed, meaning that we’re likely to throw them out after just a handful of uses. </p><blockquote><em>“When you think about all the energy and resources that go into making just one of the tote bags that I have just thrown into the trash–only to end up in a landfill–the impact is staggering.”</em></blockquote><p>A quick Google search will show you that companies often compete over costs, but low costs comes at a high price for workers in countries like China, where most of these promotional products are made. By now, we’re aware of <a href="https://www.globalsources.com/NEWS/SIC-making-it-in-china-the-factory-workers-that-make-your-products.HTM">poor working conditions</a>, lack of safety standards, and very low wages. </p><p>This is why companies like Google have a vetted list of merchandise suppliers they work with—companies that sustainably source their materials and do not violate labour laws, meaning without child labour or inhumane working conditions. This could be the way forward for other companies who want to invest in company merchandise. </p><p>For Segran, the answer to both creating hype while reducing swag’s impact on the environment is to get rid of it entirely. As an alternative, she writes, “consider offering experiences. For instance, I’d appreciate a back massage at a conference, or perhaps a yoga class, or a free headshot. I’d even enjoy a good meal instead of a swag bag.” </p><p>She continues, “if you wrap the event in your branding, there’s a good chance your target customer will remember that experience long after the tote bag is stuffed in a landfill somewhere.”</p><h3 id="to-swag-or-not-to-swag"><strong>To swag or not to swag?</strong></h3><p>A quick browse of some HR groups on Facebook and LinkedIn uncover conversations where HR professionals are debating whether to give out company merchandise to employees over the recent year-end holidays, or if they should opt for gift cards as they’re a more “practical” way to support employees in this economic climate. Many rallied behind gift cards, especially the ever-versatile Visa gift cards, accepted nearly everywhere in the United States.</p><p>But if we’re real here, a multi-billion dollar industry is not going to disappear overnight or any time in the near future. In fact, ASI reported that while total swag sales dropped by 44% in Q2 2020, it had recovered about 20% of sales in Q3 2020 and a further 8% in Q4 2020. Total product sales for 2020 was USD 20.7 billion. </p><p>With the world going remote and people working from home, what swag did we spend all that money on? In 2020, it comes as no surprise that products like hand sanitizers contributed USD 1.4 billion in sales (7%), while other pandemic-related swag like branded cloth masks and other PPE made up USD 4.6 billion in sales (22%). </p><p>I believe that companies are becoming more intentional with the swag they give out. <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/thinking-outside-the-box-engaging-our-team-with-interactive-care-packages/">Duolingo</a>, for example, worked with <a href="https://www.swagup.com/">SwagUp</a> to create monthly “Interactive Care Packages” for employees during the pandemic to break up the monotony of staying at home.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div id="ron_db"><p>We are pleased to introduce <a href="https://www.rondb.com/" target="_blank">RonDB</a>, the world’s fastest key-value store with SQL capabilities, available now in the cloud. RonDB is an open source distribution of NDB Cluster, thus providing the same core technology and performance as NDB, but as a managed platform in the cloud. RonDB is the best low-latency, high throughput, and high availability database available today. In addition, it also brings large data storage capabilities. RonDB is a critical component of the infrastructure needed to build feature stores, and, in general, real-time applications.</p><h2>Introducing RonDB</h2><p>RonDB is an <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/rondb" target="_blank">open source</a> distribution of NDB Cluster which has been used as a key-value store for applications for almost 20 years. The name RonDB is a synthesis of its inventor, Mikael Ronström, and its heritage NDB. RonDB is offered as a managed version of NDB Cluster, providing the fastest solution targeting the traditional applications that use NDB Cluster such as those used in telecom, finance, and gaming. RonDB provides a solution as the data layer for operational AI applications. RonDB gives online models access to reliable, low-latency, high-throughput storage for precomputed features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>RonDB is ideal for developers who require a real-time database that can (1) be quickly deployed&nbsp; (RonDB provides a possibility to set up an RonDB cluster in less than a minute), (2) handle millions of database operations per second, and (3) be elastically scaled up and down to match the current load, reducing operational costs.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>What is a key-value store?</h2><p>A key-value store associates a value with a unique identifier (a key) to enable easy storage, retrieval, searching, and updating of data using simple queries - making them ideal for organisations with large volumes of data that needs to be constantly retrieved and updated.<br></p><p>Distributed key-value stores, such as RonDB, are optimal for organisations with heavy read/write workloads on large data sets, thus being a good fit for businesses operating at scale. For example, they are a critical component of the infrastructure needed to build feature stores and many different types&nbsp; of interactive and real-time applications.</p><h2>The value of RonDB</h2><h3>Key-value store applications</h3><p>RonDB can be used to develop interactive online applications where storing, retrieving and updating data is essential, but there is also the possibility to search for data in the same system. RonDB provides efficient access using a partition key through either native APIs or SQL access.&nbsp;<br></p><p>RonDB supports distributed transactions enabling applications to perform any type of data modification. RonDB enables concurrent complex queries using SQL as part of the online application. Through its efficient partitioning scheme, RonDB can scale nodes to support hundreds of CPUs per node and then scale to hundreds of data nodes (tens of thousands of CPUs in total).</p><h3>SQL applications</h3><p>RonDB supports writing low latency, high availability SQL applications using its full SQL capabilities, providing a MySQL Server API.</p><h2>LATS: low Latency, high Availability, high Throughput, and scalable Storage</h2><p>RonDB is the fastest key-value store currently available and the only one with general purpose query capabilities, through its SQL support. The performance of key-value stores are evaluated based on low Latency, high Availability, high Throughput, and scalable Storage (LATS).&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/60364af8c8f5d47b1f1f70ce_graph_white.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="http://www.irondb.com/"><strong>LATS</strong>: low <strong>L</strong>atency, high <strong>A</strong>vailability, high <strong>T</strong>hroughput, scalable <strong>S</strong>torage.</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Low Latency</h3><p>RonDB has shown the fastest response times: it can respond in 100-200 microseconds on individual requests and in less than a millisecond on batched read requests; it can also perform complex transactions in a highly loaded cluster within 10 milliseconds. Moreover, and perhaps even more importantly, RonDB has predictable latency.</p><h3>High Availability</h3><p>NDB Cluster can provide <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/mikaelronstrom/ndb-cluster-80requirements">Class 6 Availability</a>; in other words, an NDB system is operational 99.9999% of the time, thus <strong>no more than 30 seconds of downtime per year</strong>. RonDB brings the same type of availability now to the cloud, thus <strong>ensuring that RonDB is always available</strong>. RonDB allows you to place replicas within a cloud region on different availability zones, ensuring that failure of availability zones does not result in downtime for RonDB.</p><h3>High Throughput</h3><p>RonDB scales to up to hundreds of millions of read or write ops/seconds. A single RonDB instance on a virtual machine can support millions of key value operations per second,&nbsp; and, without downtime, can be scaled up&nbsp; to a large cluster that supports hundreds of millions of key value operations per second.</p><h3>Scalable Storage</h3><p>RonDB offers large dataset capabilities, being able to store up to petabytes of data.Individual RonDB data nodes can store up to 16TBytes of in-memory data and many tens of TBytes of disk data. Given that RonDB clusters can scale up to 144 data nodes, an RonDB cluster can be scaled to store petabytes of data.</p><h3>LATS Performance</h3><p>The combination of predictable low latency, the ability to handle millions of operations per second, and a unique high availability solution makes RonDB the leading LATS database, that is now also available in the cloud.</p><h2>RonDB as online feature stores</h2><p>RonDB is the foundation of the <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/utm_source=rondb">Hopsworks Online Feature Store</a>. For those unfamiliar with the concept of feature store, it is a data warehouse of features for machine learning. It contains two databases: an online database serving features at low latency to online applications and an offline database storing large volumes of historic feature values.&nbsp;</p><p>The online feature store provides the data (features) that underlie the models used in intelligent online applications. For example, it helps inform an intelligent decision about whether a financial transaction is suspected of money laundering or not by providing the real-time information about the user’s credit history, recent card usage, location of the transaction, and so on. Thus, the most important requirements from the feature store are quick and consistent responses (low latency), handling large volumes of key lookups (high throughput), and being always available (high availability). In addition an online feature store should be able to scale as the business grows. RonDB is the only database available in the market that meets all these requirements.<br></p><h2>Get Started</h2><p>We’re not releasing RonDB publicly just yet. Instead, we have made it available as early access. If you think your team could benefit from RonDB, <a href="https://www.rondb.com/">please contact us</a>!<br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><span>This is a&nbsp;sponsored post. The&nbsp;text is mine</span></p>
<p>Recently, I’ve written <a href="https://robertblinov.net/blog/all/immune-to-cancel-culture/">a&nbsp;manifesto about being immune to&nbsp;cancel culture</a>. Understanding the&nbsp;gloomy reality, I decided to&nbsp;stop it from affecting me.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;today’s centralised web, the&nbsp;only sure way to&nbsp;avoid being deplatformed is to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;server at&nbsp;home, something that may not&nbsp;always be possible to&nbsp;do. Searching for&nbsp;other ways to&nbsp;resist external restrictions, I found out about Stacks, a&nbsp;network that creates a&nbsp;financial incentive to&nbsp;decentralise the&nbsp;web. Just like miners are paid a&nbsp;fee for&nbsp;running bitcoin nodes, Stackers are paid a&nbsp;fee to&nbsp;run Stacks.</p>
<p>Stacks is versatile: it can be used to&nbsp;run websites with the&nbsp;decentralised storage system Gaia, but&nbsp;also to&nbsp;place smart contracts such as&nbsp;paid subscriptions, auctions, and&nbsp;access control.</p>
<p>It’s time to&nbsp;start transitioning to&nbsp;the&nbsp;decentralised Web 3.0. <a href="https://stacks.co/">Learn&nbsp;more on&nbsp;Stacks.co</a></p>

Sean Moriarity and I are glad to announce that the project we have been working on for the last 3 months, Nx, is finally <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx">publicly available on GitHub</a>. Our goal with Nx is to provide the foundation for Numerical Elixir.</p>
<p>
In this blog post, I am going to outline the work we have done so far, some of the design decisions, and what we are planning to explore next. If you are looking for other resources to learn about Nx, you can <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/034-jose-valim-reveals-project-nx/">hear me unveiling Nx on the ThinkingElixir podcast</a>.</p>

Nx is a multi-dimensional tensors library for Elixir with multi-staged compilation to the CPU/GPU. Let’s see an example:</p>

The high-level features in Nx are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
Typed multi-dimensional tensors, where the tensors can be unsigned integers (<code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>), signed integers (<code>s8</code>, <code>s16</code>, <code>s32</code>, <code>s64</code>), floats (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>) and brain floats (<code>bf16</code>);    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor">Named tensors</a>, allowing developers to give names to each dimension, leading to more readable and less error prone codebases;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Automatic differentiation, also known as autograd. The <code>grad</code> function provides reverse-mode differentiation, useful for simulations, training probabilistic models, etc;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Tensors backends, which enables the main <code>Nx</code> API to be used to manipulate binary tensors, GPU-backed tensors, sparse matrices, and more;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Numerical definitions, known as <code>defn</code>, provide multi-stage compilation of tensor operations to multiple targets, such as highly specialized CPU code or the GPU. The compilation can happen either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT) with a compiler of your choice;    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For Python developers, <code>Nx</code> currently takes its main inspirations from <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code>Numpy</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax"><code>JAX</code></a> but packaged into a single unified library.</p>
<p>
Our initial efforts have focused on the underlying abstractions. For example, while Nx implements dense tensors out-of-the-box, we also want the same high-level API to be valid for sparse tensors. You should also be able to use all functions in the <code>Nx</code> module with tensors that are backed by Elixir binaries and with tensors that are stored directly in the GPU.</p>
<p>
By ensuring the underlying tensor backend is ultimately replaceable, we can build an ecosystem of libraries on top of Nx, and allow end-users to experiment with different backends, hardware, and approaches to run their software on.</p>
<p>
<em>Nx’s mascot is the Numbat, a marsupial native to southern Australia. Unfortunately the Numbat are endangered and it is estimated to be fewer than 1000 left. If you are excited about Nx, consider donating to Numbat conservation efforts, such as <a href="https://www.numbat.org.au/">Project Numbat</a> and <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/">Australian Wildlife Conservancy</a>.</em></p>
<h2>
Numerical definitions</h2>
<p>
One of the most important features in <code>Nx</code> is the numerical definition, called <code>defn</code>. Numerical definitions are a subset of Elixir tailored for numerical computing. Here is the <code>softmax</code> formula above, now written with <code>defn</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Formula</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-3">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The first difference we see with <code>defn</code> is that Elixir’s built-in operators have been augmented to also work with tensors. Effectively, <code>defn</code> replaces Elixir’s <code>Kernel</code> with <code>Nx.Defn.Kernel</code>.</p>
<p>
However, <code>defn</code> goes even further. When using <code>defn</code>, <code>Nx</code> builds a computation with all of your tensor operations. Let’s inspect it:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0485630283-2">do</span><span>

This computation graph can also be transformed programatically. The transformation is precisely how we implement automatic differentiation, also known as <code>autograd</code>, by traversing each node and computing their derivative:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>grad_softmax</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Finally, this computation graph can also be handed out to different compilers. As an example, we have implemented bindings for <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/">Google’s XLA</a> compiler, called EXLA. We can ask the <code>softmax</code> function to use this new compiler with a module attribute:</p>
<pre><code><span>@defn_compiler</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">{</span><span>EXLA</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>client</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:host</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">}</span><span>

  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">)</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Once <code>softmax</code> is called, <code>Nx.Defn</code> will invoke <code>EXLA</code> to emit a just-in-time and highly-specialized compiled version of the code, tailored to the tensor type and shape. By passing <code>client: :cuda</code> or <code>client: :rocm</code>, the code can be compiled for the GPU. For reference, here are some benchmarks of the function above when called with a tensor of one million random float values on different clients:</p>

Where <code>keep</code> indicates the tensor was kept on the device instead of being transferred back to Elixir. You can see the benchmark in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/bench"><code>bench</code></a> directory and find some examples in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/examples"><code>examples</code></a> directory of the EXLA project.</p>
<h3>
Compiling numerical definitions</h3>
<p>
Before moving forward, it is important for us to take a look at how numerical definitions are compiled. For example, take the <code>softmax</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">)</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
One might think that Elixir takes the AST of the softmax function above and compiles it directly to the GPU. However, that’s not the case! Numerical definitions are first compiled to Elixir code that will emit the computation graph and this computation graph is then compiled to the GPU. The multiple stages go like this:</p>
<pre><code>Elixir AST
-&gt; compiles to .beam (Erlang VM bytecode)
   -&gt; executes into defn AST
      -&gt; compiles to GPU</code></pre>
<p>
This multi-stage programming is made possible thanks to Elixir macros. For example, when you see a conditional inside <code>defn</code>, that conditional looks exactly like Elixir conditionals, but it will be compiled to an accelerator:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">do</span><span>
    </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">else</span><span>
    </span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In a nutshell, <code>defn</code> provides us with a subset of Elixir for numerical computations that can be compiled to specific hardware, such as CPU, GPU, and other accelerators. All of this was possible without making changes or forking the language.</p>
<p>
And while <code>defn</code> is a subset of the language, it is a considerable one. You will find support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Mathematical operators  </li>
  <li>
Pipes (<code>|&gt;</code>), module attributes, the access syntax (i.e. <code>tensor[1][1..-1]</code>), etc  </li>
  <li>
Elixir macros constructs (imports, aliases, etc)  </li>
  <li>
Control-flow with conditionals (both <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code>), loops (coming soon), etc  </li>
  <li>
Transformations, an explicit mechanism to invoke Elixir code from a <code>defn</code> (which enables constructs such as <code>grad</code>)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
And more coming down the road.</p>
<h2>
Why functional programming?</h2>
<p>
At this point, you may be wondering: is functional programming a good fit for numerical computing? One of the main concerns is that immutability can be expensive when working with large blobs of memory. And that’s a valid concern! In fact, when using the default tensor backend, tensors will be backed by Elixir binaries which are copied on every operation. That’s why it was critical for us to design <code>Nx</code> with pluggable backends from day one.</p>
<p>
However, as we move to higher-level abstractions, such as numerical definitions, we will start to reap the benefits of functional programming.</p>
<p>
For example, in order to build computation graphs, immutability becomes an indispensable tool both in terms of implementation and reasoning. The JAX library for Python, which has been one of the guiding lights for Nx design, also promotes functional and immutable principles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>JAX is intended to be used with a functional style of programming</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.ops.html?highlight=functional#indexed-update-operators">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>Unlike NumPy arrays, JAX arrays are always immutable</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html?highlight=immutable#JAX-vs.-NumPy">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, frameworks like <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc.ai</a> argue that functional programming can provide better abstractions and more composable building blocks for deep learning libraries.</p>
<p>
We hope that, by exploring these concepts in a language that is functional by design, Elixir can bring new ideas and insights at the higher-level.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RabbitMQ and Google Pub/Sub are both powerful and reliable message queue implementations, and if you need to pick one of them for your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, the choice may not be simple. We recently started a new project that required a message broker integrated into the solution, and although there are several choices on the market, we quickly narrowed down our options to these two products. This blog post is the first part of the summary of our analysis.</p><p>The project in question — an apartment rental platform for Swiss clients — had to meet both scalability and geographically restricted hosting requirements. When we began, GCP was the most viable option for meeting these requirements. However, the technology was new to us, which meant we needed to reconsider some of our technology choices.</p><p>In this new software, some of our services were going to communicate via message queues, which meant we also needed to choose a message queue implementation that could be deployed to GCP. Additionally, it was important that we decided on something reliable.</p><p>In a non-GCP project, RabbitMQ would be the preferred choice because it’s well-known among our team, it has a convenient administrative interface, it has extensively configurable message distribution and routing, and most importantly, its documentation is well-maintained and thorough.</p><p>However, RabbitMQ is not a native building block of the GCP infrastructure — we can still install it fairly easily from the GCP Marketplace as a Click to Deploy container, but as a custom install, there’s no service-level agreement (SLA) for it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pub/Sub is GCP’s native implementation for message queues. We hadn’t used it before, but after a quick look at the official developer documentation, our first impressions were positive. Setting up queues requires just a few clicks, and there’s documentation with examples of how to use the queues with some widely used programming languages.</p><p>Let’s explore the benefits of each solution and see how easy it is to build up a queue topology with RabbitMQ and Pub/Sub.</p><p>The general idea of a message broker is to relay messages from publishers to consumers by routing them to different delivery queues. So, we’ll first look at the basic building blocks of RabbitMQ and Pub/Sub to see how much they differ from one another.</p><figure><img src="https://engineering.3ap.ch/message-broker-generic.svg" alt="publishers routing logic queues consumers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The idea of a message broker</figcaption></figure><p><em>RabbitMQ</em> is an open source message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) standard, and with its various plugins, it also supports other protocols, including Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) and MQ Telemetry Transport. In this post, we’ll focus on RabbitMQ’s AMQP features.</p><p>In RabbitMQ, the topology is built up from <strong>exchanges</strong> and <strong>queues</strong> that are connected by <strong>bindings</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engineering.3ap.ch/rabbitmq-broker.svg" alt="publishers exchanges bindings queues consumers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The RabbitMQ broker building blocks</figcaption></figure><h2 id="exchanges">Exchanges</h2><p>Exchanges make it possible to define the routing of messages to queues connected to the exchange. Message publishers have to send their messages to exchanges, and from there, they’re routed to queues.</p><p>Exchanges can be created on demand by the publisher or the consumer, and they must be declared with a name and a type. The table below shows the four possible types of exchanges, along with their behaviors:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Exchange Type</th><th>Behavior</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Direct</td><td>The message goes to the queues with a binding key that matches the routing key of the message exactly.</td></tr><tr><td>Topic</td><td>This routes messages to queues based on a wildcard match between the routing key and the routing pattern.</td></tr><tr><td>Headers</td><td>These are similar to Topic exchanges, but they use headers and optional values for routing.</td></tr><tr><td>Fanout</td><td>This broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues it knows. Routing keys are ignored.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In a <em>topic exchange</em>, wildcards can be used for defining bindings based on routing keys.</p><p>Let’s suppose our broker propagates messages with routing keys following this structure: <code>transaction.&lt;product&gt;.&lt;city&gt;.&lt;productcode&gt;</code> — for example, <code>transaction.stock.london.ABC</code>, <code>transaction.bond.frankfurt.DEF</code>, and <code>transaction.stock.newyork.JKL</code>. We can define the following kinds of binding rules for such routing keys:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Binding Rule</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>transaction.stock.london.#</code></td><td>Matches any routing key starting with <code>transaction.stock.london.</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>transaction.*.london.#</code></td><td>Matches routing keys starting with <code>transaction</code>, then with any string as the second element, followed by <code>london</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>With <em>header exchanges</em>, you can specify matching rules for header attribute values.</p><p>Let’s suppose all our messages have a <code>format</code> and a <code>type</code> header attribute and they look like <code>{format = jpg, type = profilephoto}</code>, <code>{format = pdf, type = workpermit}</code>, or <code>{format = jpg, type = workpermit}</code>. The header exchange may define conjunctive and disjunctive binding rules by listing headers with their expected values, such as:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Binding Rule</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>{format = jpg, type = workpermit, x-match = all}</code></td><td>Matches messages with the arguments <code>format = jpg</code> AND <code>type = workpermit</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>{format = jpg, type = profilephoto, x-match = any}</code></td><td>Matches messages with the argument <code>format = jpg</code> OR <code>type = profilephoto</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>By default, every RabbitMQ broker installation comes with a set of <em>predeclared exchanges</em> for each exchange type:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Exchange Type</th><th>Default Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Direct</td><td><code>amq.direct</code> or empty string</td></tr><tr><td>Topic</td><td><code>amq.topic</code></td></tr><tr><td>Headers</td><td><code>amq.headers</code> (and the AMQP standard <code>amq.match</code>)</td></tr><tr><td>Fanout</td><td><code>amq.fanout</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <em>default exchange</em> is the direct exchange with no name (empty string). It has a useful feature that comes in handy for simple applications: Every queue that’s created is bound to this direct exchange with a routing key that’s the same as the queue name.</p><p>In addition to types, exchanges have some other important features, outlined below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Durability</td><td>Durable exchanges survive broker restarts, while transient ones don’t.</td></tr><tr><td>Auto-delete</td><td>An exchange can be deleted automatically as soon as the last queue is unbound from it.</td></tr><tr><td>Internal</td><td>This specifies whether or not the exchange is reserved for internal use by the broker only.</td></tr><tr><td>Arguments</td><td>This is a user-definable attribute list where the values can be of type string, list, number, or Boolean. A reserved argument name is <code>alternate-exchange</code>.</td></tr><tr><td>Alternate exchange</td><td>If the routing of messages isn’t possible via any of the bindings, messages will be sent to the alternate exchange if specified.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="queues">Queues</h2><p>Queues are named resources that store messages consumed by applications. Some important attributes (or arguments, as they’re referred to in RabbitMQ) are outlined below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>x-max-priority</code></td><td>If this is set, the queue can handle message priorities.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-message-ttl</code></td><td>After the TTL period expires, the message will be discarded from the queue.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-expires</code></td><td>If the queue remains unused for the specified period, it’ll automatically be deleted.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-max-length</code></td><td>This is the maximum number of messages in the queue.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-max-length-bytes</code></td><td>This is the total body size of messages a queue can contain.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-overflow</code></td><td>This specifies what should happen with messages if the queue is full. It can start dropping the oldest or the newest messages or republish the newest ones to the dead letter queue.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-dead-letter-exchange</code></td><td>This is an optional dead letter exchange.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-dead-letter-routing-key</code></td><td>The routing key of dead-lettered messages can be optionally replaced.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-queue-mode</code></td><td>If this is set to <code>lazy</code>, all the messages are written to disk. This causes some performance degradation, but it eliminates unexpected glitches in performance.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Consumers get messages from the queues using a push or a pull mechanism. Push-style delivery happens via consumer channels that should be registered by the consumer application with a <code>basic.consume</code> request. When the broker pushes a message to the consumer (<code>basic.deliver</code>), the consumer has to acknowledge the receipt. This acknowledgement can be positive (<code>basic.ack</code>), negative (<code>basic.nack</code>), or a rejection (<code>basic.reject</code>). The broker doesn’t remove the message from the queue until it gets some kind of acknowledgement. Depending on the acknowledgement type, the message can be deleted, requeued, or rerouted.</p><p>The consumer can be registered in auto-acknowledgement mode, but it’s quite risky, because in this case, the queue automatically removes the message from the queue once it’s been pushed to the consumer, and it doesn’t wait for any processing acknowledgement (meaning that if the consumer dies, the message gets lost).</p><p>The other possibility for the consumer is to poll the queues directly by using <code>basic.get</code> requests. This is expensive compared to push-style delivery, because the consumer has to both repeatedly check if there are new messages in the queue and wait for a response.</p><h2 id="dead-letter-exchanges">Dead Letter Exchanges</h2><p>We can use dead letter exchanges to catch messages that weren’t processed by the consumer for some reason. Messages can be republished to a dead letter exchange if:</p><ul><li>The message was negatively acknowledged (<code>basic.nack</code> or <code>basic.reject</code>).</li><li>The message expired due to its TTL.</li><li>The message was dropped because its queue is over the length limit.</li></ul><h2 id="rabbitmq-messages">RabbitMQ Messages</h2><p>A message consists of the message body and additional attributes (some of them are known as headers). Some predefined attributes include:</p><ul><li>Content type</li><li>Encoding</li><li>Routing key</li><li>Delivery mode (persistent or not)</li><li>Priority (effective only on queues that have priorities enabled)</li><li>Publishing timestamp</li><li>Expiration period</li><li>Publisher application ID</li></ul><h2 id="sending-a-message-with-rabbitmq">Sending a Message with RabbitMQ</h2><p>Messages have to be published to exchanges, and the exchanges route them to the queues. When sending a message, the publisher has to specify the routing key and the exchange name. If the exchange name is specified as an empty string, the message is directly routed to the queue that has the same name as its routing key (see the explanation of default exchanges in the <a href="#exchanges">Exchanges section above</a>
).</p><p>Pub/Sub is Google’s message broker implementation. It’s a native building block of the Google Cloud infrastructure and can be used exclusively in Google Cloud. We only have to enable the Pub/Sub Services in our GCP project, and then we can start integrating our application with this service.</p><p>In Pub/Sub, we can build our queue topology from <strong>topics</strong> and <strong>subscriptions</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engineering.3ap.ch/pubsub-broker.svg" alt="publishers topics subscriptions consumers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Pub/Sub broker building blocks</figcaption></figure><h2 id="topics">Topics</h2><p>Topics…</p></div></div>

However, there are multiple <strong>challenges</strong> in succeeding with Spark:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Spark has a <strong>high learning curve</strong>, and is not accessible to many of the users in an organization.

Then there are data analysts, machine learning engineers, metadata architects who all need to access and process the same data.</li><li><strong>Code quality</strong> is the next issue. As users start building workflows (or moving them from legacy ETL products such as Informatica or AbInitio), they are learning Spark while writing lots of Spark code.

        <div><p>This generation of tweens and teens has grown up online, and it’s where they go to learn, laugh, and connect. Every family has a different approach to how they use technology, access the internet and set digital ground rules. Over the years, we’ve made investments to protect families and kids on YouTube, such as launching a dedicated <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-kids/">kids app</a>, better protecting their <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-on-kids/">privacy</a>, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-on-our-efforts-to-protect/">restricting features</a> and improving <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/using-technology-more-consistently-apply-age-restrictions/">age restrictions</a>. Today, we are announcing a <a href="http://youtube.com/myfamily">new choice</a> for parents who have decided their tweens and teens are ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div><h2>Supervised experiences on YouTube</h2><p>From our earliest days, YouTube has been a platform for people <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409">over 13</a>, and we’ve always recommended that parents co-watch with their kids if they choose to watch YouTube. In 2015, we created <a href="https://kids.youtube.com/">YouTube Kids</a>, a safer destination for kids to explore their interests while providing parental controls. But since then, we’ve heard from parents and older children that tweens and teens have different needs, which weren’t being fully met by our products. As children grow up, they have insatiable curiosity and need to gain independence and find new ways to learn, create, and belong.</p></div>

        <div><p>Over the last year, we've worked with parents and experts across the globe in areas related to child safety, child development, and digital literacy to develop a solution for parents of tweens and teens. In the coming months, we’ll launch a new experience in beta for parents to allow their children to access YouTube through a <a href="https://support.google.com/families/answer/7103338?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7336731">supervised Google Account</a>. This <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10314940">supervised experience</a> will come with content settings and limited features. We’ll start with an early beta for families with kids under the <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409">age of consent</a> to test and provide feedback, as we continue to expand and improve the experience.&nbsp;</p></div>

At launch, we'll also disable in-app purchases, as well as creation and comments features.

We’ll continue <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubekids/thread/49349707?hl=en">expanding product availability</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/12980033?hl=en">adding new features</a>, and offering several new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kids/parent-resources/">parental tools</a>, such as a highly-requested option for parents to select specific videos and channels from the main YouTube platform that they’d like their child to explore on YouTube Kids.</p><p>We know that we have a long journey ahead of us as we design this experience for parents of tweens and teens. Over the long term, we hope this will provide a safer environment for older children to explore their interests, learn new skills, connect with communities that share their passions, while giving parents more ways to support their kids' online experience.<br></p></div>

                            <h3>How we got to this decision and what we got out of it.<br></h3>
                            <div><p>We develop our main product, the Cranmera MPC engine, in C++20. (Why we chose Modern C++ and not, for example, Rust, is a topic for another blogpost.)&nbsp;Because&nbsp;C++ doesn’t come with a default build system like Rust’s Cargo, it&nbsp;means that it is up to the programmer to choose an appropriate build&nbsp;system.&nbsp;(Strictly speaking, I should say ‘build system generator’, as&nbsp;Ninja is the actual build system that we use, but let’s not get into that today.)</p><p>This choice is of course not just a disadvantage; in that you actually have a choice. As CMake is quite popular in the C++ community these days, I had been using CMake for several years now. (And before that I used GNU’s Automake.) Anyway, in the beginning, I was satisfied with my choice for CMake, although I never had the feeling that I really mastered CMake.</p></div>
                            <h4>"I want to have that ultimate control also over my build system"<br></h4>
                            <div><p>In my previous role as academic researcher, I mainly wrote scientific code for which the build system played a minor role. I&nbsp;liked to view the build system as a part that you ‘mess around with it&nbsp;until it works, and then keep your hands off it’, which served my&nbsp;purpose well enough at the time. Now that I have the role of CTO in a&nbsp;privacy-technology company, I bear much more responsibility for the&nbsp;quality and robustness of the developed codebase.</p><p>Even before you have to choose a build system, there is the choice of&nbsp;the programming language for a new project. In a nutshell: choose the right tool given the problem. For us, that choice happens to be C++, which gives us ultimate control. (There is a price to pay for this level of control, namely that you become responsible for managing all resources within the program, and for protecting yourself against the footguns that any language with low-level features happily offers you. </p><p>The purpose of having all that control is that it should ultimately pay off in terms of better performance: smaller memory footprint, faster code, etc., though it comes with the price of extra cognitive load during development.)<br>I want to have that ultimate control also over my build system, but as I already indicated above, with CMake it never felt like having that level of control.</p></div>
                            <h4>Coming from CMake<br></h4>
                            <div><p>Recently,&nbsp;we have migrated from CMake to Meson, and in the rest of this blogpost I&nbsp;want to tell the story of how we got to this decision and what we got out of it. </p><p>The&nbsp;main reason for migrating our build system, is that I wanted to prevent&nbsp;the scenario where some parts of the codebase, of which you actually know that those are a bit messy (in this case, our CMake scripts), suddenly start playing up at a very bad moment, for example just before&nbsp;the deadline of shipping a new product. </p><p>If&nbsp;you have some engineering experience, you will agree that the more subtle kind of technical problems like to manifest themselves in&nbsp;atypical situations or corner cases. What I mean, in terms of a build system, is that you won’t notice the actual quality of your build system&nbsp;scripts until you start doing special things, like porting to other&nbsp;OSes, architectures and cross-compiling. At that point you will be penalized for every ‘hack’, where you did not follow the idiom prescribed by the makers of the (build) system. And where are those&nbsp;hacks actually located? In your own build scripts, or in the “FindXXX.cmake” scripts you found somewhere on GitHub? </p></div>
                            <h4>Modern CMake<br></h4>
                            <div><p>Then there is the topic of “Modern CMake”, caused by the paradigm shift that&nbsp;took place a few years ago in CMake, due to which we now have the “old”&nbsp;(read: “wrong”) directory-based style, versus the “modern” (and recommended) target-based style. “Modern CMake” is probably coined to make us think of “Modern C++”, the latter being the novel style of C++ that encourages the use of updated and less error-prone language and standard-library constructs.&nbsp;<br>With respect to the language C++, I value the backwards compatibility guarantees that C++ offers, and I agree that those backwards-compatibility benefits make up for the ugly parts of its syntax. With respect to a build system, however, I am not convinced of the value of such backwards compatibility, and in my opinion, a clean syntax and well-thought-out structure is much to be preferred.&nbsp;</p><p>By the way, googling for “modern CMake” yields quite many blog posts in which authors explain the intricacies of Modern CMake. One could view the abundance of such stories as a positive thing, though I can’t help regarding it as an indicator for the poor style of CMake’s own documentation. Compared to that, Meson’s documentation, together with its design, simply feels ‘right’.&nbsp;</p><p>Before deciding to switch our build system, I have tried to convert our CMake scripts to the “Modern CMake” idiom and polish them up. After putting some work in it, meaning reading CMake docs and changing scripts, I was still not satisfied with the result. Probably it was my own fault; I still did not yet fully understand CMake’s new idioms, and as a consequence our build system setup still felt brittle. On the other hand, given that our build system requirements are not that complex, why&nbsp;should I invest more time to become an expert in a system (CMake) that I anyway appreciate less the more I read about it... What about&nbsp;alternatives?&nbsp;</p></div>
                            <h4>Choosing Meson<br></h4>
                            <div><p>Before choosing Meson, I also considered build2 by Boris Kolpackov / Code Synthesis. Build2 is famous for being one of the earliest build systems&nbsp;to support C++20 Modules, and based on its descriptions and the author’s&nbsp;talks (e.g. at CPPCon) this system seems to be well-designed, more&nbsp;advanced than most other build systems, and to have a lot of potential. However, given my limited amount of time, I was unable to quickly figure&nbsp;out from its documentation how I could accomplish common tasks, like linking with libs that are not included in the related cppget.org repository, such as Boost. I think improving documentation-for-the-impatient is something where Build2 could improve.&nbsp;BTW, I am curious to see how Meson’s approach to dealing with C++20&nbsp;modules will develop; we do not yet use them in our project.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not want claim that our build system requirements are very complex, though we do need some special setup:&nbsp;<br>- we need multi-compiler support (Clang for debug and GCC for release builds);<br>- depending on the use of Address Sanitizer, or Valgrind, we need&nbsp;differently compiled versions of some Boost libs (Boost.Context and Boost.Fiber); and<br>- we use a some generated code, which originates from Cap’n Proto, a protobuf-like library for object serialization.</p><p>With&nbsp;Meson, all these were easy to accomplish (for the third I use a little helper Python script), and, maybe even more importantly, in such a way that I fully understand what is going on under the hood.</p><p>Furthermore, some personal favourites about Meson are:<br>-&nbsp;the concept of a dependency, which lets you bundle libraries with include paths, and the different ways to obtain such dependency (automatic vs. manually)<br>- one does not have to specify header files in the executable target to make IDEs happy<br>- integration with pkg-config and CMake, to locate system-installed libs<br>- easy-to-manage configuration options&nbsp;<br>- out-of-the-box support common stuff (sanitizer support, coverage builds, stripping binaries, etc.)<br>- easy-to-extend while maintaining transparency<br>- parallel unit tests</p></div>
                            <h4>To conclude<br></h4>
                            <div><p>A&nbsp;key benefit of a good and transparent build system is that it will save you time, and that it makes it much easier to use helper tools that&nbsp;will improve code quality, like Clang’s static analyzer, Address Sanitizer, coverage builds, etcetera. We are very happy with Meson,&nbsp;thanks Jussi Pakkanen!</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
The features of modern programming languages
make it easy to write clear and correct programs that run systems.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Express dependencies between components using function arguments.
</p>

<p>
When service A makes use of services B and C, we need to make sure to start B and C before A.
</p>

<p>
This is straightforwardly represented with a function:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>start_a</span>(b: B, c: C) -&gt; A:
    ...
      <span>"--b-url"</span>, b.url,
      <span>"--c-url"</span>, c.url,
    ...
    <span>return</span> A(...)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This defines a function which takes two arguments, of types "B" and "C",
and which returns a value of type "A".
</p>

<p>
Naturally, if you want an A, you've got create a B and a C first:
exactly the invariant we want to enforce.
</p>

<p>
One can define such types for one's own services,
and include all the relevant information in them,
such as URLs to use to interact with them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Keep track of complex values using types.
</p>

<p>
Suppose service D can run in multiple different modes;
say, it can either listen on an HTTP or HTTP2 URL.
And suppose some other service E can only work with service D if it's in HTTP2 mode.
</p>

<p>
We can represent this with types:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>start_e</span>(d: D[HTTP2Url]) -&gt; E:
    ...
      <span>"--d-url"</span>, d.url, <span># </span><span>an HTTP2Url</span>
    ...
    <span>return</span> E(...)


<span>def</span> <span>main</span>(d: D[HTTPUrl]) -&gt; E:
    <span># </span><span>type error!</span>
    <span>return</span> start_e(d)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The D class here takes a type argument specifying what the type of <code>d.url</code> is.
We can do this with generics or templates in most modern languages.
</p>

<p>
In <code>main</code>, we call <code>start_e</code> with the wrong type of <code>D</code>,
and we'll get a compile-time type error as a result.
</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>
Create different environments by <a href="http://catern.com/config.html">passing different arguments to functions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Suppose service F has an optional dependency on service G;
it can run whether or not service G is available.
</p>

<p>
We can represent this by passing different arguments to our <code>start_f</code> function in different environments:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>start_f</span>(g: Optional[G]) -&gt; F:
    ...
    <span>if</span> g:
       ... <span>"--g-url"</span>, g.url ...
    <span>else</span>:
       <span>pass</span>
    <span>return</span> F(...)

<span>def</span> <span>environment_one</span>() -&gt; <span>None</span>:
    g = ...
    <span>f</span> = start_f(g)
    ...


<span>def</span> <span>environment_two</span>() -&gt; <span>None</span>:
    f = start_f(<span>None</span>)
    ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can use <code>environment_one</code> or <code>environment_two</code>, each where appropriate.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Test the distributed system through normal language-level tests.
</p>

<p>
Since our distributed system is started by a normal program,
we can use standard testing libraries to write our tests.
</p>

<p>
For example, Python's standard library has a <code>unittest</code> module which works fine:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>import</span> unittest

<span>class</span> <span>TestThings</span>(unittest.TestCase):
    <span>def</span> <span>setupTest</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>None</span>:
        ...
        <span>self</span>.h = start_h(...)

    <span>def</span> <span>test_some_things</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>None</span>:
        <span>self</span>.assertIn(<span>"OK"</span>, requests.get(<span>self</span>.h.url + <span>"/status"</span>))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
These tests should be stored alongside the code,
just as with normal programs.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Explore interactively using the REPL or debugger.
</p>

<p>
The functions that start our system can be called from a REPL or debugger with no additional effort.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&gt;&gt; <span>i</span> = start_i(...)
&lt;I <span>object</span> at 0x7fb3a45a4290&gt;
&gt;&gt; <span>j</span> = start_j(i, ...)
&lt;J <span>object</span> at 0x7fb3a45a4490&gt;
&gt;&gt; j.url
<span>"https://example.com"</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>
Use asynchronous code to monitor multiple processes in the background.
</p>

<p>
Each process needs to be monitored for failure.
If, for example, a process exits, appropriate action needs to be taken,
such as restarting that process or a larger collection of processes,
or signaling a fatal error.
</p>

<p>
You can use the asynchronous support in your language to monitor all the <a href="https://github.com/catern/rsyscall">processes</a> at once.
</p>

<p>
If a process exits, that can be indicated through your language's usual error-handling method
(by raising an exception, for Python),
and the error can be caught and reacted to at the appropriate level,
or allowed to propagate.
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>async def</span> <span>start_k</span>(nursery: trio.Nursery) -&gt; <span>K</span>:
    nursery.start_soon(run_command_and_wait_on_subprocess, [<span>"k"</span>, ...])
    <span>return</span> K(...)

<span>async def</span> <span>main</span>():
    <span>async with</span> trio.open_nursery() <span>as</span> nursery:
        k = <span>await</span> start_k(nursery)
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>
Avoid external dependencies and special privileges.
</p>

<p>
Most normal programs don't require calling out to external services,
nor do they require that the user hold special privileges in some authorization system.
</p>

<p>
A program or library which starts distributed systems will be more useful
if it likewise can be used without such special setup.
It will be usable in a wider range of environments,
and by a wider range of users.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
By using these techniques,
I've found it's even easier to achieve a <a href="http://catern.com/run.html">runnable system</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>If you’re like most people, your answer to this is… “What? Why?”</p>
<p>When ssh was introduced back in the 1990s, its appeal was simple. Passwords are too short, too guessable, too <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190114">phishable</a>, too often <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5586/why-do-people-think-that-this-is-bad-way-to-hash-passwords">stored incorrectly</a>, too MITM-able, too brute-forceable. Also its primary competition was rsh’s classic “no authentication,” but we don’t talk about that.</p>
<p>Compared to that, ssh public-key authentication was a dream. Generate a keypair, don’t ever share the private key with anyone, and if an attacker ever steals your authorized_keys file, the joke’s on them, because all they can do with your public key is authorize <em>you</em> to break into <em>their</em> server. Suckers!</p>
<p>It’s pretty great. And that greatness might lead you to wonder: why, then, 25 years after we learned this important lesson, are all the most secure websites on the Internet still using password authentication? Well, some good reasons, some not-so-good reasons. TLS client-side certs in web browsers have been tried many times and failed many times. That’s a story for another day.</p>
<p>My story for today is about ssh and how even public keys, while much better than simple passwords, are still not a perfect solution.</p>
<p>The danger is credential theft, which is a fancy way of saying “someone stole your private keys.” Back in the 1990s, that problem was pretty far from our minds; Windows 98 didn’t even have the concept of a separate administrator account, never mind the idea of app sandboxing or the inkling that someone might intentionally want to load malware onto your computer and encrypt all your files for ransomware. Those were the days when some people thought ActiveX controls (essentially loading .exe files from web sites) might be a good idea. Actually, maybe even a great idea as long as there was an “are you sure?” dialog box first.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, how did anything ever work? What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Anyway, public key authentication was an amazingly advanced level of protection at the time. Normal people who used ssh keys didn’t have to worry much about attacks, because there were much easier targets: the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?IdontHaveToBeTheFastestJustFasterThanYou">run faster than the bear</a> solution.</p>
<p>Time has passed, though, and attackers are getting more advanced all the time, and some of the limits are starting to show.</p>
<p>Here’s a story someone told me last year: one company had an employee they fired for bad behaviour. A few months later all their production servers got wiped out. They didn’t have enough forensics to identify how it happened, so they hired a consultant to help them reassemble it with a bit more logging for next time. A month later, it happened again! Everything gone.</p>
<p>But this time they had logs. And what the logs showed is that one of their employees had ssh’d into all the servers and smashed everything. The employee, however, had logged in from some other country where the employee demonstrably wasn’t. And it didn’t seem like an employee who couldn’t be bothered to hide their login would have bothered to use a fake IP. What happened?</p>
<p>What happened was that the rogue employee, months before they were fired, had waited until everyone went to lunch, walked around from one PC to the next, and collected the ssh private keys from any of them that weren’t locked. (Note in case you’re thinking of fixing this with a screen-locking policy: that’s not a bad start, but it’s not quite enough defense. Make sure to at least enable full-disk encryption on all your computers too, and you’re getting closer.) Then, a while after getting fired, he used a co-worker’s ssh key to login and destroy everything.</p>
<p>When they rebuilt the server cluster after the first breach, they had been super careful, constructed all the servers from scratch, avoided any possibility of installed backdoors… and then promptly dropped in the same set of ssh public keys as before. Because ssh keys are secure, right? If there’s one thing we know for sure about security, it’s that. It’s even in the name!</p>
<p>And they are secure, right up until they’re stolen. But the problem with static ssh keys is that if they are stolen, it’s undetectable. Many people avoid rotating their public keys for 10+ years. Someone might have stolen your private key 9 years ago, and is just waiting for the right moment to strike.</p>
<p>Key rotation is the simple answer to this problem. Like <a href="https://duo.com/decipher/microsoft-will-no-longer-recommend-forcing-periodic-password-changes">forced password changes (which are out of vogue now)</a>, rotating your ssh keys protects, “eventually,” against key theft, which is a lot better than no protection at all. Of course, it has some of the disadvantages of password rotation too: notably, if you have your ssh private key on several machines, you have to remember to copy it to all those places. And if you have your ssh public key on many machines - which is the whole point - now you have to correctly delete the old one and add the new one. It’s a lot of tedious, error-prone work, which is why people don’t like to do it.</p>
<p>An even more robust approach is to use some kind of hardware token that can sign short-lived ssh keys, and teach all your servers how to deal with those. That’s neat, but it’s hard to deploy (needs custom ssh settings). The deployment could be fixable - convince upstream ssh to do it in an easier way. But you still have the problem of the obnoxious hardware tokens, which then get into USB (which has too many connector types and mostly doesn’t work on a phone) or Bluetooth (which works maybe 97% of the time, which is simply not good enough for your emergency production login credentials).</p>
<p>An easier approach is to set up an <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-ssh-to-proxy-through-a-linux-jump-host/">ssh jumphost</a>, where you can contain your ssh fanciness to a single server (and even if you just use normal ssh keys, you only have to rotate them in that one place). This works pretty well, but creates added latency (the jumphost isn’t always near the server you want to jump to; or if you have a jumphost in every region, now you have to maintain a bunch of jumphosts), and of course, means that you have to do everything through ssh; you can’t route traffic directly.</p>
<p>By the way, all these credential theft problems apply to more than just ssh: WireGuard and OpenVPN private keys can be stolen in the same ways, and are a liability unless you rotate them periodically.</p>
<p>The approach we take in our own infrastructure, modeled after TLS certificate infrastructure and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> in particular, is to authenticate each device+person combination with a separate private key; that way, if a credential is stolen, we always know from where. Each device can rotate that device-specific key as often as it wants, since the private key only lives in one place, and the public keys are all distributed rapidly from our coordination server to every other device that needs them. Because of this highly consistent key rotation (which is hard with ssh keys or passwords), we always know exactly when a particular keypair has been retired, once and for all, so we can always detect if that keypair makes a surprise reappearance: it must mean credential theft, which means a breach, which can trigger forensics. After all that, we hide our ssh keys behind this network-layer key rotation, which means that unrotated ssh keys are mostly harmless; only an authorized person with non-stolen credentials can even try to exploit a stolen ssh key.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to our original question: how often should I rotate my ssh keys? More often than never! As often as you can. And make sure you retire old keys when you’re done with them.</p>

February 24, 2021 | https://blog.bam.tech/developer-news/android-logging-with-style | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bam.tech/developer-news/android-logging-with-style">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p name="a741">Logging can sometimes be seen as the tool to be used as a last resort. You write tons of throwaway log lines such as <code>"being here"</code>, <code>"user=23939"</code>, etc… and delete everything as soon as you understood the root cause of the bug. And the next time, you start again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p name="0284">I suggest that logs can be useful on a daily basis if done correctly. Here are some tips to do <strong>better logging</strong> on your Android App.</p>
<h2>How to&nbsp;log?</h2>
<p name="640e">Of course you can use the built-in Log class and its convenient static methods, <code>d(),e(),i()</code>&nbsp;…</p>
<p name="6446">But this may lack some flexibility.</p>
<p name="194a">An option is to create your own wrapper for this class and inject it into your classes. This will allow you to easily disable the logs in production build, redirect them to another output, or decorate the lines if needed.</p>
<p name="8cf5"><a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber" data-href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Timber</a> is a popular library which will allow you to do exactly that.</p>
<h2>Use the relevant Log&nbsp;Level</h2>
<p name="2dde">You should try not to flood the most important log levels. For instance, you may target this kind of pace per log level&nbsp;:</p>
<figure><img data-image-id="1*favlu-6ebBAFSL3aOR7gdA.png" data-width="1226" data-height="1310" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*favlu-6ebBAFSL3aOR7gdA.png" alt="table with suggestions of usage and flow rate for each log&nbsp;level">
<figcaption>Suggestions of usage and flow rate for each log&nbsp;level</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Meaningful Tagging</h2>
<p name="4c98">Although it’s a popular pattern to use the class name as the log tag, I suggest you don’t use a class name for your tag.</p>
<p name="2c16">First it’s leaking implementation details.</p>
<p name="aecc">It also makes filtering more difficult based on this tag, because your feature will often be implemented with multiple classes. It can also lead to tag length greater than 23, which gets truncated in output.</p>
<p name="26c4">You may use a pattern like <code>[PREFIX].[FEATURE]</code></p>
<p name="5d62">For instance for <em>My Good App</em> (MGA), you would define:</p>
<p name="0227"><code>TAG="mga.featureA"</code></p>
<p name="1bf1"><code>TAG="mga.featureB</code></p>
<p name="2666">You can add a <code>module.kt</code> at the root of a feature package containing a const like</p>
<p name="0882"><code><strong>const val </strong><em>TAG </em>= <strong>"mga.user"</strong></code></p>
<p name="3038">This file can also contain other definitions for the module, such as dependency injection definitions.</p>
<h2>What to&nbsp;Log?</h2>
<h3>Important lifecycle events</h3>
<p name="35fe">Lots of Android apps bugs and mis-behaviors are related to the Android lifecycle. You should always be logging this kind of information. If you have a base Fragment inherited by all your Fragments (and you should!) use it to log these events.</p>

<p name="46cd">This also has the advantage of leaving a trace of all navigation actions, and gives easy access to the current Fragment name. This can save a lot of time for a <strong>newcomer discovering the app</strong> and its code base.</p>
<h3>Almost all of the user&nbsp;actions</h3>
<p name="3c87">All user actions should lead to something being printed into logs. This doesn’t mean that all the click handlers in the UI layer should print something, but that the action that is triggered in your domain layer should print something with some relevant parameters.</p>

<h3>App version, buildFlavor</h3>
<p name="82ab">Use your app’s Application class to log some basic information about your App version and variant. This way you will be able to link a log to a specific version without ambiguity, even if some days or months have passed.</p>


<h3>App configuration</h3>
<p name="68c4">In addition to the previous point, also log dynamic configuration at startup and when it is changed. Since this can influence the behavior of your app, it is crucial to have this information to interpret the logs.</p>
<h2>Remote Logging Solutions</h2>
<p name="88ac">Sometimes problems only happen on customer devices and you may need contextual information to figure out what is going on.</p>
<p name="e492">Remote logging is your friend in this situation.</p>
<p name="9eb9">Did you know that <em>Firebase Crashlytics</em> provides a way to log <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports?platform=android#log-excepts" data-href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports?platform=android#log-excepts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Non-fatal exceptions</a>?</p>
<p name="4a05">It should be enough to get more context on an inconsistent state that you can’t reproduce.</p>
<p name="4bbd">Should you need more contextual information, you could use the remote logging feature provided by <a href="https://bugfender.com/" data-href="https://bugfender.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bugfender</a>, which basically provides the same output as <em>Logcat</em> (ie. all the traces) as if you were plugging a USB debug cable in to your customer’s device!</p>
<h2>Don’t use Unicode&nbsp;symbols</h2>
<p name="551a">Log content should be simple and reliable, and is not intended to be <a href="https://medium.com/swift-programming/swift-prettify-your-print-statements-pt-1-64832bb7fafa" data-href="https://medium.com/swift-programming/swift-prettify-your-print-statements-pt-1-64832bb7fafa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eye-candy or fun</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may have to copy-past it from various terminals, text editors and web sites that may not support UTF-8 well (or at all).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will have to search through it, and it seems that looking for a text pattern instead of a random emojis will be more efficient.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p name="5ae9">In other words don’t give in to the siren song and <strong>keep-it super boring and simple</strong>.</p>
<h2>Use more than Android Studio Log&nbsp;View</h2>
<p name="6642">Although the <em>Logcat</em> tool window is one click away from your code and provides convenient filtering features, you may find it a little bit limited for advanced usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can only have one instance of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering is handy but somehow limited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may randomly lose all the content</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p name="b8e7">Try to use other tools such as <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flipper" data-href="https://github.com/facebook/flipper" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Facebook Flipper</a> or simply dedicated terminal windows</p>
<h2>Use a&nbsp;Terminal</h2>
<p name="39f0">As you pay more attention to logging, using dedicated terminal windows will become obvious.</p>
<p name="7087">First, you will be able to open several logging windows. Why would you want to do this? Because it will allow you to log different parts of your app in different windows.</p>
<p name="b50e">You can have for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network calls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigation events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debug log for the feature currently in work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p name="da16">I also suggest always having an unfiltered <em>Logcat</em> window always running. It will record all the activity with infinite scroll history and will be helpful for transient and hard to reproduce crashes. Also sometimes Android <em>system logs</em> can help you figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p name="6c45">If you are using meaningful tagging, you can then easily see all network logs using&nbsp;:</p>
<p name="79a2"><code>$ adb logcat | grep — line-buffered “mga.network”</code></p>
<p name="3aef">Want to know all emitted analytics events&nbsp;?</p>
<p name="1e97"><code>$ adb logcat | grep — line-buffered “mga.analytics”</code></p>
<p name="63dc">Finally, you are working with the location and booking modules and want to see only the logs related to these?</p>
<p name="9e90"><code>$ adb logcat | grep — line-buffered “mga.location|mga.booking”</code></p>
<h2>Colorize your&nbsp;logs</h2>
<p name="b287">Of course it’s always better to colorize your logs.</p>
<p name="7631"><em>Logcat</em> now provides this option:</p>
<p name="feee"><code>$ adb logcat -v color</code></p>
<figure><img data-image-id="1*jdib5OLOr8jWvqsAx3YcmQ.png" data-width="2590" data-height="1094" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*jdib5OLOr8jWvqsAx3YcmQ.png" alt="Screen capture of a colored logcat terminal">
<figcaption>colored logcat&nbsp;output</figcaption>
</figure>

<p name="9e35">You may also use a third-party wrapper such as <a href="https://github.com/marshall/logcat-color" data-href="https://github.com/marshall/logcat-color" rel="noopener" target="_blank">logcat-color</a>, that some people will find more readable.</p>
<figure><img data-image-id="1*gQCqFE27Zh_kWpXXxNAPMw.png" data-width="2590" data-height="1094" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gQCqFE27Zh_kWpXXxNAPMw.png" alt="Screen capture of a logcat-color terminal">
<figcaption>logcat-color output</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Edit:</em> You may also try <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pidcat</a> which allow to filter logcat output by application package just like Android Studio!</p>
<h2>Intend your logs for non-developer people</h2>
<p name="0fa2">Do you think <em>Logcat</em> is for developers only?&nbsp;</p>
<p name="7d43">You might want to consider having your logs readable by anybody involved in the project, particularly people involved in testing. Sooner or later you will have a bug that will take hours to reproduce and can be detected only by a logged statement, or you may have to leak some information (auth token, database ID…) to people in charge of testing without creating a dedicated “hidden diagnostic” menu entry. Should any of this occur, having your testing team used to read the typical <em>Logcat</em> output of your App may help a lot.</p>
<h2>Remove your logs from your production build</h2>
<p name="90c1">Since logs can contain security and privacy sensitive information, it’s good practice to remove logs from your production build. That’s where custom log module or Timber come handy, but you can simply get rid of <code>Log</code> statements using <em>Proguard</em> (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2466662" data-href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2466662" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/a/2466662</a>)</p>
<h2>Always keep an eye on your&nbsp;logs</h2>
<p name="98d2">While developing and testing your app, you should always have an eye on your log. This way you will be able to detect unusual behavior more easily. Think about a bug where your app is repeating a network call every 5 seconds. This can be completely invisible from the UI point of view and can therefore pass the QA tests successfully. However, it can have dramatic consequences for your user’s battery and data plan, as well as your server.</p>
<p name="f1a7">A trained eye would have immediately noticed the unusual log flood on the idle app.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p name="af6e">In conclusion, it’s quite easy to pay better attention to your App logs, and it can be of great help in critical times and also help you and your teammates be more effective on a daily basis.</p></span>

<h2>What is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)?</h2>
<p>An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a data structure used to reason about the grammar of a programming language in the context of the instructions provided into source code.</p>
<p><img alt="From source code to binary" src="https://pybit.es/images/astintro/pipeline.png"></p>
<p>For instance, compilers use ASTs when transforming source code into binary code:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Given some text source code, the compiler first tokenizes the text to identify programming language keywords, variables, literals, etc. Each token represents an "atom" of an instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tokens are then rearranged into an AST, a tree where nodes are the "atoms" of the instructions, and edges the relationships between the atoms based on the programming language grammar. For instance, the AST make explicit the presence of a function call, the related input arguments, the instructions composing the function, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compiler then can apply multiple optimizations to the AST, and ultimately converts it into binary code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite their role for compilers, ASTs are useful for a broader set of use-cases. Let's discuss this more in details.</p>

<h2>The <code>ast</code> Python module and its use</h2>
<p>The <code>ast</code> module in the Python standard library can be used to create, visit, and modify AST related to Python source code. It has been introduced in <a href="https://docs.python.org/release/2.6/whatsnew/2.6.html#the-ast-module">Python 2.6</a>, and since then it evolved alongside the Python grammar.</p>
<p>Even if it is part of standard library since a long time, it is not common to use it <em>directly</em>. Rather, you might have used it <em>indirectly</em> as popular tools use it under-the-hood:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>code testing</strong>: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/MutPy/"><code>mutpy</code></a> is a mutation testing tool used to alters the code under testing to broaden the set of tests in an automated fashion. In practice a mutation is an artificial modification of the AST generated from the code under testing. To see how PyBites uses <code>mutpy</code>, check out <a href="https://pybit.es/guest-mutpy-exploration.html">this article</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>code coverage</strong>: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/vulture/"><code>vulture</code></a> is a static code analyzer that studies an AST to identify portion of the code not used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>code vulnerabilities</strong>: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bandit/"><code>bandit</code></a> uses the AST representation to identify security vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>code autocompletion</strong>: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jedi/"><code>jedi</code></a> is an IDE and text editors autocompletion tool relying on the <code>ast</code> module functionality to safely evaluate expressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>code reformating</strong>: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/"><code>black</code></a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flake8/"><code>flake8</code></a> are two popular tools to enforce code reformatting, and they both use an AST representation of the source code to apply their formatting rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the <code>ast</code> module to investigate the PyBites Bite exercises</h2>
<p>Still not convinced of the relevance of an AST? Fair enough: let's consider a more practical, and closer to the PyBites Platform, use-case.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://codechalleng.es/">PyBites Platform</a> is currently offering 300+ Bite exercises, and the number is constantly increasing. Given the (semi)hidden intention of the platform is to offer a varied set of challenges covering different Python modules and functionalities, it starts to be more and more challenging to identify what is covered by already available exercises, and what is instead left to explore.</p>
<p>This is where we can take advantage of the <code>ast</code> module. Specifically, we can process the source code of the solution of the exercises (as provided by the authors of the challenges) and recover some statistics about their content. For instance, which are the popular modules and builtin functions used.</p>
<p>Here some of the results. To follow along check out <a href="https://github.com/pybites/notebooks/tree/main/ast-intro">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>

<h3>Builtins popularity</h3>
<p><img src="https://pybit.es/images/astintro/plot_builtins.png" alt="Pybites exercises - builtins popularity" height="600px"></p>
<p>The histogram above shows the Python builtin calls sorted by their popularity. In other words, using the <code>ast</code> module one can detect when a function call has been made, and if it relates to the <code>builtins</code> module or not. Three colors are used to visually distinguish between exception types, the creation of base types (<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>list</code>, and <code>set</code>), or other functions. The histogram is a normalized frequency count, i.e., the frequency of each element is cumulated across all exercises, and divided by the sum of all elements occurrence across all exercises.</p>
<p>A few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The distribution is heavy tailed, with <code>len()</code> representing 13.4% of all builtin calls, while <code>dir()</code> being used only once. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All five base types are used, but <code>bool()</code> is used only in 1 challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 5 of the standard exceptions are used, with <code>ValueError</code> being the most common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the builtin functions are already used by exercises, but considering the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html">functional programming calls</a> you can notice that <code>map()</code> appears while <code>filter()</code> does not (as indeed the common practice is to prefer <a href="https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/#profile-to-optimize-performance">list comprehension</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modules popularity</h3>
<p><img src="https://pybit.es/images/astintro/plot_modules.png" alt="Pybites exercises - modules popularity" height="600px"></p>
<p>The histogram above shows the ranking for modules. For simplicity we limit to report on the root modules only. If submodules are used, their frequencies are cumulated into the frequency of the respective root modules.</p>
<p>As before, the histogram is heavy tailed, a testament that the PyBites Bite exercises try to "cover a little bit of everything".</p>
<p>We can observe the presence of non-standard modules, such as <code>pandas</code> and <code>pytest</code>, as well more ad-hoc modules such as as <code>zodiac</code> and <code>fibonacci</code> that are created for the purpose of the challenges themselves.</p>
<p>One can easily expand the analysis to understand the functions used in each module/submodule, as well as dive into more specific analysis. What is relevant to highlight is that the results reported here are generated with about 50 lines of Python code and using <code>ast</code> module. Processing the 300+ source code files with tools like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html"><code>awk</code></a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/"><code>grep</code></a>, or anything else would have been significantly harder.</p>
<p>Hopefully this examples gave you a rough idea of what you can achieve with an AST. The next step is to understand how to create such data structures, and investigate their composition.</p>

<h2>Dissecting an assignment instruction using the <code>ast</code> module</h2>
<p>To start familiarize with the <code>ast</code> module, let's see what happens when we analyze a single instruction: <code>one_plus_two = 1+2</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>ast</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>code</span> <span>=</span> <span>"one_plus_two = 1+2"</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span> <span>=</span> <span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>code</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>tree</span><span>,</span> <span>indent</span><span>=</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Module(</span>
<span>    body=[</span>
<span>        Assign(</span>
<span>            targets=[</span>
<span>                Name(id='one_plus_two', ctx=Store())],</span>
<span>            value=BinOp(</span>
<span>                left=Constant(value=1),</span>
<span>                op=Add(),</span>
<span>                right=Constant(value=2)))],</span>
<span>    type_ignores=[])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It might not be obvious at first, but the output generated by <code>ast.dump()</code> is actually a tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The words starting with capital letter are nodes of the tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attributes of the nodes are either edges of the tree or metadata.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's rework the output into a diagram with the following conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One rectangle for each node, marking in bold the related node type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node attributes collecting metadata are reported in blue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other node attributes are annotated with their type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nodes are connected based on their attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AST sketch" src="https://pybit.es/images/astintro/tree-sketch.png"></p>
<p>With this visualization at hand we can observe a few things.</p>
<p>The root of the tree is a <code>Module</code> node. In fact, even if our example is a single line program, it is still a true Python module. The node contains two attributes <code>body</code> and <code>type_ignores</code>. Let's put the aside <code>type_ignores</code> for a moment and focus on <code>body</code>.</p>
<p>As a Python module contains a series of instructions, the <code>Module.body</code> attribute is a list of nodes, one for each instruction in the program. Our example consists of a single assignment operation, hence <code>Module.body</code> contains only one <code>Assign</code> node.</p>
<p>An assignment operation has a <em>right-hand side</em> specifying the <em>operation</em> to perform, and a <em>left-hand side</em> specifying the <em>destination</em> of the operation. The two sides are associated to the <code>Assign.value</code> and <code>Assign.targets</code> attributes of the <code>Assign</code> node.</p>
<p>Considering the right-hand side, the <code>Assign.value</code> attribute is a <code>BinOp</code> node, since the instruction is a binary operation between two operands, which is fully specified with three attributes: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>BinOp.op</code> is a <code>Add</code> node given we are performing an addition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>BinOp.left</code> and <code>BinOp.right</code> are the addition operands and consist of <code>Constant</code> nodes, each holding the raw value in the <code>Constant.value</code> attribute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the left-side, as Python supports multiple assignments and tuple unpacking, the <code>Assign.targets</code> attribute is a list collecting the different destinations of the operation. In our case the assignment is for a single variable, so a single <code>Name</code> node is used. In turn, the <code>Name</code> node has 2 attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Name.id</code> stores the name of the variable used in the program (<code>"one_plus_two"</code>). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Name.ctx</code> specifies how variable reference is used in the program. This can only be one of types <code>ast.Load</code>, <code>ast.Remove</code> or <code>ast.Store</code>, but those are always empty nodes. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The <code>Module.type_ignores</code> attribute and type comments</h3>
<p>The attribute <code>Module.type_ignores</code> in the vast majority of the cases is going to be an empty list. This is why in the sketch is colored in blue. To understand why this is the case and what is the actual purpose of the attribute, we need to make a digression.</p>
<p>Python 3.0 introduced annotations, and few years later those have been expanded into type hints. If you are not familiar with those concepts, check this <a href="https://realpython.com/lessons/type-comments/">Real Python tutorial</a> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing#module-typing">official doc</a>.</p>
<p>Those changes were not back ported to Python 2, which instead was using <strong>type comments</strong> as a form of annotation. For more information, see <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#type-comments">PEP 484</a> or this <a href="https://realpython.com/lessons/type-comments/">Real Python tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>The attribute <code>Module.type_ignores</code> refers to a special type comment <code># type: ignore</code> that was used to indicate to type checker (such as <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>) to suppress errors if one was found. For legacy reasons, the <code>ast</code> module is still reporting on those comments, but <em>only when asked</em> to do so.</p>
<p>Let's see an example.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>code</span> <span>=</span> <span>'one_plus_two = 1+2 # type: int'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span> <span>=</span> <span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>code</span><span>,</span> <span>type_comments</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>ast</span>…</pre></div></div></div>

<p>Lightmeter uses trademarks for the project (Lightmeter), applications (e.g. Lightmeter Control Center), and technology components or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brand-ingredients-powerful-business-strategy-q-uirino-malandrino/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ingredients</a> (e.g. <a href="https://lightmeter.io/introducing-ray-chaser-email-tracing-engine/">Ray Chaser</a>).</p>



<p>Trademarks are a type of intellectual property, and they therefore restrict people’s freedom to use certain words and images in some contexts. Does this mean that using trademarks contradicts Open Source <a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/freesoftware.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">principles</a> of maximising freedom and collaboration?</p>



<p>The short answer is “no”, because some trademark protections are necessary to ensure that broader freedoms exist for everyone.</p>



<h2 id="motivations-to-trademark">Motivations to trademark<a href="#motivations-to-trademark"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>There’s a long history of the abuse and misuse of Open Source software which could have been avoided if trademarks had been effectively used to defend it. </p>



<p>The effects of Open Source trademarks and their absence are not intuitive, and by the time a related problem arises it’s often too late to resolve it, due to the <a href="https://www.legalteamusa.net/trademark-law-first-to-use-v-first-to-file/">central role of timing</a> in trademark litigation.</p>



<p>Neither the terms “Open Source” nor “<a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Free Software</a>” are themselves trademarked, which unfortunately allows anyone to use them to describe anything – companies <a href="https://openwashing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly</a> <a href="https://opensource.org/node/1099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploit</a> this to undermine public understanding of the freedoms which the words originally conveyed.</p>







<p><strong>This is why we are using trademarks early and often in Lightmeter</strong> — to avoid problems for users and ourselves later on.</p>



<h2 id="in-theory-trademarks-protect-freedom">In theory: trademarks protect freedom<a href="#in-theory-trademarks-protect-freedom"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>For many people to posses broad <strong>freedom to</strong> do what they like, they must have <strong>freedom from</strong> certain obstacles to freedom such as, in the extreme, their imprisonment or murder. This is called <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive vs negative freedom</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Freedom from</strong> those obstacles entails limits on other people’s <strong>freedom to</strong> do the imprisoning and murdering. Trademarks constrain the freedom of a minority of people who would use it to abuse the freedom of others. In this way trademarks are used to guarantee the freedom of the majority.</p>



<h2 id="in-practice-trademarks-prevent-abuse">In practice: trademarks prevent abuse<a href="#in-practice-trademarks-prevent-abuse"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>Having trademarks impacts many specific avoidable problems; they:</p>



<ul><li>Help guarantee the quality of releases made in our name (e.g. no <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2699814/filezilla-warns-of-large-malware-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">malware included</a>)</li><li>Help build a brand and identity to attract users and contributors</li><li>Prevent companies from <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lying about endorsements</a> and support from us</li><li>Prevent companies from <a href="https://www.gerv.net/hacking/pay-download-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charging people</a> to download our Free Software</li><li>Prevent the false attribution of bad behaviour to us</li><li>Avoid legal liability for products which pretend to be made by us</li><li>Allow us to register domains and social media accounts which require trademarks</li><li>Prevent other software pretending to have the same innovations we do</li><li>In the case of a software fork distinguish between the two editions</li></ul>



<p>Additionally opportunities are provided by using trademarks because they:</p>



<ul><li>Help communicate how innovative features are different to competing systems</li><li>Make several aspects of providing future commercial services more viable</li></ul>



<h2 id="proactivity-is-not-optional">Proactivity is not optional<a href="#proactivity-is-not-optional"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>By the time that bad behaviour as occurred which relates to trademarks, new trademarks cannot be registered to help. </p>



<p>Trademarks must be registered early and actively asserted and defended in order to have legal meaning. In many countries whoever registers a particular name or image first gets to own it forever.</p>



<h2 id="our-strategy">Our strategy<a href="#our-strategy"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>Open Source products should not be at a disadvantage to proprietary ones or vulnerable to exploitation. To make empowering new tools we must protect our collective interest and investment, and trademarks are legitimate and necessary means of doing so.</p>



<p>For these reasons we trademark Open Source software at Lightmeter, and you will see the ™ trademark symbol and the ® registered symbol next to some words and images. We look forward to adding more as Lightmeter shares additional innovations in future.</p>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In 1991 Guido van Rossum released the first version of the Python programming language. About that time the world began to witness a major change in how computer systems represent written language. The internalization of the Internet increased the demand to support different writing systems, and the Unicode Standard was developed to meet this demand. Unicode defined a universal character set able to represent any written language, various non-alphanumeric symbols and, eventually, emoji 😀. Python wasn't designed with Unicode in mind, but it evolved towards Unicode support during the years. The major change happened when Python got a built-in support for Unicode strings – the <code>unicode</code> type that later became the <code>str</code> type in Python 3. Python strings have been proven to be a convenient way to work with text in the Unicode age. Today we'll see how they work behind the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>The scope of this post</h2>
<p>This post doesn't try to cover all aspects of text encoding in relation to Python. You see, programming language designers have to make several text encoding decisions because they have to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to talk to the external world (the encodings of command-line parameters, environment variables, standard streams and the file system).</li>
<li>How to read the source code (the encoding of source files).</li>
<li>How to represent text internally (the encoding of strings).</li>
</ul>
<p>This post focuses on the last problem. But before we dive into the internals of Python strings, let's briefly discuss the problem of text encoding on a real life example and clarify what Unicode really is.</p>
<h2>The essence of text encoding</h2>
<p>You see this text as a sequence of characters rendered by your browser and displayed on your screen. I see this text as the same sequence of characters as I type it into my editor. In order for us to see the same thing, your browser and my editor must be able to represent the same set of characters, that is, they must agree on a <strong>character set</strong>. They also need to choose some, possibly different, ways to represent the text internally to be able to work with it. For example, they may choose to map each character to a unit consisting of one or more bytes and represent the text as a sequence of those units. Such a mapping is usually referred to as a <strong>character encoding</strong>. A character encoding is also crucial for our communication. Your browser and my web server must agree on how to <strong>encode</strong> text into bytes and <strong>decode</strong> text from bytes, since bytes is what they transmit to talk to each other.</p>
<p>The character set that your browser and my editor use is Unicode. Unicode is able to represent English as well as any other written language you can think of (文言, Čeština, Ελληνικά, עברית, हिन्दी), 日本語, Português, Русский) and thousands of miscellaneous symbols (₤, ⅐, ↳, ∭, ⌘, , ♫, 👨🏼‍💻, 🍺) . My web server sends this text as a part of the HTML page in the UTF-8 encoding. You browser knows which encoding was used to encode the text because the <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header declares the encoding:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
</pre></div>


<p>Even if you save this HTML page locally, your browser will still be able to detect its encoding because the encoding is specified in the HTML itself:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>html</span> <span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>meta</span> <span>charset</span><span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This may seem absurd to you. How can a browser decode the HTML to read the encoding if it doesn't know the encoding yet? This is usually not a problem in practice because the beginning of an HTML page contains only ASCII characters and most encodings used on the web encode ASCII characters in the same way. Check out the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#concept-encoding-confidence">HTML standard</a> to learn more about the algorithm that browsers use to determine the encoding.</p>
<p>Note that the HTTP header and the HTML metatag specify "charset", i.e. a character set. This may seem confusing since UTF-8 is not a character set. What they really specify is a character encoding. The two terms are often used interchangeably because character encodings typically imply a character set of the same name. For example, the ASCII character encoding implies the ASCII character set. The Unicode Standard fixes the terminology by giving precise definitions to all important terms. We'll study them, but before, let's discuss why and how the Unicode project began.</p>
<h2>The road to Unicode</h2>
<p>Before the adoption of Unicode, most computer systems used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> character encoding that encodes a set of 128 characters using a 7-bit pattern to encode each character. ASCII was sufficient to deal with English texts but that's about it. Other character encodings were developed to support more languages. Most of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII">extended ASCII</a> to 256 characters and used one byte to encode each character. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859">ISO 8859</a> standard defined a family of 15 such character encodings. Among them were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latin Western European ISO 8859-1 (German, French, Portuguese, Italian, etc.)</li>
<li>Central European ISO 8859-2 (Polish, Croatian, Czech, Slovak, etc.)</li>
<li>Latin/Cyrillic ISO 8859-5 (Russian, Serbian, Ukrainian, etc.)</li>
<li>Latin/Arabic ISO 8859-6</li>
<li>Latin/Greek ISO 8859-7.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multi-lingual software had to handle many different character encodings. This complicated things a lot. Another problem was to choose the right encoding to decode text. Failing to do so resulted in a garbled text known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake">mojibake</a>. For example, if you encode the Russian word for mojibake "кракозябры" using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOI8-R">KOI-8</a> encoding and decode it using ISO 8859-1, you'll get "ËÒÁËÏÚÑÂÒÙ".</p>
<p>The problems with different character encodings are not gone completely. Nevertheless, it became much more easier to write multi-lingual software nowadays. This is due to two independent initiatives that began in the late 1980s. One was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set">ISO 10646</a>, an international standard, and the other was Unicode, a project organized by a group of software companies. Both projects had the same goal: to replace hundreds of conflicting character encodings with a single universal one that covers all languages in widespread use. They quickly realized that having two different universal character sets wouldn't help achieve the goal, so in 1991 the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) defined by ISO 10646 and Unicode's character set were unified. Today the projects define essentially the same character encoding model. Nevertheless, both continue to exist. The difference between them is that the Unicode Standard has a greater scope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The assignment of characters is only a small fraction of what the Unicode Standard and its associated specifications provide. The specifications give programmers extensive descriptions and a vast amount of data about the handling of text, including how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>divide words and break lines </li>
<li>sort text in different languages </li>
<li>format numbers, dates, times, and other elements appropriate to different locales </li>
<li>display text for languages whose written form flows from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew </li>
<li>display text in which the written form splits, combines, and reorders, such as for the languages of South Asia </li>
<li>deal with security concerns regarding the many look-alike characters from writing systems around the world</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important thing that we need to understand about Unicode is how it encodes characters.</p>
<h2>Unicode basics</h2>
<p>Unicode defines <strong>characters</strong> as smallest components of written language that have semantic value. This means that such units as diacritical marks are considered to be characters on their own. Multiple Unicode characters can be combined to produce what visually looks like a single character. Such combinations of characters are called <strong>grapheme clusters</strong> in Unicode. For example, the string "á" is a grapheme cluster that consists of two characters: the Latin letter "a" and the acute accent "´". Unicode encodes some grapheme clusters as separate characters as well, but does that solely for compatibility with legacy encodings. Due to combining characters, Unicode can represent all sorts of grapheme clusters such as "ä́" and, at the same time, keep the character set relatively simple.</p>
<p>Unicode characters are abstract. The standard doesn't care about the exact shape a character takes when it's rendered. The shape, called a <strong>glyph</strong>, is considered to be a concern of a font designer. The connection between characters and glyphs can be quite complicated. Multiple characters can merge into a single glyph. A single character can be rendered as multiple glyphs. And how characters map to glyphs can depend on the context. Check out the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/#CharactersVsGlyphs">Unicode Technical Report #17</a> for examples.</p>
<p>Unicode doesn't map characters to bytes directly. It does the mapping in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>coded character set</strong> maps characters to code points.</li>
<li>A <strong>character encoding form</strong>, such as UTF-8, maps code points to sequences of code units, where each code unit is a sequence of one or more bytes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unicode coded character set is what we usually mean when we say Unicode. It's the same thing as the UCS defined by ISO 10646. The word "coded" means that it's not actually a set but a mapping. This mapping assigns a code point to each character in the character set. A <strong>code point</strong> is just an integer in the range [0, 1114111], which is written as U+0000..U+10FFFF in the Unicode hexadecimal notation and is called a <strong>code space</strong>. The current Unicode 13.0 assigns code points to 143,859 characters.</p>
<p>Technically, the coded character set is a <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/">collection of entries</a>. Each entry defines a character and assigns a code point to it by specifying three pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the code point value</li>
<li>the name of the character; and</li>
<li>a representative glyph.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the entry for the letter "b" looks like this: (U+0062, LATIN SMALL LETTER B, b).</p>
<p>The standard also specifies various character properties such as whether the character is a letter, a numeral or some other symbol, whether it's written from left-to-right or from right-to-left and whether it's an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a theory about the <em>future of programming</em>. I doubt I’m the first to have it, but as far as I can tell this isn’t the mainstream thought in the area, and I want to see if this connects for other folks.</p><p>There’s this idea about having ‘one way to do things’, that I think is most famous in its phrasing from the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a></p><blockquote><p>There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.</p></blockquote><p>Perl has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">opposite motto: There’s more than one way to do it</a>. Whether it’s better to have “one way to do things”, as I’d guess is the dictum of Python and Go, or many ways, like Rust, JavaScript, Lisps, etc, it’s sort of undecided.</p><p>But let’s flip the telescope around and peer into the other end.</p><hr><p>Programming is about data structures and the ways you manipulate them. There are few languages that can claim to have <em>one way to store things</em>.</p><p>I claim that most <em>simple</em> programming environments are simple because their datatypes are simple, not because their control flow or statements or expressions are simple. Let’s take a look:</p><p>Excel spreadsheets support sheets, columns, rows, and cells. That’s it. Until very recently (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/10/29/connect-to-your-own-data-with-more-new-data-types-in-excel/">2020</a>), cells were extremely limited in what they could represent, and even with fancy new cells, those types are curated. Excel formulas work, and compose so well, because a column of numbers is generally the same in any kind of document.</p><p>Successful visual programming thrives in constrained environments in which data is mostly homogenous. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data#Language_features">Pure data</a> has four simple kinds of ‘atoms’. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_%28software%29">Max/MSP</a> has a few more, but still limited and non-extensible.</p><p>What has made R and Python such successful platforms for data science isn’t just TensorFlow and ggplot, but the thing that connects the parts of the data science toolkit together: dataframes. The Python ecosystem is far from perfect, but the fact that there are complex datatypes that can handle a wide variety of research data inputs &amp; outputs, and that can be used by multiple packages - that pandas can talk to <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/relational.html#relating-variables-with-scatter-plots">seaborn</a> to quickly generate a chart - is remarkable.</p><p>In comparison, there are lots of systems in which the common data types are so low-level and people are so hesitant to accept shared definitions that every “computation” problem meets an equal or greater “representation” problem.</p><ul><li>Going to parse a webpage? Is the webpage a DOM? A plain-old nested object? Somewhere in between, like a <a href="https://cheerio.js.org/">cheerio</a> or jQuery wrapper?</li><li>Going to manipulate a color? Is it a RGB triplet in an array, or an object? Or is it an instance of a <a href="https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/">class in a helper module</a>, or a hex string?</li></ul><p>There’s so much energy put into visual programming or functional programming so that we can “connect things,” but not nearly as much time spent on <em>what those things are</em>. So what you get is the ability to connect any “compatible” parts, but a poor definition of what compatibility is, what those types are.</p><p>What if a simpler programming language had first-class representations of a lot more than strings and arrays? Of course this would rankle seasoned developers who want ultimate power and prefer tiny extensible systems. When developers think of advanced type systems, they think of things like <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type">Haskell’s scary-powerful</a> primitives for creating new types, not of ecosystem-supported common types.</p><p>But if the aim is ease of use and giving power to people who otherwise wouldn’t be doing programming, type-rich systems with lots of assumptions seem like a logical first step. And one that doesn’t need a visual editor or a new dialect of a rare programming language.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Later last year (2020) I bought a few bitcoin, that went up in value. A few months later, in January 2021, in a moment’s panic, as the price dropped, I sold them.</p>



<p>I now found myself in a neutral position again to see if it was worth reinvesting what I’d made (and by this time I had done a lot more research). To cut a long story short, yes, but no.</p>



<p>Yes, because for the time being, I expect Bitcoin to continue increasing in value.</p>



<p>No, because Bitcoin has mutated into a monstrous, unethical ponzi scheme that utterly fails to live up to what was described in the original <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a>. Instead of peer to peer cash-like payments, it is now being used for speculation, as “digital gold”, with holders of Bitcoin egging others on to buy Bitcoin at increasingly ridicolous prices, with little to no regard for those who will be left holding the bag when the music stops.</p>



<h2>Tim Bray</h2>



<p>The first article online that made me pause for thought was written by Tim Bray, who’s been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tim+bray+bitcoin&amp;oq=tim+bray+bit&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i22i30j69i64j69i60l3.3420j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">experimenting</a> with Bitcoin for years and is clearly familiar with the technology.</p>



<p>Here’s the key paragraph in his <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/01/20/When-You-Know">recent</a> post:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>What I see now: Run screaming from Bitcoin</strong> · It is completely unambiguously obvious to me that Bitcoin, a brilliant achievement technically, is functioning as a Ponzi scheme, siphoning money from the pockets of rubes and into those of exchange insiders and China-based miners. I’m less alone in this position than I was in some of those others, I think a high proportion of tech insiders know perfectly well that this is a looming financial disaster.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Amy Castor</h2>



<p>Tim then references <a href="https://twitter.com/ahcastor">Amy Castor</a> who’s been researching various cases of what seems like fraudulent activity at the very centre of Bitcoin, such as USDT: a token used on exchanges to buy Bitcoin, but which hasn’t properly been audited. For all we know these tokens are being produced out of thin air and then being used to buy Bitcoin, encouraging others to then spend their hard-earned <em>real</em> money in fear of missing out of getting rich. </p>



<h2>Crypto Anonymous</h2>



<p>Then I found an <a href="https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3">article</a> by someone clearly wanting to remain anonymous explaining the rate at which Tether (USDT) is being used to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:</p>



<figure><img src="https://f0pub.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/ee7bc-185xfugkrpm_9krgpn8-irw.png" alt="Image for post"></figure>



<p>There’s a shocking level of reliance on these USD-T tokens, and a strong correlation between their issuance and the price of Bitcoin going up. The issuers have a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/">questionable history</a>, and we don’t even know if their books are clean yet.</p>



<h2><a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/02/03/tether-printer-go-brrrrr/">David Gerard</a></h2>



<blockquote><p>Tether (USDT) is the cryptocurrency trading economy’s favourite substitute US dollar.&nbsp;<em>Most</em>&nbsp;Bitcoin trading is against USDT — not against actual money. There’s about 27 billion tethers in circulation.</p></blockquote>



<h2><a href="https://kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/">Patrick Mackenzie</a></h2>



<blockquote><p>A friend of mine, who works in finance, asked me to explain what <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a> was.</p><p>Short version: <strong>Tether is the internal accounting system for the largest fraud since Madoff</strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>That said, be sure to read the <a href="https://kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/">long version</a> too. Patrick now works at Stripe, and although he probably can’t speak for them, he likely sees the writing on the wall, with his employer planning accordingly. If Stripe too saw Bitcoin as the next big thing, they’d be preparing APIs for it. Instead <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support">Stripe publicly dropped support for Bitcoin in 2018.</a></p>



<h2>“Decentralisation”</h2>



<p>That bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are decentralised is just a huge dangerous lie.</p>



<ul><li>The<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin"> source code</a> is controlled by a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/people">central committee</a> of developers who control the direction of the project.<ul><li>They’re human and far from perfect, having previously cancelled <a href="http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi">Gavin Andresen</a>, one of the original co-creators of Bitcoin for naming <a href="https://craigwright.net/">Craig Wright</a> as the original creator of Bitcoin (“Satoshi Nakamoto”).</li></ul><ul><li>If only a centralised committee of unaccountable developers can change the protocol that has critical mass at any time, it’s not decentralised. In fact it’s more dangerous than money being in the control of accountable government officials.</li></ul></li><li>Bitcoin is in some sense being sold as decentralised (all users are “equal”) in the way communism is/was sold as decentralised (all people are “equal”). Yet we know from history that such abdication of agency never ends well. When everyone pretends no one is in power and everyone is equal, it only sets the stage for some really dangerous characters to take control.<ul><li>This is no defense of the current financial system – it has flaws, but is also well regulated by the government with appointed staff (by those elected by people) who are accountable for the smooth and fair running of the system.</li><li>With “decentralisation” there is no notion of accountability – how can there be, when every node and user is equal? Who do you go to or appeal to if something goes badly wrong?</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Even if you on some level buy the decentralised argument, consider this:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Any currency/asset that offers uncapped upside will eventually centralise in its ecosystem. Bitcoin is not an economically decentralised currency. </p><p>In fact its already more centralised than the US economy (0.01% own 42% of the wealth, compared to 12% in the US economy)</p></div>— Oliver Sauter (@BlackForestBoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackForestBoi/status/1362756895581339648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>Bitcoin vs Fiat</h2>



<p>Bitcoin is commonly advertised as a hedge against fiat. Yet, put simply:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Fiat is backed by agency.</p><p>Crypto isn't. This renders it vulnerable to takeover by bad actors, which is exactly what we're seeing.</p><p>The real answer is better agency, not abdication of it.</p></div>— Gaurav Sharma (@gsharm1) <a href="https://twitter.com/gsharm1/status/1364356821104885760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>Usefulness</h2>



<p>The other argument often made is that Bitcoin has no actual use despite all the money flowing into it and other cryptocurrencies. Patrick explains this well:</p>



<blockquote><p>I don’t hold any position in cryptocurrencies. I continue to believe that they’ve produced substantially no value in the world. I’m not philosophically opposed to shorting them to zero, but the mechanics of doing that are non-trivial.</p><p>…</p><p>My intense skepticism of cryptocurrencies is probably the issue on which I am most in disagreement with many close friends, professional acquaintances, and some of the smartest people I know. That is part of the reason why the hobby of peeling back onion layers here is so engrossing: people really, passionately believe that there is <em>something here.</em> I’m intellectually curious. The thing people have told me exists should <em>smash</em> my interest buttons: <em>programmable money</em>! How could I not look!?</p><p>I have looked, quite a bit. I have not found a good use case yet, or the revolutionary technology advances that my friends tell me exist, but I have found some frauds.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Institutions</h2>



<p>Mark Cuban quips:</p>



<figure><div>
<div></div>
</div></figure>



<p>By whales, one usually means very wealthy individuals or more often institutions who can buy $millions or even $billions worth of bitcoin, like Square did. Yet:</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>As of yet, no answers. Meanwhile I’ll assume Bitcoin is not only unethical but impracticle too. Can you imagine Apple or Tesla having an asset that’s expected to go up and down in orders of magnitude through the years on their balance sheet?</p>



<p>Yet according to Bitcoin proponent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor">Michael Saylor</a>, you’re expected to believe this is exactly where things are headed:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you are interested in the legal considerations firms face while integrating <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> into their corporate strategy, you are not alone.   We have professionals from more than 1400 firms joining us tomorrow for this discussion.  There is still time for your legal team to attend. <a href="https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP">https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP</a></p>— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1356712865827332099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The inconsistencies in what’s claimed here just don’t add up. It’s either a stable balance-sheet worthy asset or a strange growing/shrinking cash pile – it can’t possibly be both.</p>



<h2>Drag forces</h2>



<p>Promoters of Bitcoin often mention how Bitcoin went up approximately by 100x during the last cycle before collapsing at a higher base level, and that this cycle will continue. What they forget to take into account is drag forces: it’s easier to find the first 1% who are attracted to such schemes, but harder to find the next 10%.</p>



<p>To assume Bitcoin will continue to grow a similar amount to that in previous cycles disingenuously assumes there’s no saturation point re: interest in Bitcoin, and people will keep paying ever higher prices. In reality, interest levels off. People won’t buy Bitcoin for $100k as casually they will for $100.</p>



<p>There’s an expectation by some Bitcoin proponents that the wealthy (billionaires, etc) will flock to Bitcoin and this will continue to drive up the price. But imagine you actually are a billionaire – why would you want to participate in a chaotic get-rich scheme in the first place? Instead, it’s some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/1358126195926331393?s=20">poorest, desperate and most vulnerable </a>that are targeted to and impacted by such schemes.</p>



<h2>Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)</h2>



<p>There’s a reason why Bitcoin proponents often use the phrase “have fun staying poor” when challenged with logic and they have no logical answers. That phrase is not a statement aimed at the rich (who aren’t poor to begin with). Rather it’s designed to intimidate regular folks into buying Bitcoin in fear of missing out.</p>



<p>What’ll likely be be Bitcoin’s undoing is exactly what’s causing the current bubble – greed. Those piling in primarily for “number goes up” (the overwhelmingly majority of buyers) will just as quickly sell when “number goes down”. Bitcoin isn’t a stable store of value, it’s a macro pump and dump scheme.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The reason I’m reluctant to go back into Bitcoin is that given what it’s turned into (a modified ponzi scheme), as much as I’d like to make money for investing in the right things, Bitcoin does not seem to me like a right thing. Rather it leaves one in the position of just hoping some <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp">greater fools</a> pay an even higher price further down the line for what is otherwise quite literally a useless asset, so that one earns a profit. Isn’t that how Ponzi schemes work?</p>



<p>Lastly, reading this reddit post for me may have been the nail in the coffin:</p>

February 24, 2021 | https://manuelmoreale.com/emails | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://manuelmoreale.com/emails">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/"></a><p>In a world filled with chats and forums and apps, emails are still one of the most useful tools to communicate with people. I’m not an email power user by any means. My volume of emails is very low so this blog post may not be for you if you’re one of those people who receives hundreds of emails every day and uses dozens of smart folders and filters. If instead you’re looking for a simple way to handle emails this post could be a useful one.</p>
<p>Few premises: I’m on Mac and this post is Mac oriented. So if you’re on Windows or Linux, sorry. You could maybe achieve something similar using a different email clients though. Also, both my emails are hosted by Google. I have one traditional Gmail account for personal stuff and one GSuite account for work related things. Which means the two inboxes are 15 and 30GB respectively and I don’t have to worry about space. With that in mind let’s get started.</p>
<h2>My history with email clients</h2>
<p>I tried a bunch of different clients during the years. I went through Sparrow before it was bought and killed by Google, I tried AirMail, Polymail, Unibox and Spark. To be honest with you, I wasn’t happy with any of those clients. Don’t get me wrong, they were ok and did the job but I’m a weird person and I like simplicity. Sometimes I want a tool that does one thing and nothing more. Smart inbox is nice, filters are great but I don’t want to use them. I want to get my emails, read them, reply to them and archive them. And that’s it.</p>
<h2>My current setup</h2>
<p>My current inbox looks like this</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Yes, it’s quite minimal. I want my inbox empty. If there’s something in there, it means I have to do something about it. And that something is either archive it or reply to it. But before I dive into the ins and outs of this set up let’s see how you can set it up.</p>
<h2>The Settings</h2>
<p>The first thing you wanna do is set up Mail as your default client and turn off all notifications. I hate notifications. I don’t want my mac to ding or ring at random. Plus, no email is really urgent in my world. You can adjust this according to your preference though. That’s up to you.</p>

<p>As for the font, I like to use San Francisco but that’s also a personal preference. Size is also up to you. 14 is the sweet spot in my opinion.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Next up we have viewing options. A couple of things here. You don’t want to use the classic layout because it need too much horizontal space. You can however turn on the contact photos as well as the list preview.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>I have both turned off because I don’t need to see pictures and I don’t need to have a preview of the message. I want to open the email to see what’s inside and then decide what to do.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Next you want to set Archive as the default action to the discard move. This will allow you to swipe left on the message to show the archive icon. As I said at the beginning, I archive everything since I have plenty of space available in my inbox.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>You also want to have the most recent message at the top. As for the option when you’re composing a new message, I’m not a fan of quoting the entire message every time so I turned off that option.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>With the settings done, we can now move into the <strong>View</strong> options and hide everything that’s not necessary. You want to hide the tab bar, sort the messages by date and have the most recent at the top, hide the Mailbox list, disable the Message Filter and hide the Favorites Bar.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>You do want to to keep the Toolbar though because that’s where the search fields lives. We can now move to the toolbar. If you right click on it you can customize it. As you can see from the picture below, I deleted everything and the only thing left is the search field. And in order to have the search field centered inside the window I added two spacer on each side of the search field.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Also make sure to display the icon only. As for the message window, things there are pretty straightforward.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Each message opens in a new window and as you can see from the picture, the only button left in the toolbar is the reply button. I’m not a fan of replying all but you can tweak that based on your needs.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>And that’s pretty much it. You should now have an uber minimal email client. I particularly like it because it’s super focused. If something is in my inbox I need to act on it. And I have only two options available: reply and archive. If I need to get an old email I have a handy search bar always available at the top.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>If you decide to give this setup a go let me know. Also let me know if you have ideas about how to improve it. I'm always happy to try new things.</p></div></div>]]>

                    </figure>

                <section>
                    <p>Cassandra is a popular, tried-and-true NoSQL database that supports key-value wide-column tables. Like any powerful tool, Cassandra has its ideal use cases - in particular, Cassandra excels at supporting write-heavy workloads, while having limitations when supporting read-heavy workloads. Cassandra's eventual consistency model and lack of transactions, multi-table support like joins, subqueries can also limit its usefulness.</p><p>However, using Cassandra as a metadata database for an object storage system introduces significant complexity resulting in data integrity and performance issues at scale - particularly if one wants to use their object store as a primary storage system. Object storage needs are far simpler and different from what Cassandra is built for.</p><p>Because the implications of employing Cassandra as a object storage metadata database were not properly understood, many object storage vendors made it a foundational part of their architecture - unfortunately it keeps them from ever moving past simple archival workloads into the modern workloads that define the future of object storage (AI/ML, analytics, web/mobile applications).</p><p>Let’s explore why in a little more detail.</p><ol><li>Cassandra was never designed to manage file or object storage metadata and it is predictably weak in this regard. It is <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/2.2/cassandra/dml/dmlTransactionsDiffer.html">not ACID compliant</a>. It does not have the rigidity to prevent partially successful writes, dupes, contradictions and the like. Cassandra does not support joins or foreign keys, and consequently does not offer consistency in the ACID sense. Further, there is no capacity to roll back transactions in the event of a failure. <p>While Cassandra supports atomicity and isolation at the row-level, it trades transactional isolation and atomicity for high availability and fast write performance. </p></li><li>Cassandra is categorized as an AP system in CAP. Meaning it trades Consistency for Availability and Partition tolerance. When employing Cassandra as a metadata database for an object store, you can either be fast or consistent - but not both at the same time. <p>Cassandra’s tunable consistency is a compromise, not a feature. Any setting other than <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html">QUORUM or ALL</a> means you are at risk of reading stale data. It is important to apply this consistency setting for both read and write operations in addition to the object data operations performed outside of it. </p><p>In the object storage world, the implication is that you can be good for archival use cases (write once, read very infrequently) or you choose a different architecture. </p></li><li>Similar to the consistency problem, durability guarantee is also a tradeoff between performance and correctness. The storage engine’s default <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/storage_engine.html">commit log</a> is set to sync periodically every 10 seconds. This means you will lose up to 10 seconds worth of latest updates in the event of power failure. The only reasonable way to make Cassandra durable is to use the synchronous batch mode committer which comes with a performance penalty. </li><li>Cassandra’s high-availability guarantee is not suited for erasure coded object stores. With a replication factor of 3 and consistency quorum of 2, Cassandra can only tolerate a single node / drive failure within a replication group. Increasing the replication factor and quorum consistency to 5 or higher serves only to make the meta performance go from bad to worse. Unlike replication, erasure coding can tolerate multiple servers and drives failures in a distributed system. Even if you have configured the erasure code setting to 6 parity (any 6 nodes may fail) in a 16 node setup, you are still limited by the weak link, i.e Cassandra’s replication factor. The ops team is often unaware of these high-availability surprises until it is too late.</li><li>Object storage systems organize the data in a tree structured hierarchical namespace. Since Cassandra does not support a hierarchical key namespace, you will have to build a tree data model on top for each directory prefix and also maintain a flat list for direct lookups without directory walk. Atomically updating multiple tables with batched commit log and full read / write quorum is slow and prone to &nbsp;corruption.</li><li>While objects themselves are immutable, the object storage system is mutable. When you add, remove, overwrite objects and its metadata, apply policies, collect metrics, grant session tokens and rotating credentials, the metadata is always mutating. Cassandra is not designed to handle this level of metadata mutation and definitely not for the primary storage workloads. Long term archival use cases where the objects are large (GBs in size) and infrequently accessed, will work - other use cases will not..<p>The reason is that Cassandra's log structured storage system quickly appends new writes to the end of the log file, but delays the deletes and overwrites with a tombstone marker. Vacuuming these tombstones is an expensive operation, because the actual delete operation is applied by copying the SSTables to a new table sieving the stale entries in the process. This operation has to be performed on all the nodes simultaneously. If you delay vacuuming, excessive tombstones will result in increased read latencies, memory GC pauses and failed queries. Some object storage vendors use an additional Redis database to offload Cassandra’s pressure. Using two databases to manage an object stores metadata is hardly elegant and introduces additional points of failure. &nbsp;</p><p>The biggest gotcha? You won’t see these problems until you are deep into production and it is too late.</p></li><li>Small objects (KB to MB in size) will fill up the metadata drives dedicated to Cassandra much sooner than the data drives. Also small object workloads exacerbate Cassandra’s limitations, because they are sensitive to latency and consistency issues. &nbsp;Some vendors store small objects entirely inside Cassandra to address this problem. At this point, you are merely looking at an S3 proxy on top of Cassandra database. <p>This too is a bad practice. </p><p>If you use your object store for large objects and employ erasure coding and use Cassandra as your data store for small objects and use replication - you have introduced a non-trivial SLA problem. In this approach, data is protected by different guarantees. Given that drives die all the time, the probability of serving an old object or a corrupted object goes up considerably. </p><p>As noted above, your metadata database is now the weak link. Availability, consistency and durability guarantees are only as good as the weakest link. If the weakest link employs replication (three copies) you can only withstand one-node or one drive failure before losing data.</p><p>A counter argument might be to replicate five copies. The result is a massive performance hit and you can still really only withstand two-node or two-drive failure. </p><p>In using replication for small objects and erasure coding for large objects you also undermine the efficiency gains associated with EC. If you only use erasure code for large objects (likely a small percent of your overall object pool) you don’t gain much but increase your exposure considerably.</p></li><li>Employing Cassandra as your metadata database for an object store also introduces a troublesome Java dependency. This in turn can result in bloatware and memory management issues. Cassandra taxes the JVM memory management with constant large scale metadata allocation and mutation resulting in memory exhaustion and garbage collection pauses. </li></ol><p>The obvious takeaway is that it is a lot more complicated to operate a Cassandra cluster than a properly designed object storage system. Cassandra is built for a different purpose and object-storage meta-data is not one of them. The areas where Cassandra struggles are the areas that are core to a performant, scalable and resilient object store.</p><p>The last point is of note - object storage is a natural fit for blob data and that is why Erasure Coding is so effective and efficient. Cassandra is designed for replication. When you use that model for metadata it breaks the object store’s erasure coding advantage (or at the very least makes it brittle and prone to breakage).</p><p><strong>Bottom line. Write your metadata atomically with your object. Never separate them.</strong><br></p><p>We welcome your comments.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Uncle Bob in his book “The clean coder” has a very clear answer to his question:</p>
<p>”<strong>You should plan on working 60 hours per week</strong>. The first 40 hours are for your employer. The remaining 20 are for you. (…) Perhaps you do not want to make that kind of commitment. That’s fine but you should not think of yourself as a professional. Professionals spend time caring for their profession.”</p>
<p>This is a really bad answer and promotes very bad habits in the industry. If you look at how many hours a programmer works on average it will be in the range from 40-60+ hours a week. Very rarely you will find a part-time programmer.</p>
<p>Let’s try to figure out what the correct number is.</p>
<h2>It is harmful to work above 40 hours</h2>
<p>People that constantly working 60 hours are not professional and should consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming you are employed for 40 hours and you work an additional 20 hours - If you would be a freelancer your salary would increase by +50% - however as employee you will probably not be given a pay raise and you will not get any recognition because your extra work is just assumed as the new ‘normal’</li>
<li>You are putting your job as your only priority and will not have time for relationships, friends, family or your own personal interests.</li>
<li>Additionally you are harming other developers. Two developers working 60 hours a week do the same amount of hours as 3 developers working 40 hours a week. You effectively are eliminated a job opening making it more difficult for a junior developer to find a job.</li>
</ul>
<p>I bet you are thinking right now: ”<em>But there is so much to do, I cant work less hours. The project will fail if I do not get all the tasks done. My manager is pressuring me to work long hours</em>”</p>
<p>I am going to let you in on a couple of secrets:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is always a lot of work, the client will always want a new feature, bugfix etc. that is the nature of developing software. In most cases it is not the end of the world if a feature is delivered at a later point in time.</li>
<li>Your managers job is to get the most work out of you for the least cost. If you work more hours for free, hey that’s quite a good deal for the manager in the short term. However great managers will realize that allowing programmers to go home and have a life outside of work will make them more effective at work thus actually improving the projects outcome in the long run.</li>
<li>If you think the project will fail because you are not putting in extra hours, then the projects resources are being miss managed. Management is not aware of the state of the project - You pitching in and doing extra hours, makes the problem worse - as management just believes that the velocity of the project has not changed. You are not signaling to management that the project is not going well and the project cannot continue in this way - they do not know that they are allocating 150% of resources that are available to them. Everything seems to be fine - but in reality management would have to take action to maintain the projects velocity they either have to hire additional people or adjust the deadlines to match the available resources.</li>
<li>And finally the deadline for the project is probably arbitrary. Any project manager knows that things go wrong in a software project. You can assume that there are multiple fallback deadlines. Even if there is the ‘last’ deadline - you are dealing with people and people can be flexible if you communicate with them - also if they already invested months of time and resources into a project, in most cases you do not throw that away immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overtime is sometimes unavoidable, but it always should be a temporary measure, never a permanent state.</p>
<p>It should not become a permanent state because studies have shown that most humans when working more hours just work less efficient. So it is very likely that you can work less hours and achieve the exact same outcome, because you are working more focused.</p>
<p>In short - you should only be working more than 40 hours for a good reason.</p>
<h2>Working for 40 hours is also bad</h2>
<p>If you think you can clock in from 9-5 and just work on your tasks - you will burn out.</p>
<p>You have to stay up to date what is going on in your field. You have to learn multiple programming languages. It is your responsibility as an professional developer.</p>
<p>Managers will not take care of this. Most times they will promise you ‘trainings’, while at the same time they will never have the budget for you to actually attend a training.</p>
<p><em>“But learning a new technology that my employer does not need is just for me”</em></p>
<p>Lets assume you learn an abstract programming language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Piet">Piet</a> - It seems useless for your employer at first, but maybe at your company for the problem that you have to solve this language may be the easiest solution. It also may be that this technology makes the problem harder and you should avoid using it.</p>
<p>No matter the outcome, you the developer will have sharpened your skills have a deeper understanding of the technologies being currently used by contrasting it with the newly learned technology. Additionally you gain knowledge about technologies you might want to consider or avoid in the future. With the side benefit that you are less frustrated at your job because you know your skills are growing.</p>
<p>But without your effort in learning about the technology, your employer cannot make an educated decision and will just go with whatever they have always been using. The manager may not even be aware of this new technology. In the end it is your job to explain to your employer if they should use a technology or not - they relies on their employees to highlight potential benefits/downsides of using any tech.</p>
<p>You have to plan this time, its part of your self management - just as you would plan time for your emails. Its just part of your job, your manager will not tell you to answer emails, its just part of your job to do that, the manager assumes that you know that.</p>
<p>If you only dedicate 40 hours to complete the tasks that your employer gives you, you are neglecting your skills why your employer hired you in the first place - and risk to be replaced.</p>
<h2>Programming for 20 hours from 9-5</h2>
<p>Now lets take a look at my ideal view of how you should spend your 40 hours a week:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 hours is for working on actual tasks</li>
<li>10 hours is for practicing skills and keeping up to date</li>
<li>10 hours is for meetings, email and socializing</li>
</ul>
<p>25% of your time spent on practicing seems excessive. Coding is equally craftmanship and artistic expression. Consider other professions like a concert musician. A Violinist would be practicing for months for a single concert - 99% training and 1% performance. Nobody would say that is excessive.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Practicing skills means actively learning and solving problems it is <strong>not</strong> passively watching for hours YouTube talks or listening to podcasts</p>
<p>Meetings in an organization simply take time a lot of time that you are not spending programming, and many times you get the feeling you were in so many meetings you did not get anything done for the day and clock in an extra hour - however attending meetings is work. you did get something done - you are allowed to go home you may not have done fun things like coding - but you did work.</p>
<p>If you miss a deadline because of meeting then you maybe should reconsider if you should’ve attended that meeting in the first place. nobody’s forcing you to attend every meeting. If your manager complains that you’re not going to attend a meeting then you can explain that you have a deadline to meet – The manager can then decide what is more important. You are the one that has inform your manager about the conflicting responsibilities.</p>
<p>The remaining time you can spend working on tasks and that is if you are lucky around 20 hours.</p>
<h2>But I am passionate about programming</h2>
<p>You can have programming as a hobby even while you’re working in the field. But then you have to treat it as a hobby and you only should do it if you have the time and it gives you joy and satisfaction. - this also means working on your own project - not work related and overall it should be relaxing.</p>
<h2>Quality over Quantity</h2>
<p>It all comes down to quality over quantity. It is better to commit to fewer tasks and deliver them on time and in a good quality than deliver many tasks with bugs. Because the bugs will drastically reduce your development velocity over a long period of time.</p>
<p>And in the end your manager will also be happier because your work output becomes more predictable and reliable. As a bonus the manager does not have to explain to people why the software was created with so many defects and then order overtime to fix them as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Working focused we get you much further then overworking and neglecting your life outside of work.</p>
<h2>There is no correct answer</h2>
<p>You have to think about your personal situation and work the way it suits you.</p>
<p>Take your time to think about your current situation, your capabilities and set your priorities.</p>
<p>Take responsibility and control over how many hours you work. This is an active choice - do not passively just do that what everyone else is doing.</p></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="8.22.8"><div dir="ltr"><div><h3 id="viewer-foo"><span><span>If electric vehicles are to be the future, they'll have to overcome several obstacles </span></span></h3><p id="viewer-fm4jg"><span>There is no doubt that electric vehicles are the future, as the way we get around and produce electricity is transitioning away from fossil fuels, and towards cleaner and greener alternatives.  The entire transport sector accounts for 21% of total CO2 emissions and road travel alone accounts for 15% of total CO2 emissions so getting electric vehicles onto the roads is definitely a priority in tackling the <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-the-solution-to-the-climate-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>climate crisis</u></a>. However, they're not perfect, and they are faced with obstacles that are stopping them from becoming mainstream.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-1gqqg"><span>Choice</span></h2><p id="viewer-9nibn"><span>Because electric vehicles are fairly new, in the grand scheme of things, companies don't yet offer an electric range anywhere near as big as their gas range and not everybody wants the same type of vehicle. Some people want fast vehicles, others need big ones for their kids, and of course for the moment there are still no pickup trucks although many are in the works (like the famous Tesla Cybertruck). So until we have an electric vehicle for every type of driver out there, they simply can't be mainstream because people will always be drawn to the gas car that fits all their needs.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6q717"><span>Cost</span></h2><p id="viewer-aprb2"><span>As usual, it always comes down to the money. Although the cost per mile may be reduced thanks to the price of electricity being lower than that of gas, for electric vehicles to be adopted by the masses, the initial price will need to be reduced. The cheapest electric cars come in at around $30 000 and higher end models can climb well into the $100 000, whereas the initial price of gas cars can be much cheaper. Once again, as electric vehicles become more and more popular, we will start to see much more competitive prices, furthermore, many countries will offer rebates and incentives to encourage you to buy them.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-5ncln"><span>Misconceptions </span></h2><p id="viewer-7j63h"><span>Another obstacle that electric vehicles will have to overcome are their misconceptions! Indeed a lot of information that is exaggerated or even fake is spread about electric vehicles. This leads to unnecessary concerns for potential buyers.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-elr1a"><span>Range</span></h3><p id="viewer-v7a0"><span>Range is often a concern to potential electric vehicle buyers, because gas vehicles are commonly believed to be far superior in this domain which is actually no longer the case. The average gas-powered car can reach up to 482 km (300 miles) on a full tank, whilst most electric models have a range of 200-490 km (124-304 miles) on a single charge so it's now very easy to find an EV with a range that fits your needs. Tesla has even managed to breach 500 miles of range, with the new Model S Plaid+ boasting an incredible 520+ miles on a single charge. In addition, with <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/the-future-of-batteries" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>battery technology</u></a> constantly being improved upon, those numbers can only get better! </span></p><h3 id="viewer-3r74r"><span>Charging Infrastructure </span></h3><p id="viewer-8qmjc"><span>If you do end up in a situation where you're on a long trip and need to recharge your vehicle, you will of course need to find a charging station. Although changing infrastructure is constantly growing, once again people are concerned that they'll have difficulty finding a station, whether it be a Tesla Supercharger, or any other charging network. The truth is that most people only really drive 40-90 km a day, meaning you can just recharge your vehicle at home. Furthermore, maps now clearly show EV charging stations and will help you plan out when and where to stop. </span></p><h3 id="viewer-ci2tu"><span>Charging Speed</span></h3><p id="viewer-3a7pg"><span>Charging speed is also a source of worry to people considering electric vehicles as it is often exaggerated. Depending on the charging network, the charging speed will be very different. For example, a 22kW station can charge cars in about 5h, whereas a 150kW station (like a Tesla Supercharger) can charge cars in under an hour. Furthermore, Elon Musk tweeted on December 21st that the Supercharger network will be available to other car manufacturers in reply to a tweet from MKBHD:</span></p><p id="viewer-bi2ii"><span>On top of that, companies are constantly working on making charging faster and more efficient, Tesla even announced plans for a new Megacharger network in 2017,  that could provide the Semi Trucks (that they announced the same day) with 400 miles (645km) of range in 30 minutes!</span></p><p id="viewer-2epup"><span>Of course you're very rarely going to charge your vehicle to 100%, in normal circumstances you will top up every now and then, or spread out charging on a long journey to comply with bathroom breaks. Moreover, electric vehicles have the benefit of being charged at home over night, meaning you'll rarely even need to top up when doing short distances.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-dv8l4"><span>Overloading the Grid</span></h3><p id="viewer-bj766"><span>Finally there are rumours that, with all these new electric vehicles needing charging at once, the electrical grid would overload. This is, however, untrue and exaggerated as electric vehicles will indeed not have a big enough impact to overload the grid. In fact, the adoption of electric vehicles may even help the grid with the introduction of <a href="https://blog.wallbox.com/en/why-bidirectional-charging-is-the-next-big-thing-for-ev-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Bidirectional charging</u></a> (or “Two-way” Charging). This would allow for electric car batteries to provide electricity to the grid via a DC to AC converter system usually embedded in the EV charger. Vehicle to grid (V2G) can be used to help balance and settle local, regional or national energy needs via smart charging. It allows EVs to charge during off-peak hours and give back to the grid during peak hours, when there is extra energy demand. With careful planning and the right infrastructure, parked and plugged-in EVs could become mass power banks, stabilizing the electric grids of the future</span></p><h2 id="viewer-9dgv5"><span>Bottom Line</span></h2><p id="viewer-7r1k5"><span>The bottom line is, electric vehicles still have a few obstacles to overcome if they're to become mainstream, but at the rate that technology is improving and with the amount of money being invested into electric vehicles increasing, it shouldn't be too long before we start to see a considerable shift away from gas and towards electric.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-83cqm"><span>

February 24, 2021 | https://blog.rebased.pl/2021/02/22/redis-rate-limiter.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.rebased.pl/2021/02/22/redis-rate-limiter.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      
      <p>At <a href="https://rebased.pl/">Rebased</a> we have an internal time tracking project called Harmonogram.
Its backend is built in Ruby on Rails.
It started as a playground for new hires to get used to company culture and conventions, but over time grew into a fully-functional tool.
When I joined, the application was already being used internally and we were hitting interesting performance problems.
One of them was reaching the rate limit of Toggl API calls.
And since this was my first week at the company, I was tasked with solving this issue.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The Toggl documentation recommended sending requests at most every second in order to avoid hitting the limit – which we were already doing in a naive way, so the solution wouldn’t be as easy as adding <code>sleep 1</code> to every request.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>page</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
  <span>report_data</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>[</span><span>'data'</span><span>])</span>
  <span>page</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

  <span>break</span> <span>if</span> <span>report_data</span><span>.</span><span>size</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>response</span><span>[</span><span>'total_count'</span><span>]</span>
  <span>sleep</span> <span>1</span> <span># not enough :(</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After looking around, I’ve realised the code above was called from many places and processes: the web server, manual Rake tasks, background jobs and cron.
This made the <code>sleep 1</code> solution ineffective.
I needed something that would synchronise all of these callers in a way that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>doesn’t introduce too many changes to the existing code,</li>
  <li>doesn’t add any new technologies to the current stack,</li>
  <li>guarantees that there’s at least a 1 second delay between calls.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to pull this off I’d need to setup a semaphore shared by multiple Ruby processes – and a mechanism that would block API calls until at least a second has passed since the last one.
I needed a place to store and share information about those calls.
Redis seemed like a perfect solution, mainly because we can setup keys that expire after a given amount of miliseconds – which would allow us to store a key that expires after one second and have other callers wait until it expires.
Luckily we were already using Redis for background jobs, so I wouldn’t be adding new dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>To keep the changes to a minimum I’ve decided to create a new class.
It should allow us to execute a block of code with a globally limited rate, but without having to know how that happens.
Ideally we’d initialize that “limiter” and inject it where needed, keeping the rate limiting separate from other logic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>page</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># now using rate limiter instead of sleeping</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>rate_limiter</span><span>.</span><span>with_limited_rate</span> <span>{</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>report_data</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>[</span><span>'data'</span><span>])</span>
  <span>page</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

  <span>break</span> <span>if</span> <span>report_data</span><span>.</span><span>size</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>response</span><span>[</span><span>'total_count'</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we assume that the rate limiter works as needed, this should solve our problem.
But something doesn’t look right.
Rate limiting should be a responsibility of the client.
It’s there to keep us separated from the low-level details of communicating with the API.
That includes rate limiting.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Client</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>,</span> <span>rate_limiter: </span><span>TogglApi</span><span>::</span><span>RateLimiter</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>)</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>@rate_limiter</span> <span>=</span> <span>rate_limiter</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>:)</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>rate_limiter</span><span>.</span><span>with_limited_rate</span> <span>{</span> <span>@client</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>Response</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># ...</span>

  <span>private</span>

  <span>attr_reader</span> <span>:rate_limiter</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This looks better.
Now the API client deals with rate limiting and we can simplify our example from earlier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>some_method</span>
  <span>page</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># no need to worry about rate limiting now</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
    <span>report_data</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>[</span><span>'data'</span><span>])</span>
    <span>page</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>break</span> <span>if</span> <span>report_data</span><span>.</span><span>size</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>response</span><span>[</span><span>'total_count'</span><span>]</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>client</span>
  <span>@client</span> <span>||=</span> <span>Client</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>toggl_api_token</span><span>,</span> <span>rate_limiter: </span><span>RateLimiter</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-rate-limiter">The rate limiter</h2>

<p>Now that we have an idea of how the limiter interface should look like, we can talk about the implementation details.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>RateLimiter</span>

      <span>end</span>

      <span>sleep</span> <span>seconds_until_next_slot</span><span>(</span><span>retries</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>yield</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>private</span>

  <span>attr_reader</span> <span>:redis</span><span>,</span> <span>:interval</span><span>,</span> <span>:timeout</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The main element is the <code>with_limited_rate</code> that ends with a <code>yield</code> call.
It calls the private <code>claim_time_slot!</code> in a loop until it either succeeds or runs out of time.
We give it a limited amount of time because we don’t want it to hang forever, causing timeouts in other places.
In case of a timeout we throw a custom error with data for debugging.
Inside the loop, there’s a <code>sleep</code> call with a calculated delay in seconds.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>def</span> <span>claim_time_slot!</span>
    <span>redis</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>REDIS_KEY</span><span>,</span> <span>'locked'</span><span>,</span> <span>px: </span><span>(</span><span>interval</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>).</span><span>round</span><span>,</span> <span>nx: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>claim_time_slot!</code> method is straightforward.
It calls the Redis instance to set the value <code>'locked'</code> on the <code>REDIS_KEY</code> key.
This value will expire after <code>px</code> milliseconds and <code>nx: true</code> means it will only set the value if it doesn’t exist yet.
The return value of <code>redis.set</code> is truthy when the key was sucessfully created and falsy otherwise.
In other words, if no other instance of the rate limiter called <code>redis.set</code> in the last second, then <code>claim_time_slot!</code> will return true and the block passed to <code>with_limited_rate</code> will be called.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>def</span> <span>seconds_until_next_slot</span><span>(</span><span>retries</span><span>)</span>
    <span>ttl</span> <span>=</span> <span>redis</span><span>.</span><span>pttl</span><span>(</span><span>REDIS_KEY</span><span>)</span>
    <span>ttl</span> <span>=</span> <span>ttl</span><span>.</span><span>negative?</span> <span>?</span> <span>interval</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span> <span>:</span> <span>ttl</span>
    <span>ttl</span> <span>+=</span> <span>calculate_next_slot_offset</span><span>(</span><span>retries</span><span>)</span>
    <span>ttl</span> <span>/</span> <span>1000.0</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># Calculates an offset between 10ms and 50ms to avoid hitting the key right before it expires.</span>
  <span># As the number of retries grows, the offset gets smaller to prioritize earlier requests.</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>calculate_next_slot_offset</span><span>(</span><span>retries</span><span>)</span>
    <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span> <span>-</span> <span>[</span><span>retries</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>].</span><span>min</span><span>].</span><span>max</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>seconds_until_next_slot</code> is more interesting.
It uses the <code>pttl</code> method that returns the current TTL (time to live) of a given key, in miliseconds.
At this point we know that another instance of the limiter has claimed a time slot.
And we want to figure out how long we have to wait.
It is possible though that the key no longer exists because it’s just expired.
In that situation the returned value is negative and we replace it with a full interval to avoid unexpected race conditions or going through retries without waiting.
Then we add a small offset to the TTL, convert it to seconds and return the calculated value to be used in <code>sleep</code>.</p>

<p>Why not ask for seconds in the first place if we’re converting them anyway?
Asking Redis for TTL in seconds will return a rounded value. By asking for miliseconds we can convert them to fractions of a second.</p>

<p>What’s the point of <code>calculate_next_slot_offset(retries)</code>?
This is a trick that will allow us to prioritize calls that have been waiting for a slot longer. A kind of scheduler, if you will.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>calculate_next_slot_offset(0) # =&gt; 50
calculate_next_slot_offset(5) # =&gt; 45
calculate_next_slot_offset(10) # =&gt; 40
calculate_next_slot_offset(15) # =&gt; 35
calculate_next_slot_offset(50) # =&gt; 10
calculate_next_slot_offset(100) # =&gt; 10
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Calls with higher <code>retries</code> count will get smaller offset and therefore have a higher chance of “claiming” a time slot before others.
Given a 1s interval and offset values ranging from 10 to 50, we will be able to prioritize callers with timeouts of up to ~40s.</p>

<p>The 10ms minimal value is there to make sure we don’t hit the key just before it expires and miss an empty slot.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>With the rate limiter implemented and the client configured to use it, we can stop worrying about receiving errors from the Toggl API.
But it’s not ready for release just yet.
We still have to write unit tests and make sure they don’t take too long to run.
Stay tuned for part 2, where we’ll do just that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile – <a href="https://github.com/musialik/redis-rate-limiter">a working demo of the rate limiter</a>!</p>

<p>This solution is a version of a distributed lock, you can <a href="https://redis.io/topics/distlock">read more about that on the Redis website</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Paavo contacted me about starting RecruitLab (we called it <em>bestrecruitment</em> then) when his <a href="http://brandem.ee/">employer branding agency</a> could not find a suitable applicant tracking system. They signed with Bullhorn initially but found some promised key features missing.</p>
<p>Within ~2 months we launched our MVP and signed our first client - the agency.</p>
<p>When entering an established (enterprise) software niche, "do one thing well" does not work. You have to do a thing well, but you also have to do a lot of other things good enough - the essentials. In the ATS space, for example, the essentials are applicant management, e-mail messaging, job board integrations, tools for GDPR compliance. Without those features, your software is just not that useful.</p>
<p>We spent the first 6 months pumping out these essential features - at a fast pace. As soon as one was deemed acceptable we moved on to the next one.</p>
<p>In retrospect, maybe the strategy to reach approximate feature parity real fast was not the optimal one. Maybe, if we had just cerebrated hard enough, we could have found some product-market fit with one of our <a href="https://get.recruitlab.co.uk/p/job-builder">unique features</a> as a standalone product.</p>
<p>Bugs don't happen when your SaaS is making $$$ while you sleep. Bugs happen when you change or build features. When you build many features, you get many bugs. During our 6-month building-spree, we started having discussions about our software quality. Not on an abstract level, but in the concrete "some clients are afraid to use some features" sense. Very bad, an existential threat.</p>
<p>We slowed down, held meetings and reflected. Our policy of zero tolerance for bugs was born and we wholeheartedly committed to it.</p>
<p>This does not mean that I stopped building buggy software or Paavo &amp; Marie started catching all bugs in staging. It is a culture of empathy towards our users. We try harder - we test more (both manually and automated). I put more emphasis on non-happy paths, handling faults. Bugs still slip through though, but we do our best to document and understand them, create tickets. When planning development, fixing bugs is always our top priority. We don't build new features before old ones are bug-free (to our knowledge).</p>
<p>The culture shift from yee-haw development to a more careful mode has paid off well for <a href="https://recruitlab.co.uk/">RecruitLab</a>. There are fewer fires to put out. The more diligent testing and development might even be a net time-saver due to fewer distractions from incidents and customer support.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Careful what you call it</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">I always hear people say they have 'writer's block'. I have been writing poetry consistently for almost four years now and I can't say I've ever experienced it. Not in the way that other people have, or mean when they say it, anyway. Do I have periods of time where I write less? Sure! But I don't label it or complain about it, in my head or to anyone else. And I think this is part of the reason I do not struggle. I've never worried about those periods of time where I wrote less. I know from my own experience that those phases pass, and are not something to worry about. I always write again.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe some people really do struggle with some sort of mental blockage for months on end - and if that happens and it feels uncomfortable, I feel for those people. I would recommend not labelling it, for one, and having some faith in your own ability as a writer. Phases with less writing are normal, and should not be viewed as negative. As you'll learn from this post, there are many actions a writer can take if they do experience block and it bothers them, but not letting it bother you seems like a good start to me.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Revisit your old work</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If I ever did feel like I hadn't written anything groundbreaking in a while, I would revisit my old work. Specifically, not just reading it, but actually rewriting it by hand in a notebook. For me, this worked some sort of magic, getting my brain to 'think in poetry' again. Sometimes my brain is in poetry mode, and sometimes it's not. This was one way I discovered I am able to get it to change lanes and 'activate' poetry mode, and I've used it successfully many times. I have also started making visual representations of my poetry, in the form of collage art. This gives me a new way to interact with my existing art, and gets the creative juices flowing as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Think about some ways you can revisit and reimage your existing body of work. You can copy it by hand to simply reconnect, try rewriting it and see if you like it better, or on the opposite end of the spectrum, try recreating it in different mediums. We should feel safe to explore and play, fail, and find happy surprises in doing so. I have created some really interesting songs and collages that I really loved, just because I decided to sit down and do the work.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Get out of your head (and the house)</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you haven't felt like writing in a while, I'd recommend exploring a new place. Or taking a long walk down a slightly different route than normal. Go to a gallery or see a film outside your normal genre. We need to give our brains fuel for creativity, and shake things up. It creates new neural pathways.</p><p dir="ltr">This is best supported and explained by an article from Fast Company:&nbsp;<i>"Perception and imagination are linked because the brain uses the same neural circuits for both functions. Imagination is like running perception in reverse. In order to think creatively, you must develop new neural pathways and break out of the cycle of experience-dependent categorization. You need a novel stimulus, such as a new piece of information or an unfamiliar environment, to jolt the attentional systems awake. The more radical the change, the greater the likelihood of fresh insights."&nbsp;</i>(<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1007044/neuroscience-sheds-new-light-creativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>)</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Meditate</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">I started meditating at the end of 2016, and since then, I have been writing poetry and lyrics steadily and without much pause. I honestly feel like something changed in my own brain chemistry on the day of my first meditation, which as I later discovered, was quite a special experience. It felt afterwards like an eternal tap of creativity had been turned on, and I can tell you that it has never really stopped. I was changed that day. I had been exploring Buddhism and reading about mindfulness and meditation around that time, so I had already started to purposefully try to become more open-minded. I had been feeling unrest within myself too though, and I felt driven to sit down and meditate for the first time ever that Sunday.</p><p dir="ltr">I saw on my bed, with a candle lit on the windowsill and made sure I was very comfortable. I focused on sitting very still, and relaxing my entire body. This is an alternative to focusing on breath, if you find that doesn't work for you. You'll find your breath actually takes care of itself anyway, with this approach. Soon, I felt my perceptions of the room changing. Although my eyes were closed, I didn't feel like I was in the room anymore. I felt my body slowly disintegrate, and felt only my consciousness floating where my head should be. The space around me expanded, and was dark, but beautiful, like a galaxy of pureness. Like I was IN the source. I could hear my own thoughts, but they were&nbsp;<i>very</i>&nbsp;far away compared to normal, and they didn't bother me. They existed, and so did I - but we were separate. I remember thinking, wow - if anyone walks in the room right now, I don't know if I'll even be able to move right now! It was as if I was in a beautiful, miraculous trance.</p><p dir="ltr">The experience itself was something I learned to not chase after to get again - we should meditate for the sake of it, not to regain a particular experience or feeling. But in a way it did give me a bar to shoot for with future meditations, as long as I didn't hold onto it too tightly. There's also research that shows that meditation can stimulate creativity. An article on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mindful.org/does-meditation-boost-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mindful.org</a> cites some of these studies, mentioning that "meditation increases cognitive flexibility and reduces cognitive rigidity which are critical to the creative process". The article also says that "the ability to observe is closely related to openness to experience, a personality trait that several studies have shown to be one of the most robust indicators of creative success."</p><p dir="ltr">This also relates back to being open when you're experimenting with your art in different ways, because I believe that this kind of patience and openness is how we uncover our greatest works. Don't be afraid to create a bunch of things you don't like at first - that's a&nbsp;<i>much&nbsp;</i>better rite of passage to adhere to than being able to say you had writer's block. People don't care that you had it - they care how and that you overcame it.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Read more</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When I'm in a period of less writing, I take the opportunity to catch up on reading. I always have a stack of poetry books I still need to read (because I literally cannot stop ordering them), and I read as widely as I can to keep my mind open, curious and inspired. A couple of books I started years ago and need to finish are <i>Master and Margarita</i>&nbsp;by Mikhail Bulgakov and&nbsp;<i>Nausea</i> by Jean-Paul Sartre. I found them to be difficult to read, but their topics are fascinating - surrealist and existentialist. Those are the themes of my art and writing. I'm highly challenged by these texts, and I learn so much by reading as widely as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">I purchased a thick collection of poems by nobel prize winning poet Louise Gluck recently and I'm terrified of it. I call it (for want of a better phase)&nbsp;<i>high brow poetry</i>&nbsp;because I read a few and they went over my head. I didn't understand what was so wonderful about them. The poems are from across her collection from between 1962 - 2012 and the book has over 600 pages (!!), so clearly the woman is prolific, and she won a nobel prize. I need to discover what's so wonderful about her writing and I'm willing to do it. I'm sure I will learn something about myself in the process too.</p></div></div>]]>

I believe exceptions and <code>try/catch</code> statements are overused. Most of the time, it isn’t obvious what a method might throw and when. Edge cases should be treated with the same amount of caution, if not more, than the rest of the code, yet they are rendered invisible by error-handling mechanisms that hide failures instead of highlighting them.</p><p id="9aad">In this blog post, I will showcase some functional programming techniques, namely monads, monad transformers and Cats MTL, that can help you deal with failure, in a way that makes it clearly visible. I will also cover the separation of technical failure and business edge cases to keep business logic where it belongs: at the heart of your software. Prior knowledge of the aforementioned concepts is not required, as I will attempt to define them along the way. Be aware though that these definitions neither exhaustive nor the most rigorous. There are as many ways of explaining monads as they have use cases, error handling is just one of them. For a broader definition of monads, I recommend <a href="https://kubuszok.com/2018/different-ways-to-understand-a-monad/#monad" rel="noopener">this article by Mateusz Kubuszok</a>.</p><p id="7724">This article is essentially a more in-depth version of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WXgEGbf0iQ&amp;t=387s" rel="noopener">talk on Cats MTL I’ve given at the 2020 Typelevel Summit</a>. If you’re looking for a more condensed introduction to monad transformers and functional error handling, consider watching the talk instead :</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Talk on Cats MTL I’ve given at the 2020 Typelevel Summit</figcaption></figure><p id="1862">It is common practice, in object-oriented programming, to deal with errors using exceptions and <code>try/catch</code> statements. The way they work is familiar to most developers: something goes wrong, you <code>throw</code> an object that represents the issue, and the object will propagate across the entire call stack, until either a <code>catch</code> block is met, or the application shuts down.</p><p id="e444">This mechanism is convenient and has made is easy to implement common error handling strategies:</p><ul><li id="8253">The way methods can choose to either <code>catch</code> an exception or escalate it forms a <em>chain of delegation</em>, in which supervising methods are responsible for the errors of their subordinates. In a way, exceptions mimic the behavior of hierarchies we can find all around us. Like many OOP concepts, they first seem easier to understand by comparison with the real world.</li><li id="8bb1">The fact that an uncaught exception will eventually shut down the application means it’s easy to implement fatal exceptions: just let them run free. This is surely way more convenient that explicitly calling <code>exit</code> when you need to. Right?</li></ul><p id="5278">But this convenience does not compensate for the risks and mental overhead exceptions produce. When overused, exceptions introduce complexity and potential bugs to the code base, which all come from this single flaw: exceptions are invisible.</p><p id="5d53">When you look at the signature of a method, you cannot know for certain whether it can fail and under which circumstances. Annotating the method with a comment that says “be careful, this might throw these exceptions” is considered a best practice in many languages, and some have a conventional way of doing it, like <code>@throws</code> in Java. But we’ve all witnessed methods that would throw in production without any prior notice, or with annotations that would lie to our face. After all, the compiler does not compel me into telling the truth in comments, only proper code review does. People run out of time, get neglectful, forget comments here and there, and there you have it: uncaught exception in production.</p><p id="31e0">Often, business logic gets added as the software evolves, not everyone is properly informed, obsolete documentation is left behind.</p><pre><span id="e6cf">/**<br>* This never throws, trust me.<br>*/<br><em>def</em> computeDiscountedPrice(originalPrice: Float, discountPercent: Float) = {<br>  <em>if</em> (discountPercent &gt; 75) {<br>    // If you're going to document errors poorly, <br>    // you might as well make sure your messages are cryptic and unhelpful<br>    <em>throw</em> <em>new</em> RuntimeException("Can't apply discount")<br>  } <em>else</em> {<br>    originalPrice - (originalPrice * discountPercent / 100)<br>  }<br>}</span></pre><p id="0d31">In fact, the only way to know for sure the circumstances under which a method may throw is to inspect its implementation and the implementation of all the methods therein recursively. I hope you can get a feel of the ridiculous mental overhead this introduces, particularly in large code bases. When I’m implementing a feature, I should be able to understand the existing code by looking at, and trust what I’m looking at. I should be able to do that without fear of unknown edge cases and unadvertised side effects sneaking behind my back.</p><p id="ee7e">This, for me, is one of the main reasons why functional programming is so compelling. FP is, among other things, about trusting what you see. While the exact definition of <em>functional programming</em> is still subject to some debate, one well-established characteristic is to maximize the use of functions in the mathematical sense. These functions are</p><ul><li id="9116">referentially transparent, or <em>side-effect free</em>, which means they only bind some input to some output, i.e., they do nothing more than suggested by their signature</li><li id="4321">total, which means they are defined for the entire set of arguments they may receive, i.e., they do nothing less than advertised either</li></ul><p id="fc56">Together, these characteristics ensure that you can understand the code at hand quickly, and refactor it with confidence.</p><p id="1451">So clearly, methods that throw exceptions don’t fit this definition. Throwing exceptions usually means failing on a particular subset of arguments, or under specific circumstances, which breaks the rule of totality. We need another way of modeling errors, and I believe the frustration caused by traditional error handling patterns alone is enough to motivate the learning of something else entirely.</p><p id="f55b">So, if not exceptions, what then?</p><p id="f036">To make the invisible errors visible again, we need to stop encoding them as exceptions and start encoding them as regular data. We need a way of showcasing the error cases of our methods directly in their signatures, so they don’t surprise anyone anymore, and we need a way of composing error-prone code safely, because we’re not writing our entire application in a single function, right?</p><p id="2033">One of the ways we can turn errors into data is by using <code>Option</code> to model the potential absence of value, and <code>Either</code> to model computations that may fail while associating additional data to the failure. I will introduce some examples of using these structures to handle errors, but I won’t dwell on them too much,</p><p id="f992">Let’s bring our first example back. If we were to refuse the user a discount in certain cases, instead of throwing an exception, we can expand the return type of our function by using an <code>Option</code> instead.</p><pre><span id="a1a0">/**<br>* This never throws, for real this time.<br>*/<br><em>def</em> computeDiscountedPrice(originalPrice: Float, discountPercent: Float): Option[Float] = {<br>  <em>if</em> (discountPercent &gt; 75) None<br>  <em>else</em> Some(originalPrice - (originalPrice * discountPercent / 100))<br>}</span></pre><p id="de0e">This time, the function never throws. Instead, it returns a data type that encodes optionality, leaving the caller responsible for handling every possible case (and if they don’t, the compiler will warn them)</p><pre><span id="4154"><em>val</em> validDiscount = computeDiscountedPrice(999.95F, 20.0F)    // Some(799.9600219726562)<br><em>val</em> invalidDiscount = computeDiscountedPrice(999.95F, 77.00F) // None</span></pre><p id="745a">Great! No more exceptions blowing up in our faces. Now I know that sometimes this can fail, and I will adapt my code accordingly. But in what circumstances exactly? <code>Option</code> doesn’t give us any detail as to why a value is absent, it just is, deal with it. In some cases it is desirable to convey additional information regarding the nature of the error. For these situations, using an <code>Either</code> instead allows us to fail with a particular value, as demonstrated by the next example:</p><pre><span id="8611"><em>def</em> computeDiscountedPrice(originalPrice: Float, discountPercent: Float): Either[String, Float] = {<br>  <em>if</em> (discountPercent &gt; 75) Left("The discount cannot exceed 75%, that would ruin us!")<br>  <em>else</em> Right(originalPrice - (originalPrice * discountPercent / 100))<br>}</span><span id="24d5"><em>val</em> validDiscount = computeDiscountedPrice(999.95F, 20.0F)     <br>// Right(799.9600219726562)<br><em>val</em> invalidDiscount = computeDiscountedPrice(999.95F, 77.00F)  <br>// Left(The discount cannot exceed 75%, that would ruin us!)</span></pre><p id="9912">When we want to enforce a particular condition, there’s even a shorter way of doing it:</p><pre><span id="5aa8"><em>def</em> computeDiscountedPrice(originalPrice: Float, discountPercent: Float): Either[String, Float] =<br>  // Either.cond requires a boolean<br>  Either.cond(<br>    discountPercent &lt;= 75,<br>    // When true, return this wrapped in a Right <br>    originalPrice - (originalPrice * discountPercent / 100),<br>    // When false, return this on the left side instead<br>    "The discount cannot exceed 75%, that would ruin us!"<br>  )</span></pre><p id="89e5">Note that I chose a <code>String</code> as my error type on the left side, but I could have chosen any other type. In practice, I would argue against using <code>String</code> on the left side, and use a sealed type instead, something I will do in further examples. There are two main reasons for this:</p><ul><li id="8f5f">First, there is no way to enforce exhaustivity when matching against strings. This means the compiler will be able to tell when you haven’t handled <em>any error</em>, but not that you haven’t handled <em>all the errors</em>. Sealed types give you this additional safety.</li><li id="6b81">Secondly, recall how I like my function signature to tell as much as possible? Well, in that case, I know that the method may fail with a message, which is definitely an improvement, but because a <code>String</code> is a very versatile structure, I still have to look at the implementation to know what this message may be. If I use a type purposefully crafted to model the edge cases of my domain, the name of the type itself can tell me a lot about the nature of the error. Let …</li></ul></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2021-02-24</small>
        <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik/status/1357226010215911425">asked my network on Twitter</a> about noting ideas quickly and got a lot of good responses. One mentioned saving them in Telegram. I don’t think I want to do specifically that but I do want a minimum friction way of noting ideas for later review and refinement. And sending them to a Telegram chat would be quite nice. So I started on the path of something like a note-taking system using Telegram for ingesting quick notes. And I want to share the satisfaction I felt with seeing the near real-time way that it works.</p>
<p>I’ll show some of the process I went through so you can repeat it for your own needs but the repo is open if you want to see where I’ve taken it since. You can find it as <a href="https://github.com/lawik/noted">lawik/noted</a> on GitHub. This guide recreates a simpler approach based off of what I learnt setting that up.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-project">Setting up your project</h2>
<p>I’m using Elixir and Phoenix with LiveView. You need to have the Phoenix project generator installed to follow along, you can follow the Phoenix installation instructions to get it.</p>

  

<p>It should create your project, you can certainly name it something different than <code>noted</code>. I left Ecto in because you’ll likely want it at some point though I won’t use it in this post.</p>
<h2 id="some-initial-setup">Some initial setup</h2>
<p>In <code>lib/noted/application.ex</code> I comment out the <code>Noted.Repo</code> because we’re not using the DB.</p>
<p>In <code>mix.exs</code> for deps I add:</p>

  <div data-file="mix.exs">
  <p>mix.exs</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir">    <span>..</span>
      {<span>:telegram</span>, <span>git</span>: <span>"https://github.com/visciang/telegram.git"</span>, <span>tag</span>: <span>"0.7.0"</span>},
      <span># Gun mismatch with telegram and cowboy</span>
      {<span>:cowlib</span>, <span>"~&gt; 2.7"</span>, <span>override</span>: true}
    <span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>The cowlib thing has to do with some weirdness in the telegram library deps. But adding this should allow you to do <code>mix deps.get</code> and have it work.</p>
<h2 id="get-yourself-a-telegram-bot">Get yourself a Telegram bot</h2>
<p>So get situated with a Telegram account and add <a href="https://t.me/BotFather">The Botfather (Telegram link)</a> as someone to talk to and that’s Telegrams bot for creating bots. Very meta. Pretty convenient.</p>
<p>You write <code>/newbot</code> to him and he’ll guide you through the rest. You’ll receive a secret that you should squirrel away and we’ll use it as a an API key for running our bot.</p>
<p>You’re going to want a convenient client to test things as well. I’m using the MacOS desktop client on this machine, it is nice and native.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-bot">Minimum Viable Bot</h2>
<p>It needs to be self-aware. So let’s make that happen. To protect the bot token I put it in a file in my home dir called <code>.mybotcredentials</code> or something similar. This file is just:</p>

  <div data-file="~/.mybotcredentials">
  <p>~/.mybotcredentials</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="shell">export TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET<span>=</span><span>"my_secret_goes_here"</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>And before running the server I do: <code>source ~/.mybotcredentials</code></p>
<p>This prevents me from accidentally committing the damned things.</p>
<p>Okay, time to create this bot. Create a file in the project named <code>lib/noted/bot.ex</code>. In this file we do this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/bot.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/bot.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span>Noted.Bot</span> do
  use <span>GenServer</span>
  require <span>Logger</span>

  def start_link(opts) do
    <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span>start_link(__MODULE__, opts, opts)
  end

  <span>@impl</span> <span>GenServer</span>
  def init(opts) do
    {key, _opts} <span>=</span> <span>Keyword</span><span>.</span>pop!(opts, <span>:bot_key</span>)

    case <span>Telegram.Api</span><span>.</span>request(key, <span>"getMe"</span>) do
      {<span>:ok</span>, me} <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>info(<span>"Bot successfully self-identified: </span><span>#{</span>me[<span>"username"</span>]<span>}</span><span>"</span>)

        state <span>=</span> %{
          <span>bot_key</span>: key,
          <span>me</span>: me,
          <span>last_seen</span>: <span>-</span><span>2</span>
        }

        {<span>:ok</span>, state}

      error <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>error(<span>"Bot failed to self-identify: </span><span>#{</span>inspect(error)<span>}</span><span>"</span>)
        <span>:error</span>
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>This is a GenServer and we want to add it to run when our application starts. So below your Noted.Endpoint, inside the list of children in <code>lib/noted/application.ex</code> add this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/application.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/application.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>..</span>
{<span>Noted.Bot</span>, <span>bot_key</span>: <span>System</span><span>.</span>get_env(<span>"TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET"</span>)}
<span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Now you can make sure you’ve run <code>mix deps.get</code> and then run <code>mix phx.server</code> to try it out. Check your logs, the happy message should be there.</p>
<h2 id="set-yourself-up-to-receive-updates">Set yourself up to receive updates</h2>
<p>So it still doesn’t really do anything. We will be using long polling which is a neat way of getting updates from a Telegram bot without publishing the server on the web on some real domain and in some systems it might be a bit of a pain. In Elixir, on a GenServer it is comparatively trivial. At least if you know your GenServers.</p>
<p>Just after we set up our state and before we return <code>{:ok, state}</code> in the bot we need to add a call to <code>next_loop()</code>. So the your <code>init/1</code> looks like this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/bot.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/bot.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>..</span>
  def init(opts) do
    {key, _opts} <span>=</span> <span>Keyword</span><span>.</span>pop!(opts, <span>:bot_key</span>)

    case <span>Telegram.Api</span><span>.</span>request(key, <span>"getMe"</span>) do
      {<span>:ok</span>, me} <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>info(<span>"Bot successfully self-identified: </span><span>#{</span>me[<span>"username"</span>]<span>}</span><span>"</span>)

        state <span>=</span> %{
          <span>bot_key</span>: key,
          <span>me</span>: me,
          <span>last_seen</span>: <span>-</span><span>2</span>
        }
        next_loop()

        {<span>:ok</span>, state}

      error <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>error(<span>"Bot failed to self-identify: </span><span>#{</span>inspect(error)<span>}</span><span>"</span>)
        <span>:error</span>
    end
  end
<span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Now to add the rest. This GenServer will send itself a message saying “ey, check for updates” and then act on that message until the activity is done and then call <code>next_loop/0</code> again to trigger another message. We’ll start with acting on the message with a <code>handle_info/2</code> callback. In your bot GenServer module:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/bot.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/bot.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>..</span>
  <span>@impl</span> <span>GenServer</span>
  def handle_info(<span>:check</span>, %{<span>bot_key</span>: key, <span>last_seen</span>: last_seen} <span>=</span> state) do
    state <span>=</span>
      key
      <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Telegram.Api</span><span>.</span>request(<span>"getUpdates"</span>, <span>offset</span>: last_seen <span>+</span> <span>1</span>, <span>timeout</span>: <span>30</span>)
      <span>|&gt;</span> case do
        <span># Empty, typically a timeout. State returned unchanged.</span>
        {<span>:ok</span>, []} <span>-&gt;</span>
          state

        <span># A response with content, exciting!</span>
        {<span>:ok</span>, updates} <span>-&gt;</span>
          <span># Process our updates and return the latest update ID</span>
          last_seen <span>=</span> handle_updates(updates, last_seen)

          <span># Update the last_seen state so we only get new updates on the</span>
          <span># next check</span>
          %{state <span>|</span> <span>last_seen</span>: last_seen}
      end

    <span># Re-trigger the looping behavior</span>
    next_loop()
    {<span>:noreply</span>, state}
  end

  defp handle_updates(updates, last_seen) do
    updates
    <span># Process our updates</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Enum</span><span>.</span>map(fn update <span>-&gt;</span>
      <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>info(<span>"Update received: </span><span>#{</span>inspect(update)<span>}</span><span>"</span>)
      <span># Offload the updates to whoever they may concern</span>
      broadcast(update)

      <span># Return the update ID so we can boil it down to a new last_seen</span>
      update[<span>"update_id"</span>]
    end)
    <span># Get the highest seen id from the new updates or fall back to last_seen</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Enum</span><span>.</span>max(fn <span>-&gt;</span> last_seen end)
  end

  defp broadcast(update) do
    <span># Send each update to a topic for others to listen to.</span>
    <span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span>broadcast!(<span>Noted.PubSub</span>, <span>"bot_update"</span>, {<span>:update</span>, update})
  end

  defp next_loop do
    <span>Process</span><span>.</span>send_after(self(), <span>:check</span>, <span>0</span>)
  end
<span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Try it out, it should log messages as they are sent to your bot.</p>
<h2 id="getting-real-time-with-liveview">Getting real-time with LiveView</h2>
<p>We can repurpose the existing LiveView that the Phoenix generator gives us. So just open <code>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.ex</code> and its sibling the template <code>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.html.leex</code>. In the <code>page_live.ex</code> file we change it to this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted_web/live/page_live.ex">
  <p>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span>NotedWeb.PageLive</span> do
  use <span>NotedWeb</span>, <span>:live_view</span>

  <span>@impl</span> true
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    <span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span>subscribe(<span>Noted.PubSub</span>, <span>"bot_update"</span>)
    {<span>:ok</span>, assign(socket, <span>messages</span>: [])}
  end

  <span>@impl</span> true
  def handle_info({<span>:update</span>, update}, socket) do
    {<span>:noreply</span>, assign(socket, <span>messages</span>: [to_message(update) <span>|</span> socket<span>.</span>assigns<span>.</span>messages])}
  end

  defp to_message(%{<span>"message"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> message} <span>=</span> _update) do
    firstname <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"from"</span>, <span>"first_name"</span>])
    lastname <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"from"</span>, <span>"last_name"</span>])
    username <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"from"</span>, <span>"username"</span>])

    from <span>=</span>
      case {firstname, lastname, username} do
        {nil, _, username} <span>-&gt;</span> username
        {firstname, nil, _} <span>-&gt;</span> firstname
        {firstname, lastname, _} <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"</span><span>#{</span>firstname<span>}</span><span> </span><span>#{</span>lastname<span>}</span><span>"</span>
      end

    text <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"text"</span>])
    %{<span>from</span>: from, <span>text</span>: text}
  end
end</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>And we change the <code>page_live.html.leex</code> template file to:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted_web/live/page_live.html.leex">
  <p>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.html.leex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>section</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"phx-hero"</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;<span>&lt;</span>%= gettext "Welcome to my Bot!" %&gt;&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;

  <span>&lt;</span>%= for message &lt;<span>-</span> <span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reverse</span><span>(@</span><span>messages</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>%</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;&lt;<span>strong</span>&gt;<span>&lt;</span>%= message.from %&gt;: &lt;/<span>strong</span>&gt;<span>&lt;</span>%= message.text %&gt;&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
  <span>&lt;</span>% end %&gt;
&lt;/<span>section</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Run this and you should see any message to type in the Telegram bot show up. I find it very gratifying just how instantaneous it can be.</p>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>This is just a start and in the <a href="https://github.com/lawik/noted">noted repo</a> you will find some of what I’ve done to push it further, structure the bot a little bit more. Add some responses. You can just try it out by cloning and setting it up.</p>
<p>I implemented some authentication. Currently this means that notes are separated by user. It also means that Noted allows new users by default if they find your bot :D</p>
<p>I implemented the database backing to save notes and tags. I added a bunch more LiveView code. I separated the polling for getUpdates from the handling of the updates a bit more and added a Supervisor to the pairing of GenServers.</p>
<p>Currently on my todo-list is to receive files and media in a nice way and integrate those with the markdown support. If you want practice with Tailwind CSS I’d love for someone to make it look better.</p>
<p>But this particular project aside I find the realtime nature of chat bots very satisfying. Telegram has a well-working API, nice native clients and a hilariously large feature set. And with how fast you can get this up and running when it isn’t your first time I really recommend trying it for things. Heck, you could use it for sending you notices about your app catching fire or occasional status updates from your system. There are so many fun options.</p>
<p>Slightly timely update, especially if you are curious about LiveView or want more of me. Me and a wild gang of Elixir community folks just put our new podcast out there. It is called <a href="https://beamrad.io/">BEAM Radio</a> and you find it at <a href="https://beamrad.io/">beamrad.io</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed the post. Let me know if this is something you would like to see more of as I have quite a few things I could go deeper into from this …</p></article></div>

    <div>
            <p>Telling a business partner you’d be competing with them would never be easy, especially when both businesses still needed to work together.</p><p>So imagine a young Bill Gates telling Steve Jobs that Microsoft was building Windows and competing directly—on an operating system level, at any rate—with the Macintosh.</p><p>“We had to take a walk,” relayed Gates decades later to Jobs’ biographer Walter Isaacson. Jobs started the meeting taking Gates to task for building what he saw as a rip-off of Apple’s work—where Gates countered both companies had worked off Xerox’ innovation. The meeting was going nowhere. And so Jobs had to get out of the office, asked Gates to go for a walk. Maybe it was the clean air, the open sky, the grounding effect of nature. But it worked: “That was when he began saying things like, ‘Okay, okay, but don’t make it too much like what we’re doing,” recalled Gates. Crisis averted, at least momentarily.</p><hr><p>In the intervening years, as Jobs’ vision of a friendly computer and Gates’ of a computer on every desk morphed into today’s always-on computing, we all left the office. We took our word processing and coding, emails and chats, Photoshop and spreadsheets, into coffee shops and lunch queues. We’d think of things that needed done and do them all, anywhere.</p><p>All, that is, except meetings. Simply by virtue of computers and phones including cameras, video calls became the standard for remote meetings. It’s harder if anything to start a group voice call today; video reigns supreme in the workplace.</p><p>Thus my momentary surprise when, sometime in 2017, my editor started our weekly 1-1 meeting in Slack. My phone buzzed with a Slack notification, I tapped it, and seconds later I was on what seemed like a phone call—voice, with no video. Slack, thoughtfully enough, starts voice calls by default. Video’s a button tap away if you need it, but you might not. I brought the phone to my ear and we chatted about work and goals, no video or even headphones needed.</p><p>Maybe we didn’t need video calls for everything. Maybe audio is enough. And maybe it could get us over our collective Zoom fog.</p><h2 id="this-is-what-you-want-this-is-what-you-get-">This is what you want, this is what you get.</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png 600w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png 1424w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>AT&amp;T's original video phone, the MOD I, from 1964.</figcaption></figure><p>“Through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles,” <a href="https://nymag.com/vindicated/2016/11/these-6-visionaries-predicted-the-smartphone.html">predicted</a> the original Tesla in 1926, imagining a future smartphone small enough, “a man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.”</p><p>The future came, sure enough. We got Twitter instead of flying cars, but video calls came almost exactly as they’d been imagined. If phone calls had revolutionized communications, video calls would surely do even more.</p><p>We were so excited about video calls being possible, we collectively rushed into a future that neglected audio calls, with video being the default way to talk in Skype, Messenger, FaceTime, and more. “In some ways we kind of skipped over audio on the internet,” Capiche founder Austin Petersmith remarked to Protocol’s <a href="https://mailchi.mp/protocol/source-code-the-audio-revival-starts-here?e=188ee6bc42">David Pierce</a>. “The amount of experimentation of video is orders of magnitude more than audio, and I think that's because there's a tendency to go toward the highest-fidelity thing available.”</p><p>When every phone comes with a camera, surely we should use it.</p><blockquote>“We shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face.”</blockquote><p>Or perhaps not. Around the same time IBM added the first webcams to laptops in 1996, author David Foster Wallace in <em>Infinite Jest</em> <a href="https://kottke.org/10/06/david-foster-wallace-on-iphone-4s-facetime">imagined a world</a> where we’d try video calls, then decide they were more trouble than they were worth.</p><p>Traditional phone calls, to Wallace, were brilliant for the information they withheld, the fiction they created. “Good old traditional audio-only phone conversations allowed you to presume that the person on the other end was paying com­plete attention to you,” wrote Wallace. We could do anything, look any way you wanted, and the person on the other end of the line would be none the wiser.</p><p>Video calls, he predicted, “rendered the fantasy insupportable.” We’d had to perform for the call, act like we were looking at the speaker, look presentable at the last moment. “There was … no answer-as-you-are informality about visual-video telephone calls.” And perhaps that's what we liked about phone calls all around, without realizing it.</p><p>And so, in <em>Infinite Jest</em>’s imagined world, humanity would switch to video calls for a year, then quickly shift 90% of calls back to audio-only.</p><p>After a year where everything important has been held over video calls, it feels like Wallace may have not been too far off the mark.</p><h2 id="mirror-mirror-on-the-screen">Mirror, mirror on the screen</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png 600w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png 1012w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Searches for "Zoom Fatigue" peaked the end of March 2020, as much of the world went into lockdown and seemingly every interaction was suddenly over video calls.</figcaption></figure><p>It turns out, it’s tiring, being on camera all day.</p><p>You have to look at the camera, fake eye-contact with the speaker. But “in real life, how often do you stand within three feet of a colleague and stare at their face? Probably never,” surmised Liz Fosslien and Mollie West Duffy in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue">Harvard Business Review</a>. “Having to engage in a ‘constant gaze’ makes us uncomfortable — and tired.”</p><p>You have to perform, keep up appearances, seem engaged and attentive. “When you're on a video conference, you know everybody's looking at you; you are on stage, so there comes the social pressure and feeling like you need to perform. Being performative is nerve-wracking and more stressful.” As the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting">BBC quoted INSEAD professor Gianpiero Petriglieri</a>: “You cannot relax into the conversation naturally.”</p><blockquote>"When you're on a video conference, you know everybody's looking at you; you are on stage."</blockquote><p>And for all your effort, tech too often gets in the way. Your mic may not work, your video call app might crash, a siren might go by right as you need to talk. Even a slow internet connection can make you come across worse to your colleagues, as a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581914000287">2014 study by Berlin Institute of Technology researchers</a> found that when the audio is delayed more than 1.2 seconds, participants “are perceived less attentive, extraverted and conscientious.”</p><p>You’re performing. You’re trying to decipher unclear facial cues. Add context collapse—where every event happens in the same space, without the familiar separation between work and leisure spaces—and your brain never has time to turn off. All that together gives us “Zoom fog,” the mental blurriness after one too many video calls, and the dread of needing to do more.</p><h2 id="call-me-video-maybe-">Call me. Video, maybe.</h2><p>And so, just as remote meetings are more common than ever, <em>Infinite Jest</em>'s prediction that we might “actually prefer the retrograde old low-tech Bell-era voice-only phone interface after all” is new trend in the remote startup world, at least.</p><p>“Video makes many conversations worse,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1358801649381244928?s=21">Tweeted</a> Basecamp CEO Jason Freed recently, after decades of experience leading one of the first remote companies.</p><p>He’s not alone. The Gumroad team is switching meetings to audio talks after founder <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1358799625692479493">Sahil Lavingia</a> says they found “Video is largely unnecessary.” “We almost never use our cameras for internal meetings,” shared @MikeRaia in a <a href="https://capiche.com/q/what-are-your-video-call-defaults">Capiche discussion about video call defaults</a>, where @briana9 mentioned “My team is mostly video off.”</p><blockquote>We might actually prefer the retrograde old low-tech Bell-era voice-only phone interface after all.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hnshah/status/1161361656724635648">Hiten Shah</a>—founder of CrazyEgg, KISSmetrics, and FYI—shared that “having remote meetings while walking” and “sitting in nature during a meeting” were some of the things he does to make remote work more healthy, tips one suspects Jobs might have enjoyed. You could walk during video meetings, at the risk of making your team seasick—switch to audio calls, though, and you can move as much as you please.</p><p>You could even take it to the logical extreme and drop meetings altogether. Todoist founder <a href="https://twitter.com/amix3k/status/1361929937247236097">Amir Salihefendić</a> mentioned that his favorite company perk is “Async-first. This enables you to live wherever and work when it suits you.” You could share your thoughts in Slack or record them in tools like <a href="https://www.yac.com/">Yac</a>, and rethink if meetings are even necessary. Or, go in the other direction, and use something like Discord with always-on audio chat in the background to talk whenever you want, spontaneously.</p><p>Whether spontaneously, location-independent meetings are what your team needs, or working more async, audio’s part of making it happen. You can turn off the camera, relax a bit more on calls, and think more about what’s being said and less about how you look while you’re saying it. You could take a walk, or take the call from wherever you happen to be at the moment, when video's no longer a requirement.</p><p>It's part of the enduring appeal of radio shows and podcasts—you can listen and learn while doing other things, without being glued to a screen for yet another hour. Where video ties us down, audio lets us do more, frees us to work the way that fits best without performing for the camera. We can talk on Facetime Audio and Slack calls, host live audio shows on Capiche FM and more, all with just a microphone.</p><p>Sometimes more isn’t better. <a href="https://capiche.com/e/yo-atomized-communication">Sometimes less data can be more</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://capiche.fm/"><img src="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/capichefm-5530d0860607af328a41b93b4c30d7247a7d55a14034c67f418a607f78da30f5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/capichefm-5530d0860607af328a41b93b4c30d7247a7d55a14034c67f418a607f78da30f5.png 600w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/capichefm-5530d0860607af328a41b93b4c30d7247a7d55a14034c67f418a607f78da30f5.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><h5 id="image-credits-microphone-photo-by-jukka-aalho-via-unsplash-mod-i-video-phone-photo-via-bonhams-">Image Credits: Microphone photo by Jukka Aalho via <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/_t9c-kmMjl8">Unsplash</a>.

    </span></p><p>Before COVID, setting up a home office or desk setup was an interest of remote
workers and tech enthusiasts. Now, with most knowledge workers going remote
because of the pandemic, the desk setup has become essential.</p><p>For me, my desk is both a place for work and play. I spend most of my waking
hours working on <a href="https://www.get-carrot.com/">Carrot</a>, writing this blog,
processing photos, and more. It’s part of a larger studio space that invites me
in every morning and inspires me to do my best work.</p><h2 id="creative-space-as-a-component-of-the-creative-process">Creative space as a component of the creative process</h2><p>In <a href="https://www.arun.is/blog/palma-de-mallorca/">my visit to Mallorca a few years back</a>, I had the
fortune of visiting the studio of artist

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Llu%C3%ADs_Sert">Josep Lluís Sert</a>, an
accomplished architect in his own right, envisioned it for his friend. I could

can’t help feeling like something is missing. I don’t just want to know a list

What’s the story behind that particular desk? How about that color scheme?</p><p>We have the opportunity not just to create something worthy of sharing on social
media. Why not do more? The ideal desk setup has the potential to immediately
transport us to a frame of mind that leads to the best work. It’s just like how
being dressed to the nines can give us a jolt of confidence when meeting
strangers.</p><p>As Marie Kondō writes
in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308"><em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em></a>,
“The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not
for the person we were in the
past.”<sup id="1"><a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></sup> Said another way, the
environment we work in should reflect the creative work we aspire to create.</p><h2 id="two-principles-to-find-great-design">Two principles to find great design</h2><p>So how exactly do we create a space like that? To build the right creative
environment for myself, I look to a set of principles. The first two of these,
applies broadly to finding well-designed object, regardless of the use.</p><h3 id="principle-1-objects-must-form-an-emotional-bond-with-the-user">Principle 1: Objects must form an emotional bond with the user</h3><p>I have to admit that I love material objects. I’ve written at length about
Dieter Rams, Apple products, cameras, and industrial design. The things I’ve
carefully chosen to live my life with remind me of my job as a designer —
bringing order to the chaos. However, this love of physical items isn’t innate.</p><p>After saving up money from my first high school job, I decided to buy an MP3
player. It’s then that I discovered the world of gadget blogs and review sites.
I pored over them. The sites I was reading all pointed me to the Creative Nomad
Jukebox Zen. Reviews touted its class-leading 30GB storage as its primary
selling point.</p><p>I, however, wasn’t convinced. Besides the fact that some independent reviews
mentioned that the headphone jack was prone to breaking, I thought it looked
ugly.</p><p>There I was, about to spend 20% of my net worth on the first independent
purchase of my life. I wasn’t going to squander it on some plasticky
monstrosity. On a chance visit to the mall, I walked into the Apple store and
played with an iPod. That moment changed my life.</p><p><span>

    </span> <span>One is now forgotten, the other a
classic</span></p><p>I came away not only intending to buy an iPod, but with a new dimension of my
taste. I already had a side of me that read the reviews, did the research, and
tried to find the “best” of something, but this new side didn’t compare numbers
or stats. Instead, it cared about how something felt in hand, the sound it made
when I pressed a button, the typeface used on the interface, the box it came in.</p><p>I realized that objects must not only fulfill their functional purpose, but they
must also form an emotional bond with the user.</p><h3 id="principle-2-prefer-the-preowned-classic-to-the-brand-new-unproven-product">Principle 2: Prefer the preowned classic to the brand new, unproven product.</h3><p>The democratization of information means that nearly everyone wants to have the
best of everything. “A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that eighty per
cent of consumers look at online reviews before making major purchases, and a
host of studies have logged the strong influence those reviews have on the
decisions people make.”<sup id="2"><a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>We want the best, from the restaurant for dinner tonight, to our next car, to
something as mundane as a vacuum cleaner. It’s not new. For decades,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Reports">Consumer Reports</a> has tested
and recommended the best of nearly anything someone could buy.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><blockquote id="3">"Perhaps the most miraculous part of Consumer Reports is that its work is technically a public service: Its parent organization, which publishes the magazine (and is also called Consumer Reports), is a nonprofit. The operation launched in 1936, when consumer-protection laws were practically nonexistent, and for much of its history the magazine has shaped both consumer sentiment and government policy."<sup><a href="#footnote_3">[3]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Today, Consumer Reports is slowly fading away as newer replacements shine in an
internet-first world.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirecutter_(website)">Wirecutter</a> is one of
those spiritual successors. I used to be a huge fan. I was a tech reporter in a
previous life and looked up to Wirecutter’s founder,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lam">Brian Lam</a> when he was editor-in-chief
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmodo">Gizmodo</a>. I loved that Wirecutter
takes the best of what made Consumer Reports great and mixed it with what makes
Gizmodo great.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Now, however, I’m not so sure I like it. As Owen Williams writes:</p><blockquote id="4">"Review sites like Wirecutter are incentivized to pick products, even if they aren't perfect, because they don't make money unless you buy something. Instead of running advertising on their pages, Wirecutter relies on affiliate links, offered by sites like Amazon. When you click "buy" on something the site recommends and follow through with the purchase, Wirecutter gets a cut of the sale price, which is higher the more expensive the product is."<sup><a href="#footnote_4">[4]</a></sup></blockquote><p>That’s a fundamental difference with Consumer Reports and its
customer-protection mentality. I’ve never seen Wirecutter simply recommend that
someone look on Craigslist or eBay for something even when that’s probably the
best option.</p><p>Phones, computers, or cars are constantly changing and there are clear
advantages with newer ones. Furniture, clothing, or household appliances, on the
other hand, have changed very little in half a century. It’s silly to constrain
ourselves to the world of what’s available new on a shelf, ready to ship to your
home in two days.</p><p>You tell me. If you are looking for an orange juicer, are you going to buy
Wirecutter’s recommendation? Or, would you rather own
<a href="https://www.arun.is/blog/braun-mpz2/">a piece from the 70s designed by legendary designers at Braun</a>
for the same price?</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Sure, you would have to buy it used, but it’s also proven. It has survived half
a century and likely will survive yet another. And, obviously, it’s not ugly.</p><p>As Dieter Rams says in the fifth of his
<a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design">ten principles for good design</a>,
“Good design is unobtrusive. Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They
are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore
be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.”</p><p>By constraining themselves to what’s still made today, sites like Wirecutter
completely miss the attractive, affordable options out there on the used market,
some of which are part of museum collections. The result is more ugliness. If
I’m going to see something every day, it better fit in with its surroundings.</p><p>Therefore when possible, I prefer the preowned classic to the brand new,
unproven product.</p><h2 id="how-i-hunt-for-good-design">How I hunt for good design</h2><p>If we are to ignore the review sites, where do we go? I’m not going to pretend
that I’m an expert, but I’ve learned a few things over the years.</p><p>The first is that museum collections are your friend. I regularly search
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/">MoMA</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://collection.maas.museum/search?q=radio&amp;p=4">MAAS</a>,
and&nbsp;<a href="https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/">Cooper Hewitt</a>&nbsp;collections when I
need an appliance or furniture. Often, I find something from one of these museum
collections for cheap on the used market. They are so obscure that there isn’t
much demand.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="moma" title="moma" src="https://www.arun.is/static/cf6248df7fa0b6e66ce401bf90126a27/20801/moma.jpg" srcset="https://www.arun.is/static/cf6248df7fa0b6e66ce401bf90126a27/98e5d/moma.jpg 180w,https://www.arun.is/static/cf6248df7fa0b6e66ce401bf90126a27/543cd/moma.jpg 360w,https://www.arun.is/static/cf6248df7fa0b6e66ce401bf90126a27/20801/moma.jpg 720w,https://www.arun.is/static/cf6248df7fa0b6e66ce401bf90126a27/b37e7/moma.jpg 1080w,https://www.arun.is/static/cf6248df7fa0b6e66ce401bf90126a27/33266/moma.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Some of these classic objects of design may seem expensive to buy. However,
their prices when used are usually quite stable. Buy one with cash. If you ever
decide that you no longer want it, you can sell it back for the same price.
That’s a big contrast to buying something new from Amazon, where there will be
some depreciation.</p><p>When buying office furniture and accessories, look where the big buyers go. Most
office furniture is sold by furniture companies like
<a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/">Herman Miller</a>,
<a href="https://www.steelcase.com/">Steelcase</a>, and <a href="https://www.haworth.com/">Haworth</a>
directly to businesses, hospitals, etc. The selection you’ll find is vastly
different from consumer-oriented retailers. You’ll find beautiful options that
you’ll never see on Amazon. As an added benefit, these business customers often
upgrade or go out-of-business, so items like chairs, lamps, and monitor arms hit
the used market for great prices in large quantities.</p><p>When buying used, patience is vital. I have found that it can take more than a
year of waiting to find the ideal piece. I’ve spent four years continuously
building my current desk setup.</p><h2 id="my-desk-setup">My desk setup</h2><p>That brings me to my creative space. I’m fortunate enough to have a light and
airy loft that I can call my studio. Perhaps in a future post, I’ll do a proper
tour of the whole space. For now, let’s focus on my desk setup.</p><p>In addition to the two principles that I listed previously, I’ve added three
more that are specific to my desk setup.</p><ol><li>Objects must not just fulfill …</li></ol></div></section></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Thomas Megel is aiming to bring down the cost and complexity of accurate 3D scanning — and to prove it, he's scanned a Raspberry Pi single-board computer using another Raspberry Pi single-board computer.</p><p>Megel founded OpenScan.eu with a mission to create a low-cost 3D scanner built around an Arduino-powered control unit and off-the-shelf smartphones and cameras. In its latest incarnation, though, the project has shifted focus with a new variant running atop a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and a Raspberry Pi Camera Module or HQ Camera Module.</p><p>"I am able to reach great accuracy with just a Raspberry Pi [and] Pi Camera [Module] v2.1," Megel explains, following the production of a demonstration video and 3D scan of a second Raspberry Pi. "I am currently testing an upcoming cloud processing feature, but it will always be possible to do the processing locally on a PC with Meshroom or similar software." </p><figure><figcaption>The OpenScan system offers 10-micron accuracy when using a Raspberry Pi HQ Camera Module. (📹: Thomas Megel)</figcaption></figure><p>"The [processing technique] is called photogrammetry and basically, the software is looking for common points in two images, matching those, do some math-magic and calculates camera intrinsics, camera positions and finally the coordinates for each point in space. I have implemented auto-scaling in the upcoming cloud processing, without the use of any markers."</p><p>The sample scan provided by Megel to demonstrate the scanner's capabilities took, he claims, less than an hour of wall time and just four clicks of user interaction — though the processing requires the in-beta cloud platform or a more powerful host PC, with the Raspberry Pi unable to provide enough compute itself. In testing, the system has proven capable of sub-50-micron accuracy with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2.1 and around 10 microns with the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera Module.</p><p><span>More information is available </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/lpndip/3d_scanned_a_raspberry_pi_with_my_diy_raspberry/" rel="nofollow">on Megel's Reddit thread</a><span> and </span><a href="https://github.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan" rel="nofollow">on the project's GitHub repository</a><span>.

<h3 id="submodular-function-models-diminishing-returns">Submodular function models diminishing returns</h3>
<p>A submodular function is a set function whose value, has the property that the difference in the incremental value of the function that a single element makes when added to an input set decreases as the size of the input set increases.</p>
<p>
\( S_1 \subset S_2 \),
\(i \notin S_2 \),
\( F(\lbrace i \rbrace \cup S_1) - F(S_1) \geq F(\lbrace i \rbrace \cup S_2) - F(S_2) \)
</p>

<p>We encounter this property during shopping in form of quantity discount.
The discount of addition of on more item to the purchase cart, decreases with the size of the cart.
This priciple is called diminishing returns.</p>
<p>For example the price per product price as a function of set of purchased products \( S \) could be dependent on the product count \( | S | \).
From following, we then observe diminishing discount of adding an extra product into the cart.</p>
<p>
\( \mathrm{price}(S) = \exp(-|S|) \)<br>
\( S_1 \subset S_2 \implies | S_1 | \leq | S_2 | \)<br>
\( \mathrm{price}(S_1 + \lbrace x \rbrace) - \mathrm{price}(S_1) \geq \)
\( \mathrm{price}(S_2 + \lbrace x \rbrace) - \mathrm{price}(S_2) \),<br>
because
\( \exp(- | S_1 | )(e^{-1} - 1) \geq \exp(- | S_2 | )(e^{-1} - 1) \)
</p>

<p>Submodular functions appear also in maximization problems where they model notions of diversity, information and coverage.
For example one would like a document summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document,
but avoid topic repetition at the same time as repeating a fact has a diminishing return.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/scans/submodular.pdf">Submodular functions can be seen as discrete convexity</a> e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>polynomial time algo for finding minimum-set.</li>

<li>Submodular functions can be combined, and the resulting function is still submodular.</li>

trades off redundancy of query results for small decrease relevance of results for already ranked documents or phrases.
It make the trade off using the following greedy algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>\( V \) = a set of documents</li>
<li>\( S \) = a subset of documents in V already selected</li>
<li>\( \lambda \) = a constant in range of \( ( 0, 1 ) \)</li>
</ul>
<p>

\( \mathrm{argmax}_{i \in V \setminus S } ( \lambda \mathrm{sim}_1 (i, Q) - (1 - \lambda) \mathrm{max}_{j \in S} \mathrm{sim}_2 (i, j)) \),
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part of equation growths with document similarity with the query.</li>
<li>The second part decreases with the document similarity with already selected documents.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summarization-as-budgeted-submodularity-maximization">Summarization as budgeted submodularity maximization</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N10-1134.pdf">Multi-document Summarization via Budgeted Maximization of Submodular Functions</a>
formulates summarization as the problem of maximizing a submodular function under a budget constraint,
where \( V \) is set of all sentences, \( S \) are selected sentences, \( c_i \) is word count, \( f \) is submodular function, \( B \) is the word budget, then:</p>
<p>\( S_{max} = \max_{S \subset V} f(S) : \sum_{i \in S} c_i \leq B \)</p>
<p>The paper proposes MMR alternative that is submodular if the similarity is non-negative:</p>
<p>\( f = \sum_{i \in V \setminus S} \sum_{j \in S} \mathrm{sim}(i,j) - \lambda \sum_{i,j \in S: i \neq j} \mathrm{sim}(i,j) \)</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part grows as selected sentences \( S \) become more similar to all sentences \( V \).</li>
<li>The second part decreases as selected sentences become more similar between each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>For which they present greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantee. The algo repeatedely finds documents maximizing:</p>
<p>\( \mathrm{nextDoc}(S) = \mathrm{argmax_i} \frac{f(S \cup \lbrace i \rbrace) - f(S)}{c_i^r} \)</p>
<p>until the budget is reached. The algo Details are presented in <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N10-1134.pdf">the paper</a>.</p>
<p>How is this related exactly to the MMR? If the costs for each item is the same e.g. \( c_i = 1 \), then we get:</p>
<p>
\( f(S \cup \lbrace k \rbrace ) - f(S) = \)
\( \sum_{i \in V \setminus \lbrace k \rbrace} \mathrm{sim} (i, k) - 2 (1 + \lambda) \sum_{i \in S} \mathrm{sim}(i, k) \).
</p>

<div>
<p><b>Proof:</b></p><p>
\( f_1 := \sum_{i \in V \setminus S, j \in S } \mathrm{sim} (i, j) \),<br>
\( f_1(S \cup \lbrace k \rbrace ) - f_1(S) = - \sum_{j \in S} \mathrm{sim}(k, j) + \sum_{i \in V \setminus (S \cup \lbrace k \rbrace )} \mathrm{sim}(i, k) = \)
\( \sum_{j \in V \setminus \lbrace k \rbrace} \mathrm{sim}(k, j) - 2 \sum_{j \in S} \mathrm{sim}(k, j) \)
<br>
\( f_2 := \sum_{i,j \in S : i \neq j } \mathrm{sim} (i, j) \),<br>
\( f_2(S \cup \lbrace k \rbrace ) - f_2(S) = 2 \sum_{j \in S} sim(k, j) \),<br>
\( f = f_1 - \lambda f_2 \)
</p>
</div>

<p>The equation is very much like the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance equation, except \( \lambda \) the diversity term has always non-zero weight.
The cost \( c_k \), can then be added back to rescale according to the sentence length.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part grows with the sentence \(k \) similarity to all sentences in \( V \) i.e. with sentence centrality in the whole document.</li>
<li>The second part decreases with sentence similarity to the already selected sentences.</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup with idf-modified-cosine similarity matrix achieved SoTA outperforming PageRank based centrality summarization algorithms like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.2128.pdf">LexRank</a>.
LexRank applies PageRank to the idf-modified-cosine similarity matrix to get the centrality scores for the sentences.
The LexRank paper mentions use MMR as a re-ranker, making the comparison with the submodularity solution fair.</p>

<p>End-to-end trained neural encoder-decoder summarizers suffer from repetition and insufficient information coverage.
Previous papers added coverage requirements into the loss.
This paper instead modifies the attention weights using the principle of diminishing returns using a submodular function.</p>

encoder sequence position \( i \),
attention matrix \( a_{i, t} \),
concave non-decreasing function \( F \) with \( F(0) = 0 \) e.g. ,
then diminishing attention is defined as:</p>
<p>\( DimAtt_{i,t} = F(\sum_{\tau = 0}^{t} a_{i, \tau}) - F(\sum_{\tau = 0}^{t - 1} a_{i, \tau}) \)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Lately, I get people asking me when microservices are a good idea. In <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227">systems design explains the world</a>, I talked about big-picture issues like second system effect, innovator’s dilemmas, and more. Can systems design answer the microservices question?</p>
<p>Yes, but you might not like the answers. First, we'll need some history.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-microservice">What is a microservice?</h4>
<p>You can find various definitions on the Internet. Here's mine: microservices are the most extreme possible backlash against <em>monoliths</em>.</p>
<p>Monoliths are what happen when you link everything your entire app needs into one giant program and deploy it as one big blob. Monoliths have a long history, going back to frameworks like CGI, Django, Rails, and PHP.</p>
<p>Right away, let's abandon the assumption that a monolith and a fleet of microservices are the only two options. There's a wide and nuanced continuum from "one giant service that does everything" to "infinite tiny services that each do nearly nothing."</p>
<p>If you follow fads, you'll have built a monolith at least once (whether on purpose or because that's what traditional frameworks encouraged you to do), then discovered some problems with monoliths, then heard that microservices are the answer, then started rearchitecting everything as microservices.</p>
<p>But don't follow fads. There are many points in between those extremes. One of them is probably right for you. A better approach starts with where you want to put your <em>interfaces</em>.</p>
<h4 id="boxes-and-arrows">Boxes and arrows</h4>
<p>An interface is the connection between <em>modules.</em> A module is a collection of related code. In systems design, we talk about "boxes and arrows" engineering: modules are the boxes, and interfaces are the arrows.</p>
<p>The deeper question then is: how big are the boxes? How much goes in each box? How do we decide when to split one big box into two smaller ones? What's the best way to connect the boxes? There are many approaches to all this. Nobody quite knows what's best. It's one of the hardest problems in software architecture.</p>
<p>Over the decades, we've evolved through many kinds of "boxes." <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">Goto statements were "considered harmful"</a> largely because they prevented any hierarchy at all. Then we added functions or procedures; those are very simple boxes, with interfaces (parameters and return codes) between them.</p>
<p>Depending which branch of programming you go down, you then discover recursive functions, combinators, static function prototypes, libraries (statically or runtime-linked), objects (OOP), coroutines, protected virtual memory, processes, threads, JITs, namespaces, sandboxes, chroots, jails, containers, virtual machines, supervisors, hypervisors, microkernels, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernels</a>.</p>
<p>And that's just the boxes! Once you have boxes isolated from each other, then you need to connect them with arrows. For that, we have ABIs, APIs, syscalls, sockets, RPCs, filesystems, databases, message passing systems, and "virtualized hardware."</p>
<p>If you tried to draw a complete boxes-and-arrows diagram of a modern Unix system (which I won't), it would be wild: functions inside threads inside processes inside containers inside userspace, layered under a kernel, inside a VM, running on hardware in a rack in a datacenter in a cloud provider tied together by an orchestration system, and so on.</p>
<p>Each of those boxes at each of the abstraction layers is somehow isolated from and then connected to some of the others, at the same or other layers. Some are inside others. You couldn't draw an honest version of this picture in a mere two dimensions without lines criss-crossing hopelessly.</p>
<p>This all evolved over decades. Fancy people call it "path dependence." I call it a mess. And let's be clear: most of the mess no longer provides much value.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on what became very ugly evolutionary results, let's talk about what people were <em>trying</em> to do while they invented all that stuff.</p>
<h4 id="the-quest-for-modularity">The quest for modularity</h4>
<p>The top-line goals of module systems are always the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate each bit of code from the other bits.</li>
<li>Re-connect those bits only where explicitly intended (through a well-defined interface).</li>
<li>Guarantee that bits you change will still be compatible with the right other bits.</li>
<li>Upgrade, downgrade, and scale some bits without having to upgrade all the other bits simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>The computer industry spends an absolutely immense amount of time messing around, trying to find the perfect balance of all these modularity issues, while still trying to keep development as painless and easy as possible.</p>
<p>We are, in short, not succeeding.</p>
<p>By far the part we're worst at is #1, isolation. If we could truly and efficiently isolate one bit of code from another, the other goals would mostly fall into place. But we simply do not know how.</p>
<p>Isolation is a super hard problem. Goodness knows people have tried. Yet browser sandbox escapes still happen regularly, undetected privilege escalation attacks are simply assumed to exist on every OS, iOS still gets jailbroken periodically, DRM never works (for better or worse), virtual machines and containers regularly have vulnerabilities discovered, and systems like <a href="https://blog.alcide.io/insecure-by-default-kubernetes-networking">k8s have their containers configured insecurely by default</a>.</p>
<p>People have even been known to <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/04/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles/">figure out encryption keys on remote servers by sending well-timed packets</a> to them over the Internet. Meanwhile, the most spectacular isolation failures in recent memory were the <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre attacks</a>, which allowed any program on a computer, even a javascript app in a web browser, to read the memory of other programs on the same computer, even across sandboxes or virtual machines.</p>
<p>Every new isolation technology goes through a cycle like the following, from optimism to despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>New idea: we'll finally get it right this time, once and for all!</li>
<li>Initial experiments seem to work.</li>
<li>(Users complain that it's even slower and more tedious than the last thing we tried.)</li>
<li>Early fatal flaws are discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Widespread deployment.</li>
<li>Ever-more-subtle flaws are successively discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Eventually, we find flaws that we simply don't know how to patch.</li>
<li>Lose hope that efficient isolation is even possible with this method.</li>
<li>But also we can never retire this isolation method because now too many people are depending on it.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, at this point security people simply don't believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process isolation and memory protection on a Unix system.</li>
<li>Privilege separation between OS processes when remote code execution ("RCE" for security people) is allowed.</li>
<li>Filtering syscalls to isolate a process.</li>
<li>Mutually untrusted processes sharing a CPU hyperthread.</li>
<li>Memory isolation between virtual machines on a CPU core.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know, the state of the art, the very best isolation, is something like the Chrome sandbox or <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a>. The big browser vendors and cloud providers all use tools like these. The tools remain imperfect, but providers do chase down every new breach as fast as they can, and the rate of new flaws is fairly slow.</p>
<p>Isolation is better than it's ever been before… if you put all your isolation at the virtual machine (VM) level so that your cloud provider can do it for you because nobody else knows how, or updates often enough.</p>
<p>If you trust your cloud provider's VM isolation, you can have hope that all known problems are mitigated; but we have every reason to think more problems will be found.</p>
<p>That's… actually pretty good, all things considered. At least we have <em>something</em> that works.</p>
<h4 id="great-vms-for-everything">Great! VMs for everything!</h4>
<p>Well, hold on. Spinning up an isolated VM for every little module is a pain. And how big is a module?</p>
<p>Long ago, when Java first came out, the dream was that every line of every function in every object could have permissions enforced, even between objects in the same application binary, so that CPU-enforced memory protection wouldn't be needed. Nobody believes anymore that they can make that work. And marketing claims like "cloud functions" aside, nobody really thinks you should try.</p>
<p>None of the currently-known isolation methods work <em>perfectly</em>, but each of them works to <em>some approximation</em>. Increasingly skilled attackers, or increasingly valuable targets, require better and more annoying isolation. The best isolation we know right now is inter-VM sandboxing provided by tier-1 cloud providers. The worst, well, it goes down to zero.</p>
<p>Let's also assume, skipping over the evidence, that most systems are so tightly coupled that <strong>a reasonably skilled attacker can break through laterally between modules.</strong> So, for example, if someone can link a malicious library into your Go or C++ program, they can probably take control of that entire program.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your program has write access to a database, attackers can probably make it write <em>anywhere</em> in the database. If it can contact the network, they can probably contact <em>anywhere</em> in the network. If it can execute arbitrary Unix commands or system calls, they can probably get Unix root access. If it's in a container, they can probably break out of the container and into other containers. If malicious data can <a href="https://imagetragick.com/">crash the png decoder</a>, they can probably make it do anything else the decoder program is allowed to do. And so on.</p>
<p>An especially powerful form of attack is getting the ability to commit code, because that code will eventually be run on developer machines, and some developer or production machine somewhere probably has access to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>The above is maybe a little too pessimistic, but making those assumptions can help avoid overcomplicating your systems without improving actual security. In <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf">Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0</a>, Daniel J. Bernstein points out (if I may heavily paraphrase) that many of the defenses he added in qmail, particularly isolating the different components from each other using chroot and different Unix uids, were not worthwhile and have never paid off.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's take it for granted that attackers with the ability to execute code can "usually" jump …</p></div></div>

<p>The term “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a>” is a useful one. Unfortunately, as with anything useful, it is overused and used sloppily. It’s also sometimes misused to disparage a historical decision somebody disagrees with. But more than that, I think it is broadly misinterpreted. The term is intended to help justify work that has no immediate customer benefit, but rather is expected to help us execute faster. The business analysis on the value of a new feature customers are clamoring for is easier to quantify than the value of a system re-architecture. It can be hard to justify investment in cleaning up the code.</p>
<h2>But that’s not really what “debt” means.</h2>
<p>Most of us think about <em>debt</em> from the perspective of personal finance – that is, largely as a convenient way to buy things and pay for them later. Or perhaps from a debtor’s prison perspective: something to be avoided, or certainly paid off as quickly as possible. But when engineers raise the topic of <em>technical debt,</em> they’re often communicating with business owners, who often have degrees in business or economics. To such a business person, this is simply not what “debt” means. When an engineer talks about technical debt to scare managers into worrying about operations (“We have a ton of technical debt, we need to fix it!”), it kinda sounds to sophisticated business people like… well, like what those same business people sound like when they try to justify new technologies to technologists: “I want you to blockchain the virtual. Right away. Because it seems like we don’t have enough AI, yet.”</p>
<p>A business leader may be thinking about things very differently. Many may think about debt in terms of <em>leverage. </em>Well-structured debt is a benefit; it provides extra money we can use today. So if you talk to an options trader about having a ton of technical debt, their reaction is likely to be, “That’s fantastic! how do we get more?”</p>
<h2>It’s not about debt.</h2>
<p>The term invites us to focus on the wrong part of the problem. The casual interpretation of <em>debt</em> suggests that problems accrue because we are borrowing time from the future and being lazy about paying off our debts, and that is inaccurate and unfair. In fact what we’re doing is making intentional, mindful decisions about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not debt; it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_value">future value</a>. Those are related but different things.</p>
<p>I’ve often said that “<em>every keystroke a developer makes is a business decision.</em>” We are, every day, in almost everything we do, continuously trading off opportunity cost: should I do a thing now, or wait and do it later so we can do something else now? When I decide it’s not worth adding a comment to piece of code, I’m fundamentally trading off the value of investing the time right now to clarify my intent against the time a future developer (usually me) needs to spend figuring out what the hell that code is doing. When I decide not to introduce a new abstraction to make the code more flexible, I’m trading off the value of investing time right now so it will be easier to do something else later. These are all opportunity cost decisions.</p>
<h2>Sometimes… you just do it</h2>
<p>There is a subtle consideration that is often overlooked in these conversations. In many cases, just <em>evaluating</em> the opportunity cost of doing something costs as much or more than doing it. When an activity is small enough, trying to decide whether the investment is worth it can be more work than the work itself. When in doubt, we should just do it. The first question to ask is whether it is even worth worrying about the cost of an investment. Small changes, incremental changes, housekeeping, etc,&nbsp; are all things that often take less time to do than to measure. The&nbsp; concept of “refactoring” is&nbsp; partially founded on this principle! So for small or medium code refactoring:</p>
<div>
<ol data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0">I always clean as I go. It’s like housework. You never really&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">need</i>&nbsp;to vacuum, because if you leave it until you&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">actually</i>&nbsp;need to vacuum, your carpet is [elided].</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0">If I have trouble understanding some code I need to work on, I’ll often refactor to help clarify. This requires good unit tests, but of course if you don’t have good unit tests what you’re doing isn’t refactoring. So I’ll add unit tests first, which also helps explain the code (“wait, it does what now?” is sometimes a very useful test result). Then if needed I’ll refactor to improve comprehensibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuous housekeeping tasks – especially operational hygiene, such as good logging for diagnostics, operational metrics (you should never ever fail because you run out of disk space!), continuous deployment, keeping operating system and libraries up to date, etc – we should not waste time debating whether these are worth doing. If you have reached the point you have to worry about the investment it takes to upgrade your servers, <strong>the failure happened a long time ago.</strong> That’s not technical debt, it’s poor operational hygiene.</p>

<h2>AI: Diagnosis and Forecasting Spread of Infectious Diseases</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/diagnosis-and-forecasting.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming the desired method used in the healthcare sector to interpret different characteristics of pathogens.</p>
            <p>The outbreak of such pathogens can cause a disease outbreak like COVID-19. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/latest-ai-led-developments-in-covid-19-prevention-and-management">Advancements in technology</a> like AI and machine learning can help scientists and researchers contain the further spread of these diseases.</p>
            <p>Machine learning models can not only preempt such diseases but also control the spread of the virus worldwide. Using such models can help scientists identify faster clinical trials and quickly identify a relevant drug to help tackle the disease. AI is at the brink of revolutionizing the healthcare system.</p>
            <p>As a result, AI plays a significant role in analyzing swaths of data from multiple sources of infectious diseases such as outbreak investigation reports, social media platforms, national surveillance systems, vaccine reports, and sentinel reporting systems.</p>
            <p>
                The below infographic talks about how the healthcare sector used AI for knowledge discovery.

<p>It appears that your Messenger inbox will be a universal inbox where you can reply to both instagram messages and messenger messengers.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Facebook is doing this either, earlier last year Facebook unified the inboxes for businesses, where all your instagram DMs and messages to your Facebook page will be delivered to one unified inbox where you can reply to clients though one unified inbox.</p>
<p>I really liked this feature on Facebook business, because I didn’t have to install instagram app to message my clients.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what these changes mean, here’s a summery.</p>

<p>But combining Facebook and instagram messages on personal profiles is not the same as combining inboxes for business pages. Here’s why,</p>
<p>We use Facebook more as a private social network. We share content with our friends and relatives, and we only message to friends and relatives on Facebook. However, Instagram is more public oriented social network. That means it’s designed to be public by nature, and content we post on instagram are more for public and we might or might not use it for conversations.</p>
<p>Basically I don’t want random strangers that follow me on Instagram able to send direct messages to my Facebook.</p>
<p>On the other hand, is it a greater plan for Facebook to combine all chat platforms to one? What if in future we will be able to read and reply to WhatsApp conversations though messenger? One unified inbox to chat with everyone in your social sphere.</p>
<p>What do you think? Let me down in the comments.</p>

I moved a project from <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> + <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> to…&nbsp;Rails, baby! Back to the future. My earlier post on <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html"><em>Second-guessing the modern web</em></a> was inspired by this experience, that for the product we were building, a ‘modern’ stack was not working as well as a traditional one.</p><p>We didn’t do competitive analysis against Laravel, Django, or Phoenix. They’re similar, not radically better or worse. There are multiple acceptable solutions to a problem, and this was more a matter of choosing the right <em>kind</em> of solution than pursuing some kind of perfect choice and burning hours and motivation doing the window-shopping.</p><p>What helped Rails win was that the team had a little more experience in Ruby (with the exception of myself), and we found plenty of resources for developing and deploying the stack. Rails fit perfectly into the ideology of <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/"><em>Choosing boring technology</em></a>. Another part of the product would be the hard, innovative part, so it made no sense to grapple with bleeding-edge web frameworks.</p><p>This was a really fun experience. There’s a lot to love about Rails. Other communities could learn a bit from the Ruby &amp; Rails culture and wisdom. I won’t implement <em>everything</em> in Rails, but it’ll be part of the toolbox.</p><p>Before this, I hadn’t touched the stuff. And I bet a lot of people are like that - they came of age in the world of React and Go, and haven’t tried anything even remotely similar to Rails. For their benefit, and to debrief from 2020, here are some notes on the experience. Plus, <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">Rails-like projects in JavaScript</a> are ramping up quickly, and it’s fun to know the origins.</p><h2 id="the-good">The good</h2><h3 id="debugging-rails-apps-is-amazing">Debugging Rails apps is amazing</h3><p>A while ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1321133460501585922">wrote on Twitter</a></p><blockquote><p>the real reason why javascript developers don’t use breakpoints and use console.log is that breakpoints don’t work</p></blockquote><p>After years of working in JavaScript, I’m used to bad debugging experiences. The Chrome debugger’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/05/automatically-pause-on-any-exception">automatic pause on caught exceptions</a> is amazing, sometimes. But throwing a <code>debugger</code> statement in some React code is dodgy as hell. Sometimes it works, mostly it doesn’t. You have to deal with code that might not have the right <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">sourcemap</a> to translate from bundled &amp; minified code to original source. Subtle abstractions like React hooks and advanced transpiler stuff like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/regenerator">Regenerator</a> mean that your code’s stacktrace probably looks nothing like what you expect, with lots of internal garbage. Sure, you can learn better techniques for diagnosing and debugging errors, but it’s not just you - the debugging story in JavaScript is pretty bad. This applies even to Node.js, where one of the debugging stories is to connect Chrome’s debugger to a Node.js instance:&nbsp;a finicky solution that doesn’t consistently work.</p><p>In Rails, there is <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug">byebug</a>. You write <strong><code>byebug</code></strong> in your source code, and you get an interactive REPL right there. It works in views, controllers, database migrations, everywhere. It almost always works. Variables are named what you expect. The whole system is paused at that moment, and you can actually interact with it, using all of the Rails utilities and your installed gems.</p><p>If a page crashes unexpectedly, you get a similar REPL experience, in your browser, automatically. With an automatically cleaned-up stacktrace that excludes Rails’s own frames. Like the byebug interface, this REPL actually works and is consistently helpful in finding root causes. Rarely will you need to use <code>puts</code> to print something to the console because this debugging system is so good.</p><h3 id="the-magic-mostly-works">The magic mostly works</h3><p>Our Rails app didn’t have any <code>require</code> statements. You mention a module’s name, and it’s automatically included, using <a href="https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk">Zeitwork</a>, a tool that comes standard with Rails.</p><p>This kind of system was terrifying to me before. What if you accidentally import something just by mentioning it? What if two things have the same name and you import the wrong one? How do you really know what’s happening? Sure, you’re happy now, with all of that annoying importing and exporting taken care of, but the sky might fall.</p><p>Or maybe it just… doesn’t. Maybe impure, vaguely risky techniques are just a net positive over time, and making everything fully explicit isn’t really necessary? Now when I’m using other systems, I wonder - what if I could just mention one of my React components and it would just… be there? Sure, the system would have to complain if there were two components with the same name, and it would have to make assumptions about directory structure, but overall, wouldn’t this be nice?</p><p>This applies to a lot of other parts of the system too. Rails is famous for doing pluralization - you name a model <code>Post</code> and you automatically get an interface called <code>posts</code>. But what, you ask, of words with uneven pluralization rules? Rails actually&nbsp;<a href="https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/8/25/10-reasons-rails-does-pluralization/">does the right thing</a>, almost always. And when it fails, you can override it. It actually just saves time, reliably.</p><h3 id="testing-works">Testing works</h3><p>I’ve tried to test front-end applications. I’ve set up <a href="https://nightwatchjs.org/">nightwatch</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a>, <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/">enzyme</a>, <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a>, and probably 5-10 other frameworks. <em>Front-end testing is universally terrible.</em> Projects like Cypress are throwing untold hours into making it less terrible, taking on massive amounts of complexity to abstract away from fickle browser behavior and complex interactions.</p><p>But it still sucks. Frontend testing has no good attributes: it’s unreliable, hard to automate, hard to debug when it fails, and often doesn’t even assert for important behaviors, so it doesn’t actually identify regressions. Running frontend tests in CI is resource-heavy, requiring you to set up headless X windows environments on servers or use specialized CI services that produce screencasts of test runs.</p><p>Testing fully-server-rendered applications, on the other hand, is <em>amazing</em>. A vanilla testing setup with Rails &amp; <a href="https://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> can give you fast, stable, concise, and actually-useful test coverage. You can actually assert for behavior and navigate through an application like a user would. These tests are solving a simpler problem - making requests and parsing responses, without the need for a full browser or headless browser, without multiple kinds of state to track.</p><p>Not only do the tests work better, the testing culture is a completely different universe. There are entire books written about how to write RSpec tests that catch bugs, allow software evolution, and aren’t filled with boilerplate.</p><h3 id="gems-are-so-powerful">Gems are so powerful</h3><p>Powerful and dangerous.</p><p>I’m used to modules as they work in other systems - Python, Node, Elm, and so on. They provide objects, functions, and variables that you can import and combine into your code explicitly. Usually they sit on some specific level of abstraction - it’s a utility for connecting to servers or a React component you can use.</p><p>Gems can do so much more. You install something like <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a> into your system and it adds views, routes, methods, utilities, you name it. It’s not like “loading some functions”, it’s more like composing a whole different app <em>into</em> your app, implicitly.</p><p>This is obviously terrifying. It means that you can’t look at your directories of views and your file of <code>routes.rb</code> and know what exists at a glance. There are other layers, lurking in the ephemeral space of third-party code. They interact in serious but uncertain ways.</p><p>But it’s also pretty incredible - the idea that something like <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">passport</a>, Node’s middleware, could instead be a full-fledged authentication system. It means that you have to write a lot less code, and it also means that the people who <em>use</em> that code have a lot more code in common. That gems can work on a higher level of abstraction, making it possible to cobble together software faster, to write less ‘glue code.’</p><h3 id="theres-so-much-good-writing-about-rails">There’s so much good writing about Rails</h3><p>Even if you don’t write Ruby, you should pay attention to <a href="https://sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a>. She’s incredibly wise and has so many incredible ideas to share.</p><p>And then there’s <a href="https://blog.arkency.com/">arkency</a>, <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/">ThoughtBot</a>, and so many other thoughtful writers with years of experience in Rails. Sometimes it’s a little shocking to google for some obscure problem and see a decade of discussion about it.</p><p>The best practices are also formalized into tools like <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek">reek</a>. I’ve never seen so many actually-useful suggestions come out of automated systems as I did in the world of Ruby and Rails.</p><h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3><p>Ruby is a pretty pleasant language to work in. Sure, it has a lot of syntax and a sprawling standard library, but you don’t have to use all of that if you don’t want to. It took me a while to adjust to the object-oriented way of doing things - in particular, the idea that you can’t just have a free-range function floating out there, unassociated with a class or module, like you can in JavaScript. And you can’t just create an arbitrary one-off object - you either need to define a class to create an object, or use a Hash to store data.</p><p>But Ruby’s standard library isn’t that huge. I’ve seen JavaScript’s ‘standard library’ grow a lot too, and frankly it’s nice to have methods like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart"><code>String.prototype.padStart</code></a> instead of having every little thing in userspace. The only part that felt actively weird was <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/activesupport/versions/6.1.1">activesupport</a> - a gem that extends Ruby’s core objects, but is part of Rails. It felt weird to have <em>string</em> methods that would only work if your environment was Rails.</p><p>The <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> app for documentation rocketed from my pile of unused tools to an absolute must-have. In the world of Ruby and Rails, with <em>most</em> gems having pretty good, semi-standard documentation, you can search for, and get answers, super fast. The Ruby language documentation and the Rails documentation is absolutely great. The JavaScript equivalent - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> - pales in comparison.</p><h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2><h3 id="the-asset-pipeline">The asset pipeline</h3><p>Remember SASS and the YUI Compressor?

Sean Moriarity and I are glad to announce that the project we have been working on for the last 3 months, Nx, is finally <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx">publicly available on GitHub</a>. Our goal with Nx is to provide the foundation for Numerical Elixir.</p>
<p>
In this blog post, I am going to outline the work we have done so far, some of the design decisions, and what we are planning to explore next. If you are looking for other resources to learn about Nx, you can <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/034-jose-valim-reveals-project-nx/">hear me unveiling Nx on the ThinkingElixir podcast</a>.</p>
<h2>
  Nx</h2>
<p>
Nx is a multi-dimensional tensors library for Elixir with multi-staged compilation to the CPU/GPU. Let’s see an example:</p>

As you see, tensors have a type (s64) and a shape (2x2). Tensor operations are also done with the <code>Nx</code> module. To implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">the Softmax function</a>:</p>

<p>
The high-level features in Nx are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
Typed multi-dimensional tensors, where the tensors can be unsigned integers (<code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>), signed integers (<code>s8</code>, <code>s16</code>, <code>s32</code>, <code>s64</code>), floats (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>) and brain floats (<code>bf16</code>);    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor">Named tensors</a>, allowing developers to give names to each dimension, leading to more readable and less error prone codebases;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Automatic differentiation, also known as autograd. The <code>grad</code> function provides reverse-mode differentiation, useful for simulations, training probabilistic models, etc;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Tensors backends, which enables the main <code>Nx</code> API to be used to manipulate binary tensors, GPU-backed tensors, sparse matrices, and more;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Numerical definitions, known as <code>defn</code>, provide multi-stage compilation of tensor operations to multiple targets, such as highly specialized CPU code or the GPU. The compilation can happen either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT) with a compiler of your choice;    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For Python developers, <code>Nx</code> currently takes its main inspirations from <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code>Numpy</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax"><code>JAX</code></a> but packaged into a single unified library.</p>
<p>
Our initial efforts have focused on the underlying abstractions. For example, while Nx implements dense tensors out-of-the-box, we also want the same high-level API to be valid for sparse tensors. You should also be able to use all functions in the <code>Nx</code> module with tensors that are backed by Elixir binaries and with tensors that are stored directly in the GPU.</p>
<p>
By ensuring the underlying tensor backend is ultimately replaceable, we can build an ecosystem of libraries on top of Nx, and allow end-users to experiment with different backends, hardware, and approaches to run their software on.</p>
<p>
<em>Nx’s mascot is the Numbat, a marsupial native to southern Australia. Unfortunately the Numbat are endangered and it is estimated to be fewer than 1000 left. If you are excited about Nx, consider donating to Numbat conservation efforts, such as <a href="https://www.numbat.org.au/">Project Numbat</a> and <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/">Australian Wildlife Conservancy</a>.</em></p>
<h2>
Numerical definitions</h2>
<p>
One of the most important features in <code>Nx</code> is the numerical definition, called <code>defn</code>. Numerical definitions are a subset of Elixir tailored for numerical computing. Here is the <code>softmax</code> formula above, now written with <code>defn</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Formula</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Nx.Defn</span><span>

  </span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-2">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-3">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-6">)</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-5">)</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-3">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The first difference we see with <code>defn</code> is that Elixir’s built-in operators have been augmented to also work with tensors. Effectively, <code>defn</code> replaces Elixir’s <code>Kernel</code> with <code>Nx.Defn.Kernel</code>.</p>
<p>
However, <code>defn</code> goes even further. When using <code>defn</code>, <code>Nx</code> builds a computation with all of your tensor operations. Let’s inspect it:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0485630283-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>inspect_expr</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-3">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-6">)</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-5">)</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Now when invoked, you will see this printed:</p>

<p>
This computation graph can also be transformed programatically. The transformation is precisely how we implement automatic differentiation, also known as <code>autograd</code>, by traversing each node and computing their derivative:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>grad_softmax</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>grad</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-3">(</span><span>t</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-6">)</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-5">)</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Finally, this computation graph can also be handed out to different compilers. As an example, we have implemented bindings for <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/">Google’s XLA</a> compiler, called EXLA. We can ask the <code>softmax</code> function to use this new compiler with a module attribute:</p>
<pre><code><span>@defn_compiler</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">{</span><span>EXLA</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>client</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:host</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">}</span><span>
</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-2">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9487003846-3">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">)</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Once <code>softmax</code> is called, <code>Nx.Defn</code> will invoke <code>EXLA</code> to emit a just-in-time and highly-specialized compiled version of the code, tailored to the tensor type and shape. By passing <code>client: :cuda</code> or <code>client: :rocm</code>, the code can be compiled for the GPU. For reference, here are some benchmarks of the function above when called with a tensor of one million random float values on different clients:</p>

Where <code>keep</code> indicates the tensor was kept on the device instead of being transferred back to Elixir. You can see the benchmark in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/bench"><code>bench</code></a> directory and find some examples in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/examples"><code>examples</code></a> directory of the EXLA project.</p>
<h3>
Compiling numerical definitions</h3>
<p>
Before moving forward, it is important for us to take a look at how numerical definitions are compiled. For example, take the <code>softmax</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">)</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
One might think that Elixir takes the AST of the softmax function above and compiles it directly to the GPU. However, that’s not the case! Numerical definitions are first compiled to Elixir code that will emit the computation graph and this computation graph is then compiled to the GPU. The multiple stages go like this:</p>
<pre><code>Elixir AST
-&gt; compiles to .beam (Erlang VM bytecode)
   -&gt; executes into defn AST
      -&gt; compiles to GPU</code></pre>
<p>
This multi-stage programming is made possible thanks to Elixir macros. For example, when you see a conditional inside <code>defn</code>, that conditional looks exactly like Elixir conditionals, but it will be compiled to an accelerator:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">do</span><span>
    </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">else</span><span>
    </span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In a nutshell, <code>defn</code> provides us with a subset of Elixir for numerical computations that can be compiled to specific hardware, such as CPU, GPU, and other accelerators. All of this was possible without making changes or forking the language.</p>
<p>
And while <code>defn</code> is a subset of the language, it is a considerable one. You will find support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Mathematical operators  </li>
  <li>
Pipes (<code>|&gt;</code>), module attributes, the access syntax (i.e. <code>tensor[1][1..-1]</code>), etc  </li>
  <li>
Elixir macros constructs (imports, aliases, etc)  </li>
  <li>
Control-flow with conditionals (both <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code>), loops (coming soon), etc  </li>
  <li>
Transformations, an explicit mechanism to invoke Elixir code from a <code>defn</code> (which enables constructs such as <code>grad</code>)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
And more coming down the road.</p>
<h2>
Why functional programming?</h2>
<p>
At this point, you may be wondering: is functional programming a good fit for numerical computing? One of the main concerns is that immutability can be expensive when working with large blobs of memory. And that’s a valid concern! In fact, when using the default tensor backend, tensors will be backed by Elixir binaries which are copied on every operation. That’s why it was critical for us to design <code>Nx</code> with pluggable backends from day one.</p>
<p>
However, as we move to higher-level abstractions, such as numerical definitions, we will start to reap the benefits of functional programming.</p>
<p>
For example, in order to build computation graphs, immutability becomes an indispensable tool both in terms of implementation and reasoning. The JAX library for Python, which has been one of the guiding lights for Nx design, also promotes functional and immutable principles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>JAX is intended to be used with a functional style of programming</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.ops.html?highlight=functional#indexed-update-operators">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>Unlike NumPy arrays, JAX arrays are always immutable</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html?highlight=immutable#JAX-vs.-NumPy">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, frameworks like <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc.ai</a> argue that functional programming can provide better abstractions and more composable building blocks for deep learning libraries.</p>
<p>
We hope that, by exploring these concepts in a language that is functional by design, Elixir can bring new ideas and insights at the higher-level.</p>

What is next?</h2>

There is a lot of work ahead of us and we definitely cannot …</p></article></div></div>

that can help get us oriented. The answer will also undoubtedly depend on <em>who</em>

an individual, the answer will also depend on their primary skillset: a

Do you have a sense of what game mechanics
your game will have? Do you know what genre, controls, and themes this game will
have?</p><p>If <em>yes</em>, you’re ready to decide <strong><a href="#start-coding">where to start coding</a></strong>.
Otherwise, you have a few more questions to ask yourself.</p><h3>Do you <em>want</em> to know what you’re building?</h3><p>It’s totally fine not to have a project in mind! Maybe you’re prototyping.
Perhaps you’re throwing a bunch of mini-games on the wall and seeing what
sticks. Or you’re looking for inspiration and trying to implement random
mechanics to see what feels fun.</p><p><strong>If you’re hoping to begin working on a specific, cohesive game</strong>, you will
likely want to know what you’re building. Consider brainstorming and sketching
out an informal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document">game design document</a>.
There are
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=game+design+document+template">plenty of templates</a>
of various levels of detail you could decide to use. Especially as a software
engineer toying with abstract ideas in my brain, I’ll start with a super
high-level GDD, covering the feel, themes, genre, and mechanics of the game I
have in mind. Maybe a few pictures or sketches for inspiration, and that’s it.
The key part of this exercise will be the list of mechanics I’m working on.</p><p><strong>If you want to prototype and experiment</strong>, you should already have a vague
sense of 1-2 mechanics that could be fun: Maybe unusual movement or a different
control scheme. It could be a traditional mechanic that you’re wondering how to
implement. For instance, I might decide to build a 3rd Person character and
camera controller to see the “feel” of it, experiment with it a tiny bit, and do
something smooth and polish that I feel good about. I might end up keeping that
code in my back pocket for later, or I might use play-through sessions with that
controller to move around a scene, add a few assets, and use that as a starting
place to see the “feel” various mechanics and designs.</p><h2 id="start-coding">I know the mechanics I care about. Now what?</h2><figure><p><span>

development. You do that by failing fast and getting feedback early. In game
development, the primary metric for success is a feeling: the game should be
fun. So, when deciding what to start with when working on a game, one good
question to ask is: <em>“How can I see if this game is fun as soon as possible?”</em>
or <em>“How can I implement the ‘fun’ part of the game ASAP?”</em></p><p>One way to do that is to look at a game’s mechanics and implement them in some
order. The advice that resonates with me is implementing game mechanics in order
of what the most <em>“core”</em> mechanic first.</p><figure><p><span>

plane shooting game—as an example. Here’s my attempt at writing its main
mechanics in descending order of importance:</p><ol><li>Movement: Navigate a vertically scrolling world</li><li>Obstacles &amp; Dodging: Player can collide with stationary obstacles and debris</li><li>Shooting: Player can shoot straight ahead to defeat obstacles</li><li>Enemies: Enemies are moving obstacles that can shoot back</li><li>Player Health: A player can take a finite number of hits before losing the
game</li><li>Enemy Health: Some enemies take multiple shots to destroy</li><li>Boosts: The player can pick up boosts that improve health, shooting, etc.</li></ol><p>… and so on.</p><p>If I’m trying to develop <em>1945</em> from scratch, I will implement that list in that
order. The game’s mechanics build on each other, so I can only tell if shooting
is “fun” is if I can move around the screen and if there are obstacles I’m
trying to clear (otherwise, there’s no urgency to just pressing <em>Space</em> and
seeing projectiles coming out of a plane).</p><p>In simpler games, we might order our mechanics so that every new feature adds to
a game’s feel. So, with every new mechanic you add, you can play the game and
tell if it’s adding what you hope for it to add.</p><p>In more complex games, some of the “core” mechanics might be too ‘standard’ to
be “risky” <em>per se</em>, but you’ll still need the core mechanics implemented to
assess how fun the other mechanics are. You might choose to use a simpler
throwaway implementation, like a few lines of input-handling code and Unity’s
<code>CharacterController</code> component. You’ll want your core mechanics just smooth
enough that they don’t ruin the fun of the things you’ll layer on top of it.
Another approach here is to use the asset store. I’ve previously mentioned the
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/ufps-ultimate-fps-106748?aid=1011leWs6">Ultimate FPS (UFPS)</a>
asset, which you might choose to use when building an FPS game, and move on to
implementing the combat or some more unique (but still “core” feature of the
gameplay first).</p><h2>So I picked a mechanic, but where do I start programming <em>within</em> this mechanic?</h2><p><em>Within</em> a mechanic, your traditional software engineering intuition becomes
helpful. I hope to spend subsequent articles discussing patterns that are
especially helpful in Unity, but here are a few to consider:</p><ul><li>Work within Unity’s Object-Component paradigm. If you’re adding a new
<em>capability</em> to your player, write it as its own component.</li><li><em>Tuning</em> is especially important in game development; representing a
mechanic’s interesting pieces as <em>configurable</em>, <em>serializable</em> data that
can be input to a component will help you playtest and iterate.</li><li>Don’t shy away from using plain-old data objects to represent core concepts
you’re working with. E.g., health, ammo information, or powerups. Make it
serializable if you want it passed around in the editor (or saved to disk
across sessions).</li><li>Where pieces of a concept don’t correspond to a single object in a scene,
consider using Scriptable Objects to do the jobs. Scriptable Objects
introduce many patterns that might help represent what you’re doing.</li></ul><p>A few articles I have already written might prove helpful:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts/">Basic Concepts in Unity for Software Engineers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices/">6 Software Practices to Keep, Shed, and Adopt in Unity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/09/patterns-in-unity-adventure-tutorial/">Making Sense of Patterns in Unity’s Adventure Game Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt5-object-component/">Understanding Unity Engine Objects</a></li></ul><p>You might also take a look at patterns covered in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">Three ways to architect your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,

data and abstractions, the reader’s initial comment also becomes the answer:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond learning about useful patterns and abstractions in game development to
make development clearer and cleaner, the real takeaway is to decide <em>what</em> to
work on at a macro-level.</p><h2>How much time should I spend on one mechanic?</h2><p>As you’re developing a mechanic, what’s a good signal you should move on to the
next on your list? Generally, that would be when you’re convinced:</p><ul><li>This mechanic <em>feels fun</em> and <em>adds to the game</em>,</li><li>Your implementation adds <em>just the
<a href="https://www.e4developer.com/2018/11/21/having-just-the-right-amount-of-technical-debt/">right amount</a></em>
of technical debt.</li></ul><p>Traditionally, folks will often say to worry about polish at the later stages of
your development. In his GDC 2016 micro-talk <em>“Pizzazz First, Polish Later”</em>,
Lee Perry makes a distinction in this traditional wisdom.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8QAVGeEj-U?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Certain levels of pizzazz might give you a better sense of your mechanic and how
fun it feels. A certain amount of polish or pizzazz can also help you see your
game in a new light and motivate you to keep going.
<a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/squeezing-more-juice-out-of-your-game-design/">Juice</a>
is another form of pizzazz; in certain dull moments of your game design, adding
juice might be a low-cost way to get back into the groove of things.</p><p>I hope the conflicting advice shows there isn’t a silver bullet on what to add
when. Rather—as in traditional software development—this choice is about a
series of trade-offs that depend on the developer, the project, and lots more.</p><h2>Are you developing a game or architecting systems?</h2><p>For some software engineers, we’re often drawn to writing code for systems that
seem <em>interesting</em>. Sometimes, I have a game in mind, but <em>really</em>, I’m
interested in implementing a cool inventory system where <em>everything</em> in the
game is an item. It might not be the core mechanic, but it might be the thing I
want to build.</p><p>It’s important to recognize when you’re not building a game but building a
system. If you just quit your job to be a full-time indie gamedev and have a
year of runway before your run out of cash, it is probably a bad idea to start
building a complex inventory system that you don’t even know you’ll need<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
But if you’re programming on the side to flex your game development muscle, then
go right at it.</p><hr><p>I don’t think I’m qualified <em>per se</em> to answer the …</p></div></div>

<!--truncate-->

<h2>Why libbpf and BPF CO-RE?</h2>
<p>Historically, <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/">BCC</a> was a framework of choice when you had to develop a BPF application that required peering into the internals of kernel when implementing all sorts of tracing BPF programs. BCC provided a built-in Clang compiler that could compile your BPF code in runtime, tailoring it to a specific target kernel on the host. This was the only way to develop a maintainable BPF application that had to deal with internals of ever-changing kernel. See <a href="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf-portability-and-co-re.html">“BPF Portability and CO-RE”</a> post, which does a better and more detailed job explaining why is that so and why BCC was previously pretty much the only viable choice. It also explains why <a href="https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf">libbpf</a> is a good choice now. Libbpf over last year got a major boost in capabilities and sophistication, closed many existing gaps with BCC, especially for tracing applications, and also gained lots of new and powerful features not available in BCC (for instance, global variables and BPF skeletons).</p>
<p>Granted, BCC is going to great lengths to simplify BPF developer’s life, but sometimes that extra convenience gets in the way and makes it actually harder to figure out what’s wrong and how to fix it. It feels like BCC simply has too much magic at times. You have to remember naming conventions and auto-generated structs for tracepoints. You have to rely on code rewriting to read kernel data and fetch kprobe arguments. You’ll write a semi-object-oriented C code when working with BPF maps, which doesn’t exactly match what really happens in kernel. And despite all the magic, BCC will still make you write a bunch of boilerplate code in user-space part of your application, setting up most trivial pieces by hand.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, BCC relies on runtime compilation and brings the entire huge LLVM/Clang library in and embeds it inside itself. This has many consequences, all of which are less than ideal:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy resource utilization (both memory and CPU) during compilation, potentially disrupting main workflow on a busy server;</li>
<li>dependency on kernel headers package, that has to be installed on every target host. And even then, if you need something from kernel that is not exposed through public headers – you’ll need to copy/paste type definitions into your BPF code by hand to get your work done;</li>
<li>even a trivial compilation-time errors are detecte only during the runtime, after you’ve rebuilt and restarted your user-space application completely; this significantly reduces development iteration time (and increases frustration levels...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Libbpf + BPF CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere) chose a different way. Their philosophy is that BPF programs are not much different from any “normal” user-space program: they ought to be compiled once into small binaries and then deployed unmodified in a compact form to target hosts. Libbpf plays the role of BPF program loader, performing mundane set up work (relocations, loading and verifying BPF programs, creating BPF maps, attaching to BPF hooks, etc), letting developers worry only about BPF program correctness and performance. Such approach keeps overhead to the minimum, eliminates heavy dependencies, makes overall developer experience much more pleasant.</p>
<p>In terms of APIs and code conventions, libbpf sticks to the philosophy of the least surprise, which means that most of the things have to be spelled out explicitly: there won’t be any implicitly included headers and no code rewriting. Just plain C code and a healthy dose of helper macro to eliminate most mundane parts. Other than that, what you write is what gets executed and the structure of your BPF application is 1-to-1 with what kernel ultimately verifies and executes.</p>
<p>These guidelines were written to make BCC to libbpf + BPF CO-RE conversion process easier, faster, and less painful. They explain various preliminary set up steps, outline common patterns, explains differences, problems, and gotchas, which you inevitably will encounter due to differences between BCC and libbpf.</p>
<p>Switching from BCC to vanilla libbpf + BPF CO-RE might feel unusual and confusing at first, but you’ll get a hang of it pretty quickly and will appreciate libbpf’s explicitness and straightforwardness next time you run into a compilation or verification problem.</p>
<p><em>Also, keep in mind that a bunch of Clang features used for BPF CO-RE are pretty new, so you’ll need a Clang 10 or newer to make all this work.</em></p>
<h2>Setting up user-space parts</h2>
<h3>Building everything</h3>
<p>Building libbpf-based BPF application using BPF CO-RE consists of few steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>generating <code>vmlinux.h</code> header file with all kernel types;</li>
<li>compiling your BPF program source code using recent Clang (version 10 or newer) into <code>.o</code> object file;</li>
<li>generating BPF skeleton header file from compiled BPF object file;</li>
<li>including generated BPF skeleton header to use from user-space code;</li>
<li>then, at last, compiling user-space code, which will get BPF object code embedded in it, so that you don’t have to distribute extra files with your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>How exactly this is done will depend on your specific setup and build system, which can’t be addressed here in enough details. For one way to do this please check <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/libbpf-tools">BCC’s libbpf-tools</a>, which set up a generic Makefile rules that take care of all this for you in a succinct manner.</p>
<p>When BPF code is compiled and BPF skeleton is generated, include libbpf and skeleton headers in your user-space code to have necessary APIs ready to be used:</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;bpf/bpf.h&gt;</span></span>
<span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;bpf/libbpf.h&gt;</span></span>
<span>#<span>include</span> <span>"path/to/your/skeleton.skel.h"</span></span>
</code></pre>
<h3>Locked memory limits</h3>
<p>BPF is using locked memory for BPF maps and various other things. By default, this limit is very low, so unless it’s increased, even a trivial BPF program won’t load successfully into kernel. BCC unconditionally sets this limit to infinity, but libbpf doesn’t do this automatically (by design).</p>
<p>Depending on your production environment, there might be better and more preferred ways of doing this. But for quick experimentation or if there is no better way of doing this, you can do it yourself through <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit(2)</a> syscall, which should be called at the very beginning of your program:</p>
<pre><code>    <span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</span></span>

    rlimit rlim = {
        .rlim_cur = <span>512U</span>L &lt;&lt; <span>20</span>, 
        .rlim_max = <span>512U</span>L &lt;&lt; <span>20</span>, 
    };

    err = setrlimit(RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, &amp;rlim);
    <span>if</span> (err)
        
</code></pre>
<h3>Libbpf log</h3>
<p>When something doesn’t work as expected, the best way to start investigating is to look at libbpf log output. Libbpf outputs a bunch of useful logs at various levels of verbosity. By default, libbpf will emit error-level output to console. We recommend installing a custom logging callback and set up ability to turn on/off verbose debug-level output:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>print_libbpf_log</span><span>(<span>enum</span> libbpf_print_level lvl, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *fmt, va_list args)</span> </span>{
    <span>if</span> (!FLAGS_bpf_libbpf_debug &amp;&amp; lvl &gt;= LIBBPF_DEBUG)
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    <span>return</span> <span>vfprintf</span>(<span>stderr</span>, fmt, args);
}



libbpf_set_print(print_libbpf_log); 
</code></pre>
<h3>BPF skeleton and BPF app lifecycle</h3>
<p>Detailed explanation of using BPF skeleton (and libbpf API in general) is beyond the scope of this document, existing <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/tree/tools/testing/selftests/bpf">kernel selftests</a> and BCC <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/libbpf-tools">libbpf-tools examples</a> are probably the best way to get a feel for it. Check out <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/libbpf-tools/runqslower.c">runqslower</a> example as a simple but real tool utilizing skeleton.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s useful to explain main libbpf concepts and phases that each BPF application goes through. BPF application consists of a set of BPF programs, either co-operating or completely independent, and BPF maps and global variables, shared between all BPF programs (allowing them to co-operate on common set of data). BPF maps and global variables are also accessible from user-space (we interchangeably refer to user-space part of application as a “control app”), allowing control app to get or set any extra data necessary. BPF application typically goes through the following phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open phase.</strong> BPF object file is parsed: BPF maps, BPF programs, and global variables are discovered, but not yet created. After a BPF app is opened, it’s possible to make any additional adjustments (setting BPF program types, if necessary; pre-setting initial values for global variables, etc), before all the entities are created and loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Load phase.</strong> BPF maps are created, various relocations are resolved, BPF programs are loaded into the kernel and verified. At this point, all the parts of a BPF application are validated and exist in kernel, but no BPF program is yet executed. After the load phase, it’s possible to set up initial BPF map state without racing with the BPF program code execution.</li>
<li><strong>Attachment phase.</strong> This is the phase at which BPF programs get attached to various BPF hook points (e.g., tracepoints, kprobes, cgroup hooks, network packet processing pipeline, etc). This is the phase at which BPF starts performing useful work and read/update BPF maps and global variables.</li>
<li><strong>Tear down phase</strong>. BPF programs are detached and unloaded from kernel. BPF maps are destroyed and all the resources used by BPF app are freed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generated BPF skeleton has corresponding functions to trigger each phase:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;name&gt;__open()</code> – creates and opens BPF application;</li>
<li><code>&lt;name&gt;__load()</code> – instantiates, loads, and verifies BPF application parts;</li>
<li><code>&lt;name&gt;__attach()</code> – attaches all auto-attachable BPF programs (it’s optional, you can have more control by using libbpf APIs directly);</li>
<li><code>&lt;name&gt;__destroy()</code> – detaches all BPF programs and frees up all used resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>BPF code conversion</h2>
<p>In this part, we’ll go over typical conversion flow and will outline typical mismatches between how BCC and libbpf/BPF CO-RE do things. Hopefully, this will make it easy for you to convert your BPF code to be both BCC- and BPF CO-RE compatible.</p>
<h3>Detecting BCC vs libbpf modes</h3>
<p>For cases where you’ll need to support both BCC and libbpf "modes", it’s useful to be able to detect which mode BPF program code is compiled for. Simplest way to do this is to rely on the presence of <code>BCC_SEC</code> macro in BCC:</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>ifdef</span> BCC_SEC</span>
<span>#<span>define</span> __BCC__</span>
<span>#<span>endif</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>After …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

  <p><a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/node/websockets">WebSockets</a> are a great tool for when you want to show real time changes in data.
For example, a server can push stock market price changes to the client rather than the client needing to ask for the changes via a HTTP request.
With this being said, below you will find an example of a simple Vue application that shows the current time to the user and where
the user can send a simple message to the websocket.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>const</span> app = <span>new</span> Vue({
    <span>data</span>: <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> ({ <span>time</span>: <span>null</span> }),
    <span>template</span>: <span>`
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;{{time}}&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    `</span>,
    <span>mounted</span>: <span><span>function</span>(<span></span>)</span>{
      <span>let</span> connection = <span>new</span> WebSocket(<span>'ws://localhost:3000/'</span>);
      connection.onmessage = <span>(<span>event</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        
        
        
        <span>this</span>.time = event.data;
      }
    }
  });
  app.$mount(<span>"#content"</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Below is an example websocket server that you can use with the above Vue code.</p>
<pre><code><span>"use strict"</span>;

<span>const</span> serverPort = <span>3000</span>;
<span>const</span> express = <span>require</span>(<span>"express"</span>);
<span>const</span> http = <span>require</span>(<span>"http"</span>);
<span>const</span> WebSocket = <span>require</span>(<span>"ws"</span>);

<span>const</span> app = express();
<span>const</span> server = http.createServer(app);
<span>const</span> websocketServer = <span>new</span> WebSocket.Server({ server });


websocketServer.on(<span>"connection"</span>, (webSocketClient) =&gt; {
  
  webSocketClient.send(<span>"The time is: "</span>);
  setInterval(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>let</span> time = <span>new</span> <span>Date</span>();
    webSocketClient.send(<span>"The time is: "</span> + time.toTimeString());
  }, <span>1000</span>);
});


server.listen(<span>3000</span>, () =&gt; {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>"Websocket server started on port 3000"</span>);
});</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10783" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"> <div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://opium.finance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opium Finance</a> has released collateralized debt obligation products (CDOs) for Compound Finance’s automated lending markets, Opium Protocol founder Andrey Belyakov told CoinDesk in a phone interview Friday.</p><div id="node-1"><p>Investors can put up the Compound debt token cDai – and soon Uniswap LP tokens – to diversify exposure to DeFi lending markets. Opium’s product pays out structured returns to both a senior and junior risk tranche in exchange. The former tranche offers a 7% fixed return on <a target="_blank" data-for="autolink" data-tip="DAI" href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/dai">dai</a> (a collateral-backed stablecoin) at maturity, while the latter pool offers a variable rate paid out after filling up the senior tranche’s return, a <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@andreybelyakov/50028fde8811" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> shared with CoinDesk states.</p><p><a href="https://businessblockchainhq.com/blockchain-e-books/blockchain-e-book-supply-chain/"><img src="https://businessblockchainhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/supplychain-ebook.jpg?ad1fd1&amp;ad1fd1" alt="" width="728" height="96"></a></p></div><p>As depicted in Michael Lewis’ “The Big Short,”<em> </em>CDOs are infamous for their role in monetizing the subprime mortgage crisis that spurred the 2008 financial crisis. Warren Buffet even went as far to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fintools.com/docs/Warren%20Buffet%20on%20Derivatives.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">call</a> CDOs and other derivatives “financial weapons of mass destruction” years before the financial downturn. CDO holders lost out on expected payments when mortgage holders defaulted en masse. Banks that were over leveraged on the then-worthless debt obligations began to default themselves, such as failed financial giant <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bear Stearns</a>.</p><p>It’s thought the transparent nature of blockchain-based financial applications could limit the downside of using these complex derivatives. Moreover, the risk profile of the average DeFi lending app is vastly different than the reasons CDOs became a household name over a decade ago. DeFi apps have little chance of becoming insolvent due to programmatic liquidation settings. Rather, the risk mostly comes down to software exploits which many poorly put-together DeFi apps experienced this past year.&nbsp;</p><p>Belyakov said risk tranching increases the efficiency of capital on lending markets – a poorly understood problem in young DeFi markets he thinks derivatives can help address.</p><p>It works as follows: A protocol issues a debt token representing a claim to funds deposited or “locked” on a DeFi app, such as cDai. These debt tokens allow those same deposits to gain exposure again on other markets. However, most DeFi investors let these debt tokens sit idle in wallets, re-invest them as collateral for other loans or put them up for yield farming. The problem is these bets often move in the same direction. Placing debt tokens into Opium’s CDO, on the other hand, acts as a categorical alternative to other forms of capital exposure, Belyakov said.</p><p>“What we did was look at the lowest-hanging fruit,” Belyakov said. “And we found that Uniswap LP tokens, Compound cDai and some others are just stored on a wallet; they are not being used as collateral or farming – you don’t utilize this capital.”</p><div id="node-12"><p>The derivative joins other early attempts to protect lenders from the software risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi). For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saffron.finance/#home" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saffron Finance</a> launched its unaudited protocol in November while little-known protocol <a target="_blank" href="https://barnbridge.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barn Bridge</a> continues to build out an offering similar to Opium’s. The protocol also <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.coindesk.com/credit-default-swaps-tether-opium">released</a> a credit default swap (CDS) product for the <a target="_blank" data-for="autolink" data-tip="USDT" href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/tether">tether</a> stablecoin in September.</p><p><a href="https://businessblockchainhq.com/blockchain-jobs/" target="parent"><img alt="Blockchain jobs in United States and Canada" src="https://businessblockchainhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain-jobs2.jpg?ad1fd1&amp;ad1fd1"></a></p></div><p>Opium is also jumping on the governance token bandwagon. The protocol released its opium (OPIUM) token Monday for decentralizing the protocol’s governance structure. The launch was preceded by a premine and a $3.5 million private sale including participation from venture capitalist Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital, QCP Soteria, HashKey and Alameda Research, among others.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/collateralized-debt-obligations-cdos-defi-lending" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div></div> </article></div>]]>

          <p>China’s first variety show about computer programmers seeks to mold Chinese IT idols </p>

<p>Photo: screenshot of the show posted by the Ant Group on Sina Weibo</p><p>&nbsp;Following in the footsteps of singers, dancers and other comedians, now computer programmers have gotten their own competitive reality show in China. Sponsored by the Ant Group, Ranshaoba tiancaichengxuyuan, which roughly translates to Burn Bright! Genius Programmer, seeks to display a different side of Chinese IT talents, who are often at the center of public discussion because of their heavy workloads.</p><p>The first reality competition to focus on programmers in China, the two-episode series debuted on Chinese streaming platforms on January 12.</p><p>Twenty programmers took part in the show, which divided them into four teams that competed to win a prize of 1 million yuan ($154,152). Some of the competitors were graduates of top universities such as Tsinghua University in China and Carnegie Mellon University in the US, while others were high school dropouts.&nbsp;</p><p>The 20 contestants tasked with protecting wild animals from poachers in a virtual world. Contestants needed to design a set of artificial intelligence (AI) models that could detect and identify wild animals based on the limited data resources in the game.</p><p>Each team only had 48 hours to finish the "game" and the one that earned the highest score by stopping the most poachers won the prize.</p><p>Four top experts on information technology, who are also professors at Peking University and Tsinghua University, were acted as mentors to these young talents on the show.</p><p>The experience of some contestants stunned viewers. For instance, Tong Yongao, who also has a PhD in biology, had previously won the Capture the Flag event, an international information security technology challenge, with his team and currently is developing anti-cyber crime products, Chinese news site The Paper reported.</p><p>Another contestant He Liren learned programming by himself at a small internet bar in Hefei, East China's Anhui Province, after dropping out of high school 10 years ago. Competing with 19 other talented individuals from top universities, he impressed audiences with his creative ideas and professional skills.</p><p>Some netizens drawn in by the show commented on social media that even though they couldn't completely understand what the programmers in the show were doing, the competitors ignited their passion for the IT field.</p><p>"They are very different from the image of programmers I had in my imagination. Social media says programmers always wear plaid shirts and are losing their hair because of their too heavy workload. But in the show, these programmers are brilliant, talented and deeply love their job," one netizen wrote on Sina Weibo.</p><p>In many netizens' eyes, the show has torn apart the labels given many Chinese programmers.</p><p>However, some audiences said they lost interest in the show after watching for a while since the content was too IT orientated.&nbsp;</p><p>Fang, a worker in the IT field in Beijing who just started his own company in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Tuesday that he is interested in the show and will watch it when he has the chance.</p><p>"I want to see my job from another angle and figure out what other people think about it," he said, praising the concept of the show.</p><p>A series of incidents, including the sudden death of a 23-year-old employee at China's e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, have created controversy for Chinese internet companies and raised questions for the industry, leading to netizens calling for companies to find a balance between turning a profit and taking care of employees.&nbsp;</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>(<em>original title</em>: "Curry Howard is a scam". See below.)</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard correspondence</a>
has been talked about a lot recently, not only in Haskell circles, but also
among CiC-based proof assistant practitioners (Coq, Lean, etc.).
In a nutshell, it makes a deep parallel between "programs" (terms of some flavor
of lambda calculus, typically), and "proofs" (these programs are a proof of their type,
or more precisely they are witnesses that their types are inhabited).
The most basic example is <code>id x = x</code> which, in Haskell, would be a proof of
$ \forall a. a \rightarrow a $, a trivial theorem of propositional logic.</p>
<p>That's all good and well, but my point here is that <em>in practice</em>, the equivalence is
not as interesting as it first looks.</p>
<h2 id="programs-are-not-really-proofs">Programs are not really proofs</h2>
<p>A real program (i.e. one that is written to be executed and do something useful)
is not really a proof of anything interesting.
Pedantically, a haskell program has type <code>IO ()</code>, which is not really a valid
proposition. But even beyond that, if we look just below the surface of <code>main</code>,
nothing has that interesting a type:</p>
<p>A classic Haskell program that is used by people is <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.
Most of what it does could be described as <code>Doc Markdown -&gt; Doc Html</code> (or
a similar pair of document formats). So you have a "proof" that these two trees
can be somehow mapped onto one another. No mathematician will fawn over that.</p>
<p>Servers written in Haskell, like webservers, would have the type <code>request -&gt; IO response</code>
(or something close to that, maybe <code>request -&gt; M response</code> for some custom monad <code>M</code>)
if you look inside the server loop. Again that's not really mathematically interesting.</p>
<p>It's only if you look in combinator libraries (like Parsec, say) that types get more generic,
and start looking more like formulas. Things like <code>flip : (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c</code>
are as generic as it gets… and are proofs of super trivial propositional logic theorems.
In fact you can't even state much in Haskell, any real mathematical statement will at least
require first-order logic (which corresponds to dependent types — no mainstream
language features these beyond, er, C++). Idris could <em>possibly</em>
have some interesting proofs that are also real programs… if it were designed to
be a proof assistant and not a beefed-up programming language.</p>
<p>If anyone has a useful program that is also actually a proof of something non
trivial, I'd be happy to be proven wrong.</p>
<h2 id="proofs-are-not-really-programs">Proofs are not really programs</h2>
<p>What is the program corresponding to a proof of
"there exists an infinite number of primes"?
If I run this program, what input does it takes, and what do I get as an
output?</p>
<p>I don't have a direct answer to that question. If you develop this proof in Coq,
using a <code>Prop</code> typed statement, I don't even think it could be extracted to OCaml
and compiled.</p>
<p>For most of mathematics, I have no idea what the "programs" corresponding to proofs
found in textbooks would look like, nor what they would compute. There are
very complicated lambda terms for these proofs, but what they compute is
unclear.</p>
<h3 id="a-concession">A concession</h3>
<p>A domain where CH <strong>does</strong> make sense to me, is algorithms (written in a functional
style) that are used as <em>existential witnesses</em> of some property.
For example, the Euclid GCD algorithm is, in a very real sense, a proof that
two natural numbers have a GCD. You can write some Coq or Lean code that
computes the GCD of two numbers and proves that it's indeed their greatest divisor.</p>
<p>That said, I don't know of any large program written this way. It's a labor intensive
way of writing programs, even compared to alternatives like <a href="https://why3.lri.fr/">why3</a>
where you can cleanly separate the code and the specification, and ask automatic provers
to do as much proving as possible for you.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-about-compcert-sel4">But what about Compcert/SEL4/… ?</h2>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://compcert.inria.fr/">Compcert</a>, famously one of the largest
programs written in Coq.
I suppose the main type is <code>compile : C_program -&gt; Option Asm_program</code>
or something like that (I'm no expert on Compcert so I could be very wrong).
However, as far as I know, it's not written in a purely dependent style: proofs are
separated from the "real code" part of the development. This means
we don't get $\forall x: \text{C_program} \rightarrow Option \set{y : \text{ASM_program} | R(x,y) }$
where $R(x,y)$ would mean that $x$ and $y$ have the same semantics; rather you
have <code>C_program -&gt; ASM_program</code> and proofs on the side that the function preserves
its input's semantic.</p>
<p>For SEL4 it's developed with Isabelle/HOL, which isn't dependently typed
and is classical logic.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The title was click-baity, of course 🙂. But I do think that CH is over-hyped,
because the correspondence is <del>only</del> mostly interesting abstractly; in practice things
are either a (interesting) program, or a (interesting) proof, but not both
at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> (2021-02-24):  I regret the over-aggressive title now. Changing it to the
more appropriate "CH is overrated"; it's obviously still a useful mathematical statement
and a valid way of building proofs.</p>

deal in urban transport," as people grappled with "the last mile problem," Wilson said.</p>  <p>"What I think Dean Kamen saw early on was cities were only getting bigger, they were only getting more congested, and we really needed some sort of device for that last mile — to get to work, maybe even to get from the subway to work," he said.</p>  <p>"Right now, you look at bike shares, you look at

Vancouver, thinks "the pandemic has given us opportunities to rethink how we get around safely in a lot of ways," as people try to find alternatives to sharing confined space on public transport.</p>  <p>"It's been particularly good for walking and simple biking, and e-biking is just an extension of human-powered biking, as are scooters," he told <em>The Current</em>.</p>    <p>That's leading to a boom in micro mobility, which Toderian defined as moving away from relying on cars and finding "more ways to get around that are small that we can carry with us, like foldable bikes."</p>

viewing micro mobility as the only solution to building healthier urban spaces.</p>  <p>"The concept of a more multimodal city&nbsp;—&nbsp;a city that has many more enjoyable, healthy, sustainable, economical, equitable ways of getting around&nbsp;— is going to be a lot of solutions," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Micro mobility … is part of a larger conversation about more and better ways to get

		<section itemprop="articlebody">
			<p>This article is the second entry of series of posts exploring situations in which <abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr> alone isn’t enough to secure user freedom.</p>
<p>My previous article, <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">Whatsapp and the domestication of users</a>, got more attention than I was expecting. Some responses gave me a lot to think about,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> especially regarding <em>actions</em> we can take. I suggest reading that article first; it explained what “user domestication” is and why it’s a problem. It enumerated three countermeasures: FOSS, simplicity, and open platforms.</p>
<p>Hard problems, by definition, lack easy solutions. Simply choosing (or creating) a platform that avoids user domestication isn’t enough if that platform can change. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance; in addition to settling on the right platform, we must ensure that it honors its users in both the present <em>and the future</em>. Keeping a platform FOSS and simple is more straightforward<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> than keeping a platform “open”.</p>
<p>How do we keep an open platform from becoming a closed platform in the future?</p>
<h2 id="how-open-platforms-become-closed">How open platforms become closed</h2>
<p>There are three ways to close an open platform:</p>
<ol>
<li>A forced migration onto a different platform.</li>
<li>A single implementation growing dominant, blurring the line between specification and implementation.</li>
<li>Dominant implementations adopting too many unstandardized features and behaviors.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three approaches overlap: they frequently feature platform monoculture and a single vendor controlling both clients and servers.</p>
<h3 id="forced-migration">Forced migration</h3>
<p>When one vendor controls all parts of a service (e.g., both a client and server), it has the means to create what I call a <strong><dfn>boxed platform</dfn>:</strong> a subset of a larger open platform that can evolve at its own pace, without concern for compatibility or interoperability.</p>
<p>Controlling both the server and client allows a vendor to update the client and server without worrying about breaking compatibility with other clients/servers in the larger network. It could update the client to point users to a server that uses a completely different, closed protocol. This is what happened to many XMPP users in the early 2000s.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-the-boxing-of-xmpp">Case study: the boxing of XMPP</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">XMPP</a> (formerly known as Jabber) is an open and federated instant-messaging protocol; anybody can set up their own XMPP server and talk to users on different XMPP servers, preventing one organization from owning the platform. Between 2005 and 2014, many proprietary chat platforms supported it: Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Facebook Chat (later known as Facebook Messenger), and Skype were some well-known examples. Some of these platforms even enabled server-to-server federation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, users of these proprietary services were boxed. Not many Google Talk users talked to Skype users, and Skype users didn’t typically talk to AIM users. Users stayed in their own sub-platforms. The result was that all users limited themselves to talking exclusively using their provider’s software: one provider controlled the entire messaging flow, from a sender’s client to the server to a recipient’s client. <strong>Users were only ever exposed to a single XMPP implementation offered by a single provider.</strong></p>
<p>Each of the listed platforms eventually locked in their users by migrating away from XMPP. This wouldn’t have been possible if multiple implementations and providers interacted with each other. Imagine Bob uses BobClient and BobServer to talk to Alice, and Alice uses AliceClient and AliceServer. BobClient, BobServer, AliceClient, and AliceServer would all have to remain compatible and use the same protocol; a forced migration would be unlikely to occur since it would break compatibility.</p>
<p>Compare the situation with email: despite Gmail’s dominance, other email providers remain popular. Gmail users need to be able to communicate with non-Gmail users, and vice versa. Email is far less “boxed” than the aforementioned proprietary XMPP platforms. As a result, Google hasn’t been able to control the email platform as easily; Google can’t simply migrate Gmail users to a non-email platform that’s incompatible with the rest of the email landscape to further domesticate its users.</p>
<p>XMPP is still alive and well, but its current popularity is a fraction of what it once was.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-clout">Implementation clout</h3>
<p>Standards are a form of agreements made to ensure compatibility between implementations. Such agreements need to be agreed upon by the implementations themselves. When one implementation grows dominant, so too does its leverage in the decision-making process over shared standards. Too much dominance can create a monoculture in which the dominant implementation is the only implementation that conforms to the spec.</p>
<p>With enough leverage, a dominant implementation can serve as a reference implementation. Reference implementations are typically quite helpful, serving as a source of truth to test other implementations against. Problems may arise when development of the spec and production-grade reference implementation grow tightly coupled, leaving third-party implementation feasibility out of the decision-making process.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-matrix-and-element">Case study: Matrix and Element</h4>
<p>One example of this phenomenon is <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>. Matrix is an open and federated instant-messaging platform similar to XMPP, with a very large spec boasting many features: server-side history, replies, rich text, reactions, room versions, <abbr title="end-to-end encryption">E2EE</abbr>, avatars, display names, typing indicators, read receipts, device verification…the list goes on and grows every month.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The only client that implements all the necessary features is Element. In addition to being the most popular client, Element practically serves as the reference client implementation: it’s developed by the same company that builds the dominant servers and most of the spec. The tight coupling between Element and the Matrix spec allow it to add features at a rate too fast for other clients too keep up; pretty much every Matrix user has to open up Element at some point to perform an action that isn’t supported in any other client. On the server side, Synapse is the only server that implements enough of the spec to be usable, with Dendrite coming in second. Both are made by the same company that develops Element.</p>
<p>Since there aren’t any third-party clients and servers that can replace the official ones, one vendor is close to controlling all parts of the platform. The growing complexity required of clients and servers can also further entrench these dominant implementations, as I <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html#simplicity">previously explained</a>. Matrix is close to being a boxed platform because the official client and server can iterate independently of the greater ecosystem.</p>
<p>I don’t think that Matrix is going to become a fully closed platform anytime soon; the blog post <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">“On Privacy versus Freedom”</a> seems to put it on the right side of the closed/open spectrum. Clients like <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> and <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a> seem to keep up with Element well enough to serve as partial replacements. I do, however, find its current state problematic and much closer to “closed” on the closed/open spectrum than XMPP, IRC, and email.</p>
<h3 id="unstandardized-feature-creep">Unstandardized feature creep</h3>
<p>Platforms are more than their protocols. Different implementations have unique behavior to distinguish themselves. Problems arise when dominant implementations' unique unstandardized features grow past a certain point to make a closed superset of an open platform.</p>
<h4 id="case-studies-email-providers">Case studies: email providers</h4>
<p>After reading my previous article, a few people contacted me to ask for my thoughts regarding certain email providers. There’s not much that can set a standard email provider apart if it just hosts a simple email server. To distinguish themselves, email providers often implement many features beyond email standards compliance.</p>
<p>The vast majority of email accounts come from a small handful of dominant providers backed by large companies (Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Yandex Mail, Mail.ru, iCloud, and others). Providers such as Gmail are notorious for implementing advanced spam filters prejudiced against non-mainstream email providers. Users who self-host email servers or use small providers frequently trigger false positives and end up having their messages incorrectly labeled as spam until they can build up a “reputation”.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The addition of such a complex spam-prevention filter strengthens the email oligopoly by creating a barrier to entry for newcomers. Low-volume senders are discriminated against, as Migadu <a href="https://archive.is/rJnSs#deliverability">found out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve already seen our share of bad spam filters and misconfigured servers. In some cases recipient servers intentionally rejected correct emails just because we are a low volume sender. Ironically that is how an ideal sender should be. To improve the “receiveability” they of course offer their own hosted email service at a hefty price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example: email providers such as Hey.com, Protonmail, and Tutanota offer many features that are incompatible with IMAP/POP3. Protonmail and Tutanota use their own non-standard E2EE implementation (rather than focusing on improving the UX for vanilla PGP), and Hey.com offers server-side mail organization. Users of these services must use official Web, desktop, and mobile clients.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> These three providers control both the client and the server, giving them the means for vendor lock-in. Of course, there’s a limit to the amount of lock-in these providers can achieve: as I explained in the <a href="#case-study-the-boxing-of-xmpp">XMPP case study</a>, these providers still need to support SMTP to stay compatible with the wider email landscape.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>That’s enough doom-and-gloom. Let’s focus on actions that users and vendors can take to keep platforms open.</p>
<h3 id="what-users-can-do">What users can do</h3>
<p>As a user, consider using clients and servers made by different groups of people to make platform boxing more difficult. Pick implementations that suffer from less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature creep</a> beyond spec compliance. What distinguishes a client shouldn’t be <em>what</em> features it has, but <em>how</em> it implements its features. Obviously, having some unique features is great; problems arise when the number of unique features crosses a certain threshold. Following both …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>I’ve gone through <a href="http://coinlib.io/" data-type="URL" data-id="coinlib.io">coinlib.io</a>‘s data regarding crypto’s money flows. Meaning, the trading volume between many pairs on may exchanges.</p>



<p>In this case, i’ve gone out of my way to highlight Dollar flows. Specifically, Dollar flows into and out of Tether and other stablecoin, notably BUSD and USDC – supposedly audited.</p>



<p>Tracking the trading between crypto and fiat, this turns out to be patently false. If there <em>was</em> organic trading between dollars and stablecoin, there ought to be alot of outflows, considering Tether is the gateway to pretty much every crypto at this point. With a $928 billion marketcap across the crypto space, there should be atleast billions of flow in dollars, especially with a circulationg supply of 24,7+ Billion USDT.</p>



<p>We find that there is almost none. The entire trading volume between USD and USDT is no more then $20 million. EVERYTHING ELSE is Tether, perceived to have the same value as a dollar.</p>



<p>This includes all other stablecoins. The same applies: If there was organic trading, there ought to be <em>Dollar</em> inflows. But that isn’t the case: Even in the supposedly audited USDC’s case, the Majority of inflows into the currency are Tethers.</p>



<p>I made this collage as an answer to a question i have had myself for a long time:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="445" height="501" src="https://www.desogames.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tetherunbackedclean.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.desogames.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tetherunbackedclean.png 445w, https://www.desogames.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tetherunbackedclean-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px"></figure>



<p>So far we’ve all been focusing on the change that involves the loan to Bitfinex. But… My question has been for a long time:</p>



<p><em>“What do they mean by Cash “Equivalents”?</em></p>



<p>I mean. Wording means alot. “Which include <span>traditional</span> currency <strong><em><span>AND</span></em></strong> cash equivalents”.</p>



<p>Why not “Which includes cash, cash equivalents and, from time to time….”?</p>



<p><em>Could it be that they count OTHER stablecoin as “Cash Equivalents”?</em></p>



<p>This gave me the thought that Tether might’ve been backed by Tether – but i don’t think they’ve gone that far. Instead, i think it’s a conspiracy. Not a theory, a legitimate conspiracy. Cartels in business exist too, just check the EU’s anti-trust fine history if you want to find them, in all locales.</p>



<p>Coinbase is the entrypoint. Because they only deal in dollars, they deal in <em>trust</em>. Their stablecoin is audited by a supposed reputable Top 5 acocunting agency (Google “Granton &amp; Thornton scandals”). Because people trust coinbase, they’ll put their money into bitcoin on coinbase.</p>



<p>Their latest transparency report still hasn’t been posted as of the 23rd of January, while all other reports are signed between the 12th and 16th, with 17th and 18th days being outlyers – except for November 23rd 2020 for the October report: <a href="https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency">https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency</a></p>



<p>Their last report from November says: “US Dollars held in custody accounts = $3,004,921,958” – and i find it notable this is pretty close to the reserves Tether claimed to have audited a few years ago. Also those where the USDC reserves as of November 30th. Their October 31st holdings: $2,973,954,847.</p>



<p>I wonder why their report of December is late?</p>

<p>Oh wait no i don’t. They don’t have that much. All those inflows are Tether:</p>

It’s quite large due to the amount of data contained. Unavoidable i’m afraid, because separation of data, and people unable to connect it in their head, is the reason this has been able to go on for so long. Complexity offers secrecy. So an overview in one picture that tracks and highlights USD flows (into Tether mainly) offers clarity.</figcaption></figure>



<p>BUSD same thing. HUSD same thing. </p>



<p><em>THEY’RE ALL IN ON IT!</em></p>



<p>Coinbase is the entry gate. Kraken is the side-door to make sure people can still “travel” in and out of the crypto space; The main objective is to keep the majority of the people inside of the Hotel California. Only when they go for the exits in large enough numbers does the scam collapse.</p>



<p>Huobi handles the Asian market. Binance increases demand for Tether and other stablecoin by offering *insane* gains…. Which always materialize because Bitfinex can just print Tethers and hand them over to Binance. There have been many Whale Alerts on Twitter that show as much.</p>



<p>The final piece of evidence for this is the fact that Coinlib shows USD flows between Tether and USD: https://coinlib.io/exchange/kraken</p>



<p>But Tether shows NO flows between It and USD: https://coinlib.io/coin/USDT/Tether</p>



<p>Once you’ve eliminated the impossible, whatever’s left, however improbable must be the truth:</p>



<p><em>There is no USD-USDT trading on Kraken going on. There is no link. People trading USDT-USD on Kraken are trading against Kraken’s personal account filled with Tether or USD. Like Bernie Madoff, who never made a single trade in his trading account during the entire scheme; It could very well be that Kraken has never made a single Tether-USD transaction in their entire existence.</em></p>



<p>While i can’t say anything about Bittrex or smaller exchanges… The big ones: Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, Huobi and Coinbase are <strong><em><span>ALL</span></em></strong> guilty of <em>both</em> the largest Ponzi scheme, and the largest Dollar Counterfeiting scheme in history.</p>



<p><span>ALL THEIR OFFICES SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RAIDED, THEIR TRADING CEASED, AND THE MONEY RECOVERED AS BEST IT CAN BEFORE THEY, AND IT, <strong>COMPLETELY </strong>DISAPPEARS!</span><span></span></p>



<p><strong><span>THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH!</span></strong></p>
