November 9, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Almost everything in the web is sent with <strong>http</strong> and even non-developers have seen it when using the internet as keyword
inside urls or links.</p>
<p>Http stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and gives us the ability to transfer hypertext between a browser and a server.
This is a great technology that has been around almost since the invention of the web and is constantly evolving and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">offering more and more great features</a></p>

<p>As a developer you probably heard of http headers, at least in the moment you heard about the CORS policy.
This is a problem you must have heard about when developing websites.
But what exactly are http headers and what other ways are there to use them?</p>
<p>Let us first find out what they do and how you could use them. </p>
<p>When a browser requests a resource, for example a page of this blog, it asks the server with a request.
This request looks something like this: </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://www.lorenzweiss.de/race_conditions_explained/"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  credentials<span>:</span> <span>"include"</span><span>,</span>
  headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    accept<span>:</span>
      <span>"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"accept-language"</span><span>:</span> <span>"en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"cache-control"</span><span>:</span> <span>"max-age=0"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-mode"</span><span>:</span> <span>"navigate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-site"</span><span>:</span> <span>"same-origin"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"?1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"upgrade-insecure-requests"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  referrerPolicy<span>:</span> <span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>,</span>
  body<span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
  method<span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>,</span>
  mode<span>:</span> <span>"cors"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So you can see the URL or location of the resource, some information about the request and also a lot of headers with some information about the request.
This is how your browser tells the server some more information about the request. For example what kind of data type it accepts or
how the client is handling the cache.</p>
<p>After sending the request, the server replies, and it also sets some headers in the reply, which could look like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>:authority: www.lorenzweiss.de
:method: GET
:path: /race_conditions_explained/
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7
cache-control: max-age=0
cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1173972759.1584812492; _gid=GA1.2.2076192721.1594044231
sec-fetch-mode: navigate
sec-fetch-site: same-origin
sec-fetch-user: ?1
upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also some information that the server wants to tell the browser what to do with the resource, for example
if there are cookies, it must be determined which encoding was used, etc</p>
<p>Basically, in the http-context the headers for the communication of the browser and the server are used to extend the simple
Requests for resources. You could see it as the sheet of paper that is added on top of a package that you oder from an online store,
giving you more information about the context and the resource that you ordered.
Most of the headers have quite good defaults which you don't need to think of, but there are some headers that
can get quite important, like CORS headers. But there are so much more headers that you might never heard of which are very useful
and good to know how to use. </p>

<p>Do not worry, this article will not deal with CORS headers. The following http headers are those that are rarely used, but
can be really powerful and helpful to significantly improve the communication between a server and the browser. </p>
<p>So let's dig into it. Here are some headers that you can set and that are very useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="if-range"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Range">If-Range</a><a href="#if-range" aria-label="if range permalink"></a></h2>
<h3>What and why?</h3>
<p>Imagine you start downloading a large resource, such as a video, an image, etc., and stop in between because of connection problems.
With <code>If-Range</code> you can tell the server if the representation is unchanged, to send the part(s) that are requested in Range.
Which means only the parts that were missing and not again the whole thing.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful when dealing with large resources and often bad connections as with mobile devices.
Because the resource can be downloaded in parts even if the connection is interrupted in between. </p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>It can either be used with a date when the resources were last modified, or with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>, which is a key to help if the resources was invalidated</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt; GMT
If-Range: &lt;etag&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="vary"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary">Vary</a><a href="#vary" aria-label="vary permalink"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vary</code> Comes from a time when the web or http was used for a variety of things and not just for web pages.<br>
It is based on the idea of using http to exchange information in many different formats.
How does it do that? Well, it tells the server in which header to find the information, how to present the information. </p>
<p>Nowadays it can be really helpful if you have different resources for different customers, for example
mobile, tablet or desktop.
Imagine three different images for the same resource are stored on the server, depending on the device.
Then you can simply use the <code>Vary</code> header to tell the server to check the device and then decide which image size to send. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>For the example with the device dependent images, you can simply pass the 'user agent' to tell the server
that it should check the user-agent for device information. </p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>Just enter the header, the server must check before deciding which resource to send.</p>
<h2 id="content-disposition"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</a><a href="#content-disposition" aria-label="content disposition permalink"></a></h2>
<p>If we go back to the example of a request to a server, for example to load this website, it is clear to the browser,
that it must <strong>display</strong> the resource of the answer.
But it can also be the case that the server sends a resource that the browser should automatically download to the user's computer,
like a picture or pdf etc.
A server can tell the browser what the browser should do with the attached resource via the <code>Content Disposition</code> header.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>With defining the <code>Content-disposition</code> to <code>attachment</code> the browser knows that this is a resource to download instead of just
show. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="data.pdf"</code></pre></div>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>You can define the header as <code>inline</code> or <code>attachment</code>, where `inline is always the default.  </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: &lt;inline | attachment&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="feature-policy"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">Feature-Policy</a><a href="#feature-policy" aria-label="feature policy permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This is a fairly new header and therefore only supported by modern browsers (sorry to all IE users). However
I want to mention this anyway because I think it can be really helpful for some use cases.<br>
Basically, the <code>feature-policy tells the browser which features or apis the browser should provide to the document and its</code>iframes` to be used. </p>
<p>For example, it can ban all scripts or iframes etc. within this website to allow sensitive apis like the camera or microphone.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;allowlist&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>directive</code> is the name of the feature. You can see the full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#Directives">list of features here</a>
The <code>allowlist</code> defines the origins which are allowed to use the directive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want our website to use neither the microphone nor the camera. With this header the
document or a contained iframe cannot access these functions.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'</code></pre></div>
<h3>More Headers:</h3>
<p>Here are some more headers that are worth mentioning: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests">Upgrade-Insecure-Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age">Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer">Trailer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Https headers are great and also very useful! But sometimes they can be quite complex, and it's really hard to get an overview of what headers are available and what benefits they bring.
Also when developing a website, especially in the frontend, you don't come in contact with them too often, except maybe with the CORS headers.
But I think that this missed some possibilities. http headers represent the communication between the server and the
customers much better, and we all know that communication is the key to a good relationship.</p>
<p>I hope I could shed some light on the darkness of http headers for you. In case I missed a good and helpful header,
please do not hesitate to send me a mail or contact me in any way.</p></div></div>]]>

	  <p>From coastal towns to rural farms to urban centers, climate change poses an existential threat — not just to our environment, but to our health, our communities, our national security, and our economic well-being. It also damages our communities with storms that wreak havoc on our towns and cities and our homes and schools. It puts our national security at risk by leading to regional instability that will require U.S military-supported relief activities and could make areas more vulnerable to terrorist activities.</p>

	   <p>The current COVID-19 pandemic reminds us how profoundly the energy and environmental policy decisions of the past have failed communities — allowing systemic shocks, persistent stressors, and pandemics to disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income communities.</p>
<p>At this moment of profound crisis, we have the opportunity to build a more resilient, sustainable economy — one that will put the United States on an irreversible path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050. Biden is working to seize that opportunity and, in the process, create millions of good-paying jobs that provide workers with the choice to join a union and bargain collectively with their employers.</p>
<p>President-elect Biden is leading the world to address the climate emergency and leading through the power of example. Biden knows how to stand with America’s allies, stand up to adversaries, and level with any world leader about what must be done. He will not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change – he will go much further than that. He is working to lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets.</p>

	   <p>President-elect Biden will ensure that — coming out of this profound public health and economic crisis, and facing the persistent climate crisis — we are never caught flat-footed again. He is working to launch a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future.</p>
<p>The current coronavirus crisis destroyed millions of American jobs, including hundreds of thousands in clean energy. It has exacerbated historic environmental injustices. Biden will immediately invest in engines of sustainable job creation — new industries and re-invigorated regional economies spurred by innovation from our national labs and universities; commercialized into new and better products that can be manufactured and built by American workers; and put together using feedstocks, materials, and parts supplied by small businesses, family farms, and job creators all across our country.</p>
<p>President-elect Biden is working to make far-reaching investments in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Create millions of good, union jobs rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure – from roads and bridges to green spaces and water systems to electricity grids and universal broadband – to lay a new foundation for sustainable growth, compete in the global economy, withstand the impacts of climate change, and improve public health, including access to clean air and clean water.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Industry:</strong> Create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry, domestic auto supply chains, and auto infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations, positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century; and invest in U.S. auto workers to ensure their jobs are good jobs with a choice to join a union.</li>
<li><strong>Transit:</strong> Provide every American city with 100,000 or more residents with high-quality, zero-emissions public transportation options through flexible federal investments with strong labor protections that create good, union jobs and meet the needs of these cities — ranging from light rail networks to improving existing transit and bus lines to installing infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists.</li>
<li><strong>Power Sector:</strong> Move ambitiously to generate clean, American-made electricity to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. This will enable us to meet the existential threat of climate change while creating millions of jobs with a choice to join a union.</li>
<li><strong>Buildings:</strong> Upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes over 4 years, creating at least 1 million good-paying jobs with a choice to join a union; and also spur the building retrofit and efficient-appliance manufacturing supply chain by funding direct cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade and electrify home appliances and install more efficient windows, which will cut residential energy bills.</li>
<li><strong>Housing:</strong> Spur the construction of 1.5 million sustainable homes and housing units.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Drive dramatic cost reductions in critical clean energy technologies, including battery storage, negative emissions technologies, the next generation of building materials, renewable hydrogen, and advanced nuclear – and rapidly commercialize them, ensuring that those new technologies are made in America.</li>
<li><strong>Agriculture and Conservation:</strong> Create jobs in climate-smart agriculture, resilience, and conservation, including 250,000 jobs plugging abandoned oil and natural gas wells and reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines — providing good work with a choice to join or continue membership in a union in hardhit communities, including rural communities, reducing leakage of toxics, and preventing local environmental damage.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Justice:</strong> Ensure that environmental justice is a key consideration in where, how, and with whom we build — creating good, union, middle-class jobs in communities left behind, righting wrongs in communities that bear the brunt of pollution, and lifting up the best ideas from across our great nation — rural, urban, and tribal.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Nanna Bonde Thylstrup, <span>Copenhagen Business School, Denmark;</span>&nbsp;Zeerak&nbsp;Waseem, University of Sheffield, UK;&nbsp;and Daniela Agostinho, University of Copenhagen, Denmark</em></p><p><em>Within the context of academia, much like in other sectors of society, the ongoing pandemic has exposed inequalities that we here describe as 'open secrets'.

Engaging with the 'viral condition' foregrounded by this virtual symposium, this essay thinks through how the virality of digital media is currently intersecting with the unfolding viral pandemic. As we find ourselves connecting in new ways, we suggest that it is time to consider the challenges posed by digital networks, the troubled intimacies they generate, and their potential to forge alliances and solidarities amidst stark and growing inequality.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p><div><p>COVID-19 turned the familiar humdrum of the academic year upside down, abruptly putting a stop to everyday routines and demanding new practices. The effects of COVID-19 have been brutal across society: unemployment rates have skyrocketed, economies have gone to shambles, and hundreds of thousands have died and will continue to die and fall ill from this disease.</p><p>&nbsp;Many writers before us have pointed out how the unfolding pandemic has magnified existing inequalities, laying bare realities that were there all along. Such inequalities have also become highly visible in digitally-enabled academia, as higher education institutions have rushed to respond to the spread of the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;Across privileged Scandinavia, from where we write, professors retreated to spacious summerhouses away from urban centres, quietly enjoying their sudden liberation from academic reproductive labour, tedious meetings and departmental obligations. Some even enjoyed a surge in productivity or used their time to catch up on their reading lists. Others seized the chance to add a COVID-19 grant to their already extensive grant collection. Beyond Scandinavia, journal submissions from male authors went up (Flaherty 2020). Executive branches of academia saw new opportunities in the sudden shift to online teaching, framing the analogue-to-digital conversion as a positive disruptive force (Kandri 2020). Tech companies strongly encouraged this embrace and gained new strongholds in the educational sector, fueling disaster capitalism on campus (Turiano 2020). From this perspective, COVID-19 was not only experienced as a social tragedy, but also as an opportunity for retreat, advancement and profit.</p><p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, with their work rhythms, social lives and study habits upended, students struggle to keep afloat in small and shared accommodations. A massive pre-existing mental health crisis among the student population suddenly hits the headlines (Pedersen 2020). Without a systemic response in place, some universities reacted with quickly improvised tips on how to keep a routine and promises of a mindfulness app (Munk 2020), offering technological fixes in lieux of politically-informed responses. Feminist, anti-racist and critical disability communities quickly came together to perform the unpaid and academically unrecognised labour of gathering best practices for online teaching (Davidson 2020; Hamraie 2020; Wernimont 2020). Yet, as student and teacher frustration with online instruction accumulates over time, the already devalued labour performed by critical digital pedagogy is even more frowned upon than before the pandemic. Moreover, the socio-political critiques that underlie this body of scholarship are evacuated by utilitarian uptakes, disregarding the critique of sexism, racism and ableism in academia in favour of uncritical implementation of digital technologies. Meanwhile, the divide between tenured faculty and short-term employees is widening (Zahneiss 2020). Researchers on temporary contracts witness their working hours and job prospects disappear like grains of sand in a precarious hourglass, while universities avoid committing to contract extensions or even use the opportunity to fire temporary employees (Collini 2020). Fieldwork stalls. And journal submissions by women drop (Wiegand et al. 2020; Andersen et al. 2020).</p><p>&nbsp;Within the context of academia, much like in other sectors of society, the ongoing pandemic has exposed inequalities that we here describe as 'open secrets'. The disclosure of such open secrets, or 'hidden truths' that were never hidden to begin with, is being facilitated through the digitally networked spaces that bring us together more than ever. Engaging with the 'viral condition' foregrounded by this virtual symposium, this essay thinks through how the virality of digital media is currently intersecting with the unfolding viral pandemic. As we find ourselves connecting in new ways, we suggest that it is time to consider the challenges posed by digital networks, the troubled intimacies they generate, and their potential to forge alliances and solidarities amidst stark and growing inequality.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Leaky conditions – ‘hidden’ truths</strong><br>As we practice containment – stuck in rooms, apartments, buildings, cities and countries – we also experience new modes of intimacy. Through the porous digital networks that bind us, we leak into each others’ homes and lives. We screenshot and close-examine colleagues’ bookshelves and domestic backgrounds. We observe meeting participants who, forgetting they are on screen, fill dishwashers, pick noses or go to the restroom. We leak into rooms and backyards of students while our children, partners, parents and pets photobomb our lectures. We even leak into our own field of vision, our tired faces – normally out of sight – staring back at us on screen.</p><p>&nbsp;These new digital intimacies (Wiehn 2020) are not reserved for close friends and colleagues. We also leak into wider communities and data aggregates through video conferencing platforms, contact tracing apps and new higher-ed platforms. Professors conducting online classes about China in one end of the world leak into Chinese censorship apparatuses through Zoom (@letahong 2020). Researchers developing contact tracing apps in the health sector find themselves entangled in regimes of surveillance and policing (Amnesty 2020). And the rushed adoption of digital technologies in the classroom sediments infrastructures that create new value flows between big tech and higher education (Walsh 2020). Academia’s apparently contained spaces, previously upheld by physical walls and normative epistemological boundaries between the public and private spheres, now turn into intimate membranes that leak through digital networks.</p><p>&nbsp;Digital intimacies have given rise to a string of viral stories about digital transgressions: people unwittingly broadcasting their toilet visits and intimate affairs to department meetings and online classes (Vincent 2020; Smith 2020; Feldman 2020). And in turn, the racialised and sexualised abuse that occurs offline now leak into once safe spaces. Rather than merely exposing flawed privacy settings or digital illiteracy, these stories, in which the boundaries between public and private dissolve, tend to confirm the inherently porous nature of digital technologies. The leakiness of digital technologies is not accidental or anecdotal; it is built into the digital networks that bind us. Rather than premised on sealed infrastructures that shield and protect, digital technologies are meant to leak at all times (Agostinho and Thylstrup 2019; Chun 2016). Crucially, this leaky nature not only exposes domestic intimacies to the wider world; it also enables and upholds the economic model of surveillance capitalism, as it allows for massive and continuous data flows across platforms.</p><p>&nbsp;Exhausted by lockdowns and fatigued by digital screens, many of us long to return to more contained spaces: meeting rooms, classrooms, hallways and canteens that will allow us to maintain the (imagined) boundaries between public and private and navigate safe and unsafe spaces physically. But this longing for contained spaces also reveals a conservative nostalgia for spaces where privilege can thrive without being confronted by precarity and vulnerability. A space where the pre-existing inequalities are less dramatically seen and felt. Where academia’s dirty secrets can be thrown back into the closet.</p><p>&nbsp;Here we draw on queer theorist Eve Sedgwick and her landmark book <em>Epistemology of the Closet</em> (1990), where she challenges the binary ‘secrecy/disclosure’ that forms the backbone of modern society. Following Michel Foucault, Sedgwick examines sexuality (its secrecy and disclosure) as the structure of modern ways of knowing. She suggests that modern power is premised on the knowledge and withholding of secrets, or as she puts it, modern power is organized around the figure of the closet. The closet here functions as a contained space: what it contains (what is closeted) and what it spills or leaks (the act of outing) structures the modern organisation of knowledge, what is supposed to be known and what is supposed to remain unknown. As Claire Hemmings puts it, the 'closet is the open secret through which difference and inequality are both obscured and played out in front of our eyes in plain sight' (Hemmings 2020).</p><p>&nbsp;The closet of society’s open secrets has been further challenged by the intersection of the pandemic with digital connectivity. Within academia, the shared (if unequally felt) condition of COVID-19 and the unprecedented intimacy of digital media laid bare the 'hidden' truths of academic inequality, both locally and globally. We use scare quotes around 'hidden' to emphasise how these inequalities were never actually <em>hidden</em>. Instead they were hiding in plain sight, but only the privileged could afford to look away: the unequal distribution of reproductive labour, falling along gendered and racialised lines; the previous exclusion …</p></div></div>

</p>
<p>The majority of us in the present and in the immediate future <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/exactis-data-breach-paving-road-data-dystopia-us-gdpr">will face the issue of Privacy</a>. Consider this basic thought, which may sound like science fiction, but is actually quite present today: Thanks to the devices we wear now, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/exactis-data-breach-paving-road-data-dystopia-us-gdpr">the harvesting of our biometric data</a> is a possibility. It is this thought process that led to this think piece on privacy and big data.</p>
<p>Corporations can get to know us far better than we know ourselves. They can then not just predict our feelings but also manipulate our feelings. Monitoring of our biometrics can make episodes like that of Cambridge Analytica’s data hacks prehistoric in comparison. </p>
<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/heres-much-google-facebook-really-think-youre-worth.html/">you are worth quite a bit of money to the social channels </a>you use. The podcast detailing the <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9IY09mTE41Mg&amp;ep=14&amp;episode=MjM0YjM1OTgtZTQ1Mi00NGZhLTkzYjUtMTQxMGJjZTY1NGE4">Congressional Antitrust Investigation on Tech Monopolies: Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple</a> gives a serious look at how powerful these big data companies are. The scale is astronomical. Amazon captures 70% of all retails in the United States. They literally have seven times the revenue of their next largest competitor. </p>
<p>Now imagine their cloud computing capabilities. Take stock of the number of iPhones that are there. We know that what you share on social media, and the information that you surrender is a Big Data Issue; and, consider the number of search results Google controls. There’s information about you being harvested. You should know how your information is being used. </p>
<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>We hear of how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/steve-bannon-on-cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-is-for-sale-all-over-the-world">Steve Bannon used Facebook</a> to change politics and change culture. Facebook data, algorithms and narratives were his key weapons. These tools were used by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambridge-analytica-kogan-idUSKBN1GX2F6">Cambridge Analytica team to identify the dark triad</a> — Narcissism, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy — in people. We now know about the Russian interference in American politics. We know how data had been manipulated to channel the latent proclivities of racism and anti-Semitism within America to divide it. </p>
<p>The same podcast makes mention of a great knowledge-infused book, which is Shoshana Zuboff’s <a href="https://youtu.be/QL4bz3QXWEo">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>. In this book, Zuboff details the rise of a new form of power which will forever change our lives. By collecting behavioral data from their users, corporations have amassed an incomprehensibly large and detailed picture of our personal lives. They use this data to expand their corporate power and profitability. This, of course, has tremendous consequences for our privacy, but also for our political system.</p>

This is based on the predictive signals based on the punctuation we use on a Facebook status. </figcaption></figure>
<p>Surveillance Capitalism is where it universally claims our private human experience as their free source of raw material. They take the rich predictive signals in our behavior and convert it into data. We hear of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/#:~:text=Leaked%202017%20document%20reveals%20FB,exploit%20teens'%20words%2C%20images.&amp;text=Facebook's%20secretive%20advertising%20practices%20became,of%20the%20company's%20Australian%20office.">Facebook executives who promote&nbsp;advertising campaigns that exploit Facebook users’ emotional states</a>. Facebook’s algorithms can determine, and&nbsp;allow&nbsp;advertisers to pinpoint, “moments when young people need a confidence boost.”&nbsp;97% of Facebook’s revenue comes from its online targeted advertising markets. These are wholly-owned and operated in this surveillance capitalist economic logic. </p>
<p>Readers of Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction will be compelled to believe the potential dangers of big data. O’Neil, a mathematician, analyses how the use of big data and algorithms in a variety of fields. These include insurance, advertising, education, and policing. They can lead to decisions that harm the poor, reinforce racism, and amplify inequality. Mathematicians and statisticians were for a very long time studying our desires, movements, and spending power. This is the Big Data economy we are living in. </p>
<h2>Trust is Important </h2>
<p>Consumers are more conscious of their data privacy than ever. A recent <a href="https://tealium.com/resource/whitepaper/how-brands-can-prioritize-privacy-in-the-age-of-data/">Tealium study</a> on consumer data privacy found that 97% of consumers surveyed said they are somewhat or very concerned about protecting their data. <a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20171220T024439Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-68/Accenture-Global-Anthem-POV.pdf#zoom=50">Research by Accenture</a>&nbsp;shows that&nbsp;88% of<strong> </strong>consumers say companies that provide personalized experiences without compromising their trust are more appealing and can relate to their needs better than others.</p>
<p>We are focusing on Facebook on this particular blog post to quite a degree since it is the one singular social medium that is growing exponentially. One of the ways in which Facebook garners your data is with you revealing your data and your intentions via the act of publishing status updates and even commenting. You see, the act of commenting fulfills just one touchpoint in the process of these tech giants harvesting of data. Facebook built&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/" target="_blank">comments plugin</a>&nbsp;to allow users to leave comments on websites, blogs and forums through their Facebook accounts. It was expected to provide high-quality conversations over the internet but instead ended up spamming popular sites.</p>
<p>If you do use the Facebook Comments plugin, remember that your comments are a valuable content asset that shouldn’t be subject to <a href="https://ducttapemarketing.com/how-and-why-i-use-the-facebook-comments-plugin/">Facebook’s Terms of Service</a>, which basically says they can do whatever they want with them. An increasing amount of spam raises questions about how well the policy of malicious content online is going on. There are many misleading and offensive comments, usually attracting and persuading users towards a specific link to click it. These comments are often repetitive and can easily be identified as spam.</p>
<p>According to an estimation by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.similartech.com/technologies/facebook-comments">Similartech</a>&nbsp;more than 360,000 unique domains have installed Facebook Comments plugin. It is still not clear why and how the spam filters of Facebook failed to filter spam comments. <a href="https://www.similartech.com/technologies/facebook-comments">In 2015</a>, one of the security firms, Symantec reported scammers had been trying to affect the comments sections of Facebook to spread malware. </p>
<p>For more than two years now, Facebook has been working on its content-moderation efforts and the spamming in Facebook Comment boxes shows that problematic content still finds its way to escape the loopholes. Moreover, <a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html">Facebook can track what </a><a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html">you</a><a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html"> type</a>, even if you never post it.&nbsp;Data scientists can determine that a status or comment has been typed by tracking code in the HTML form element of each page.</p>
<h2>Read The Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>We live in a world where the concept of privacy already seems outdated. But that is largely because we’ve decided not to inquire about what happens when we trade it for convenience. The more connected you, and billions of others, are to Facebook, the more money Facebook makes by selling your personal information, and the more powerful it becomes.</p>
<p>The terms of service state,&nbsp;<em>We use the data we have — for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products — to personalize your experience.</em></p>

<p>Basically, this means that Facebook uses every bit of personal information it can, collected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/how-facebook-tracks-you-even-when-youre-not-on-facebook/">both on and off Facebook</a>, to entice advertisers. The better the company knows you through the personal information you share with your friends and family, the more likely they are to be able to sell you stuff you want.</p>
<h2>Choose The Right to Privacy</h2>
<p>Big data is big business and value is created from customer insight. But, where is the moral line? What happens when companies cross that line? What if consumers could flip the equation to offer their data directly to the companies they trust? The future could be customer-monetized data.</p>
<p>We are the authors of our own destruction here since we don’t choose to be aware. If you participate in Facebook, should you not have some semblance of an expectation of privacy. The former Federal Trade Commission Chairperson Jon Leibowitz publicly stated, “We all agree that consumers don’t read privacy policies.”</p>
<p><a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/docs/gdpr">Ensure you choose privacy</a> and are aware of how technology plans on using your data. The only solution is being non-participatory. The solution is choosing not to be part of a pernicious agenda that can be defined as Surveillance Capitalism. </p>

<p>Saturday, November 7, 2020</p>
<p>After fixing the performance and scalability problems, we’re on our way to getting a stable Pijul. In this post, I explain what I’ve been up to in the recent months.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Pijul has always been advertised as a research project, trying to implement a theory of patches that would be sound and fast. This is an ambitious goal, and became even more ambitious than initially envisioned.</p>
<p>One of the hardest challenges is that source code is by essence stateful, which makes it much harder to iterate over algorithm designs, like normal research projecst need to. For example, in order to get from our last published version to our current design, we have gone through many different variants, and there wasn’t much to publish.</p>
<p>Moreover, the UX aspect is what matters most in the end, and testing it on a real world project is the only way to get it there. However, unlike in a compiler, where bootstrapping is done one step at a time, and previous versions are always available to compile your current one, a version control system has the additional problem that the previous versions might not always be easily accessible if there is a bug.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms I’ve heard since I realised that better datastructures were possible is that I was “working secretely”. I certainly understand this feeling, but this is based on a misunderstanding of how research works. When I first had the idea that I’m explaining in this post, I realised that a complete rewrite would be needed. But for a very long time, almost nothing other than unusable, unreadable prototypes happened.</p>
<p>Back then, there wasn’t much to show, since it wasn’t even clear that the basic datastructure would work. And even when they started working at a large enough scale, it took me quite a bit of testing on large repositories before they started actually working.</p>
<p>This also implies that there wasn’t much to show for quite a while, since the new algorithm wasn’t usable until very recently, and any repository started before now would have become obsolete in a matter of days.</p>
<p>There were also <a href="#a-personal-note">persoprofessional reasons</a> for this silence, described at the end of this post.</p>

<p>Pijul depends on two other projects I’ve started.</p>
<h3 id="sanakirja">Sanakirja</h3>
<p>One of these projects is Sanakirja, which is “just” a key-value store, but has the extra feature that databases can be cloned efficiently. I would have loved to just use an existing library, but there just isn’t any that has this cloning feature. However, the scope of Sanakirja is still quite modest, it does one thing and does it well. Obviously, it took some time to find the memory-management bugs, but I have good confidence that this is now done.</p>
<p>In previous releases of Pijul, databases were implemented with a single mmapped file containing the binary representation of B Trees. Despite their lower writing performance (compared to alternatives such as <em>Log-structured merge-trees</em>), and the complexity of the code for deletions, B Trees are very well suited to this use case: indeed, since they are trees, reference-counting the nodes is enough to implement efficient clones.</p>
<p>One of the remaining issues was that in order to grow the database, we needed to un-mmapped the file, grow it, and mmap it again. Since applying a single change in Pijul must be an atomic operation, we needed to cancel the transaction when that happened, and restart it with a bigger file.</p>
<p>Another issue is that I wanted the next libpijul to compile on platforms that don’t have mmap, such as WASM. However, if reallocating an mmapped file has a very low complexity (even though it does have a non-zero cost in terms of system calls), reallocating a chunk of memory often requires copying everything. This completely defeats the point of the algorithms in Pijul, which rely on a particular representation of the datastructures on the disk.</p>
<p>The main innovation in Sanakirja 0.13 is to use a vector of memory blocks (either in memory or mmapped from a file), of exponentially-increasing size. The overhead is just one extra indirection, the complexity of adding items is the same (since the operation of creating an extra block is $O(1)$). The exponentially-increasing sizes mean that the allocated memory is always at least half-full.</p>
<h3 id="thrussh">Thrussh</h3>
<p>The other one is Thrussh. That library implements the SSH protocol, and tries to handle a number of key formats. The former is a surprisingly easy goal, and keeping up with Tokio versions has historically been the hardest bit, while the latter is the most horrendous hydra-like task, with new heads and legacy formats showing up every time you think you’re done.</p>
<h2 id="how-repositories-used-to-work-and-still-do-to-some-extent">How repositories used to work (and still do, to some extent)</h2>
<p>Old-style repositories represented a single file by a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ of lines, where each vertex $v\in V$ represented a line, and an edge from $u \in V$ to $v\in V$, labelled by some change (also called patch) number $c$, could be read as “according to change $c$, line $u$ comes before $v$”.</p>
<p>This means that changes could introduce vertices and lines, as in the following example, where a line $D$ is introduced between $A$ and $B$:</p>
<p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/repos-line-add.svg">
</p>
<p>Here, the thick line represents the change from the file containing the lines $A$, $B$, $C$ to the file with the new line $D$.
An important feature to note is that <strong>vertices are uniquely identified</strong>, by the hash of the change that introduced them, along with a position in that change. This means that two lines with the same content, introduced by different changes, will be different. It also means that a lines keeps its identity, even if the change is applied in a totally different context.</p>
<p>Moreover, this system is append-only, in the sense that <em>deletions</em> are handled by a more sophisticated labelling of the edges. In the example above, if we want to delete line $D$, we just need to make a change mapping the edge introduced by $c_0$ to a deleted edge, which we label by the name $c_1$ of the change that introduces it:</p>
<p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/repos-line-del.svg">
</p>
<p>From now on, we call the full edges <strong>alive</strong>, and the dashed ones <strong>dead</strong>.</p>
<p>We have just described the two basic kinds of actions in Pijul. There are no other. One kind adds vertices to the graph, along with “alive” edges around them, and the other kind maps an existing edge label onto a different one.
In order to fully described the system, I also need to mention that the edge labels are given by two parameters: their status (alive, deleted, and a few others related to multiple files and technical details explained below) and the change that introduced them.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>This scheme allows to defines dependencies between changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a change $c$ adds a vertex, we must have its <em>“context”</em>, i.e. the lines before and after it, hence the changes that introduced these lines are in the dependencies of $c$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a change $c$ deletes a vertex, or in other words maps an existing edge introduced by a change $d$, then $c$ must depend on $d$.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is just the minimal set of dependencies needed to make sense of the text edits. Hooks and scripts may add extra language-dependent dependencies based on semantics.</p>
<h3 id="are-edge-labels-minimal">Are edge labels minimal?</h3>
<p>Our goals is to find the smallest possible system, both for reasons of mathematical aesthetics (why store useless stuff?) and the other one for performance. Therefore, one immediate question comes to mind: why even keep the change number on the edges?</p>
<p>In order to answer that question, suppose we don’t keep the labels, meaning that the maps happen between statuses only. Then, consider the following two situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Change inverses</strong></p>
<p>The first issue happens when two authors delete a line in parallel, and one of the authors reverts their change. Applying these changes yields the following diagram, where the two deletions get merged into one, and the inverse applies to both:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/inverse2.svg">
 </p>
<p>However, this is not what we expect, since one of the authors explicitly reverted the deletion, while the other performed the same deletion in parallel.
By keeping the labels, this is what we get instead:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/inverse3.svg">
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing contexts</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, in the rest of this post, we name two users Alice (with pronouns “she/her”) and Bob (with pronouns “he/his”).</p>
<p>This situation, where Alice writes something in the middle of a paragraph $p$, while Bob deletes $p$ in parallel.
One issue here, is that the situation is not symmetric: when Bob applies Alice’s change, he can tell immediately that something is wrong, because the context of Alice’s edits is labelled as deleted in his repository.</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/known-vertices1.svg">
 </p>
<p>However, Alice’s situation is different: indeed, consider the case where instead of deleting $p$ <em>in parallel</em> of her changes, Bob deleted $p$ after applying Alice’s change. The edges deleted are exactly the same, but this is not a conflict, as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p>The situation is further complicated by the fact that this system doesn’t behave symmetrically with the contexts above and below the new line. Indeed, if Bob deleted the <em>down context</em> of the line (i.e. if he deleted line $C$) instead of the <em>up context</em> (line $B$), Alice could detect the conflict, since in that case, $C$ would have both an alive and a dead edge pointing to it ($C$ is called a “zombie vertex” internally), as shown in the following diagram:</p>

 </p>
<p>Keeping the change identifiers on each edge allows us to solve this. In Pijul 0.12, Bob would add the labels of all the edges around the deleted lines to the dependencies of his change. Then, Alice can tell whether Bob knows of her change before applying it. The changes are conflict if and only if Bob doesn’t know of the new lines.</p>
<p>However, this behaviour was counter-intuitive, <a href="https://discourse.pijul.org/t/why-these-patches-dont-commute/449">as noted by @tae</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every now and then I get questions on how to work with git in a smooth way when developing, bug-fixing or extending curl – or how I do it. After all, I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/26/working-open-source/" data-type="post" data-id="14901">work on open source full time</a> which means I have very frequent interactions with git (and GitHub). Simply put, I work with git all day long. Ordinary days, I issue git commands several hundred times.</p>



<p>I have a very simple approach and way of working with git in curl. This is how it works.</p>



<h2>command line</h2>



<p>I use git almost exclusively from the command line in a terminal. To help me see which branch I’m working in, I have this little bash helper script.</p>



<pre>brname () {
  a=$(<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null</code>)
  if [ -n "$a" ]; then
    echo " [$a]"
  else
    echo ""
  fi
}
PS1="\u@\h:\w\$(brname)$ "</pre>



<p>That gives me a prompt that shows username, host name, the current working directory and the current checked out git branch.</p>



<p>In addition: I use Debian’s <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/bash-completion/-/blob/master/README.md">bash command line completion</a> for git which is also really handy. It allows me to use tab to complete things like git commands and branch names. </p>



<h2>git config</h2>



<p>I of course also have my customized <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file to provide me with some convenient aliases and settings. My most commonly used git aliases are:</p>


<pre title="">st = status --short -uno
ci = commit
ca = commit --amend
caa = commit -a --amend
br = branch
co = checkout
df = diff
lg = log -p --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit
lgg = log --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit --stat
up = pull --rebase
latest = log @^{/RELEASE-NOTES:.synced}..
</pre>


<p>The ‘latest’ one is for listing all changes done to curl since the most recent RELEASE-NOTES “sync”. The others should hopefully be rather self-explanatory.</p>



<p>The config also sets <code>gpgsign = true</code>, enables mailmap and a few other things.</p>



<h2>master is clean and working</h2>



<p>The main curl development is done in the single <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl/curl</a> git repository (primarily hosted on GitHub). We keep the master branch the bleeding edge development tree and we work hard to always keep that working and functional. We do our releases off the master branch when that day comes (every eight weeks) and we provide “<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/snapshots/">daily snapshots</a>” from that branch, put together – yeah – daily.</p>



<p>When merging fixes and features into master, we avoid merge commits and use rebases and fast-forward as much as possible. This makes the branch very easy to browse, understand and work with – as it is 100% linear.</p>



<h2>Work on a fix or feature</h2>



<p>When I start something new, like work on a bug or trying out someone’s patch or similar, I first create a local branch off master and work in that. That is, I don’t work directly in the master branch. Branches are easy and quick to do and there’s no reason to shy away from having loads of them!</p>



<p>I typically name the branch prefixed with my GitHub user name, so that when I push them to the server it is noticeable who is the creator (and I can use the same branch name locally as I do remotely).</p>



<pre>$ git checkout -b bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<p>Once I’ve reached somewhere, I commit to the branch. It can then end up one or more commits before I consider myself “done for now” with what I was set out to do.</p>



<p>I try not to leave the tree with any uncommitted changes – like if I take off for the day or even just leave for food or an extended break. This puts the repository in a state that allows me to easily switch over to another branch  when I get back – should I feel the need to. Plus, it’s better to commit and explain the change <em>before</em> the break rather than having to recall the details again when coming back.</p>



<h2>Never stash</h2>



<p>“git stash” is therefore not a command I ever use. I rather create a new branch and commit the (temporary?) work in there as a potential new line of work.</p>



<h2>Show it off and get reviews</h2>



<p>Yes I am the lead developer of the project but I still maintain the same work flow as everyone else. All changes, except the most minuscule ones, are done as pull requests on GitHub.</p>



<p>When I’m happy with the functionality in my local branch. When the bug seems to be fixed or the feature seems to be doing what it’s supposed to do and the test suite runs fine locally.</p>



<p>I then clean up the commit series with “<code>git rebase -i</code>” (or if it is a single commit I can instead use just “<code>git commit --amend</code>“).</p>



<p>The commit series should be a set of logical changes that are related to this change and not any more than necessary, but kept separate if they are separate. Each commit also gets its own proper commit message. Unrelated changes should be split out into its own separate branch and subsequent separate pull request.</p>



<pre>git push origin bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<h2>Make the push a pull request</h2>



<p>On GitHub, I then make the newly pushed branch into a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pulls">pull request</a> (aka “a PR”). It will then become visible in the list of pull requests on the site for the curl source repository, it will be announced in the #curl IRC channel and everyone who follows the repository on GitHub will be notified accordingly.</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, a pull request kicks of a flood of CI jobs that will build and test the code in numerous different combinations and on several platforms, and the results of those tests will trickle in over the coming hours. When I write this, we have around 90 different CI jobs – per pull request – and something like 8 different code analyzers will scrutinize the change to see if there’s any obvious flaws in there.</p>

Graph snapped on November 5, 2020</figcaption></figure>



<h2>A branch in the actual curl/curl repo</h2>



<p>Most contributors who would work on curl would not do like me and make the branch in the curl repository itself, but would rather do them in their own forked version instead. The difference isn’t that big and I <em>could</em> of course also do it that way.</p>



<h2>After push, switch branch</h2>



<p>As it will take some time to get the full CI results from the PR to come in (generally a few hours), I switch over to the next branch with work on my agenda. On a normal work-day I can easily move over ten different branches, polish them and submit updates in their respective pull-requests.</p>



<p>I can go back to the&nbsp;master branch again with ‘<code>git checkout master</code>‘ and there I can “<code>git pull</code>” to get everything from upstream – like when my fellow developers have pushed stuff in the mean time.</p>



<h2>PR comments or CI alerts</h2>



<p>If a reviewer or a CI job find a mistake in one of my PRs, that becomes visible on GitHub and I get to work to handle it. To either fix the bug or discuss with the reviewer what the better approach might be.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, flaky CI jobs is a part of life so very often there ends up one or two red markers in the list of CI jobs that can be ignored as the test failures in them are there due to problems in the setup and not because of actual mistakes in the PR…</p>



<p>To get back to my branch for that PR again, I “<code>git checkout bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code>“, and fix the issues.</p>



<p>I normally start out by doing follow-up commits that repair the immediate mistake and push them on the branch:</p>



<pre>git push origin <code>bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code></pre>



<p>If the number of fixup commits gets large, or if the follow-up fixes aren’t small, I usually end up doing a squash to reduce the number of commits into a smaller, simpler set, and then force-push them to the branch.</p>



<p>The reason for that is to make the patch series easy to review, read and understand. When a commit series has too many commits that changes the previous commits, it becomes hard to review.</p>



<h2>Ripe to merge?</h2>



<p>When the pull request is ripe for merging (independently of who authored it), I switch over to the master branch again and I merge the pull request’s commits into it. In special cases I cherry-pick specific commits from the branch instead. When all the stuff has been yanked into master properly that should be there, I push the changes to the remote.</p>



<p>Usually, and especially if the pull request wasn’t done by me, I also go over the commit messages and polish them somewhat before I push everything. Commit messages should follow our style and mention not only which PR that it closes but also which issue it fixes and properly give credit to the bug reporter and all the helpers – using the right syntax so that our automatic tools can pick them up correctly!</p>



<p>As already mentioned above, I merge fast-forward or rebased into master. No merge commits.</p>



<h2>Never merge with GitHub!</h2>



<p>There’s a button GitHub that says “rebase and merge” that could theoretically be used for merging pull requests. I <em>never</em> use that (and if I could, I’d disable/hide it). The reasons are simply:</p>



<ol><li>I don’t feel that I have the proper control of the commit message(s)</li><li>I can’t select to squash a subset of the commits, only all or nothing</li><li>I often want to cleanup the author parts too before push, which the UI doesn’t allow</li></ol>



<p>The downside with not using the merge button is that the message in the  PR says “closed by [hash]” instead of “merged in…” which causes confusion to a fair amount of users who don’t realize it means that it actually means the same thing! I consider this is a (long-standing) GitHub UX flaw.</p>



<h2>Post merge</h2>



<p>If the branch has nothing to be kept around more, I delete the local branch again with “<code>git branch -d [name]</code>” and I remove it remotely too since it was completely merged there’s no reason to keep the work version left.</p>



<p>At any given point in time, I have some 20-30 different local branches alive using this approach so things I work on over time all live in their own branches and also submissions from various people that haven’t been merged into master yet exist in branches of various maturity levels. Out of those local branches, the number of concurrent pull requests I have in progress can be somewhere between just a few up to ten, twelve something.</p>



<h2>RELEASE-NOTES</h2>



<p>Not strictly related, but in order to keep interested people informed about what’s happening in the tree, we sync the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES">RELEASE-NOTES</a> file every once in a while. Maybe every 5-7 days or so. It …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>What if it were possible to write software capable of time travel? What if we could write software that was able to retrieve results from a computation solved sometime in the near future? What would this software look like? What problems could be solved?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#Time_loop_logic">Time loop logic</a> is a hypothetical system of computation that exploits the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">Novikov self-consistency principle</a>. In this system the computer is able to send the result of a computation backwards through time and rely upon the self-consistency principle to force the sent result to be correct. This futuristic concept might seem impossible now but I'd imagine trying to explain nuclear fission to a 3rd century blacksmith would seem equally impossible.</p>
<h2 id="writing-time-loop-software">Writing time loop software</h2>
<p>Building on the concept of time loop logic we are able to implement theoretical programming constructs to help better understand the concept of time travel in software. In the following examples we demonstrate what a time loop logic program might look like.</p>
<h3 id="an-event-loop">An event loop</h3>
<p>In the follow examples we'll be using the JavaScript programing language. JavaScript provides a single thread of execution for code to run in. The JavaScript virtual machine is constantly running an event loop. Each tick of this event loop represents a single cycle of code execution. Once this cycle is completed the next tick in the event loop will occur. In the popular <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> framework <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_nexttick_callback">an API is provided</a> to defer the execution of a block of code until the nextTick of the event loop occurs.</p>
<h4 id="node-js-process-nexttick-example">node.js process.nextTick() example</h4>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>'foo'</span>);
}

process.nextTick(foo);
<span>console</span>.log(<span>'bar'</span>);
</code></pre><p>This will output:</p>
<pre><code><span>bar
</span><span>foo</span>
</code></pre><p>The same effect of <code>process.nextTick</code> can also be achieved using JavaScript's setTimeout command</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout<span>(<span>foo</span>, <span>0</span>)</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="node-js-process-prevtick-example">node.js process.prevTick() example</h4>
<p>Now let's imagine that instead of deferring a line of code until the next tick of the event loop we could instead push that code <em>backwards</em> to the <em>previous</em> tick of the event loop.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>'foo'</span>);
}

<span>console</span>.log(<span>'bar'</span>);
process.prevTick(foo);
</code></pre><p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code><span>foo</span>
bar
</code></pre><p>The same effect of <code>process.prevTick</code> can also be achieved using setTimeout with a negative value</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout<span>(<span>foo</span>, <span>-1</span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>Since all we are doing is logging a simple string to the console, this is a contrived example. However; building on the concept of <code>process.prevTick</code> we can begin to implement more complex time loop programs.</p>
<h2 id="brute-force-cracking-with-time-loops">Brute force cracking with time loops</h2>
<p>Let's assume a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute-force search</a> password cracking scenario. Imagine there is a login function which expects a password. We have access to a very large word dictionary in which our cracking software will sequentially attempt logins using every word in the dictionary as a password until a match is found.</p>
<p>Here is the code for our brute-force program</p>
<p><em>Note: It's important to remember that Novikov's self-consistency principle guarantees that the sequence of events generating the paradox in the following code has zero probability.</em></p>


<h2 id="prime-factors-with-time-loops">Prime Factors with time loops</h2>
<p>Using time-loop logic  prime factors can be calculated in polynomial time.</p>


<h2 id="zero-lag-instant-communication">Zero-lag / Instant Communication</h2>
<p>The theoretical application of time-loop logic is endless. Imagine a time-loop based communication protocol. This would mean zero millisecond latency. Imagine gaming, video broadcasting, and file sharing with instantaneous transfer and zero lag. Through exploiting self-consistency we know that data will be sent in the immediate future ( since the data has begun transferring from the source ) and that eventually the transmission will arrive at it's destination. As long as the data will eventually be received, we are able to send the result back from the future into the immediate present, removing the notion of latency or lag.</p>
<h2 id="time-loop-logic-and-novikov-s-self-consistency-principle">Time Loop Logic and Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle</h2>
<p>How is it actually possible to program a time loop? Based on the self-consistency principle and continuing advancements in quantum entanglement these types of mind-bending constructs are not very far away. It's very possible we'll see this type of software actively being developed within the next hundred years.</p>
<p>Time loop logic was first written about by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec">Hans Moravec</a> who is best known for his work in robotics and artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University. You can find Hans' original paper from 1991, "Time Travel and Computing", here: <a href="https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html">https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html</a>. I recommend reading the entire paper.</p>
<p>What we know from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve#General_relativity">general relativity</a> is that at a quantum level backwards time-travel is mathematically possible in certain solutions containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve">closed timelike curves</a>. A closed timelike curve is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line">world-line</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold#Lorentzian_manifold">Lorentzian manifold</a>. </p>
<p>Closed timelike curves ( CTCs ) pose a problem for physicists. The existence of CTCs introduces the notion of time travel being possible. If time travel is possible, we have now introduced the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">time travel paradoxes</a> which can violate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)">causality</a>. Since it's generally accepted that we cannot violate causality in our universe we must be able to explain how closed time-like curves can exist.</p>
<p>In his self-consistency principle Novikov asserts that if an event exists that would give rise to a paradox, or to any "change" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero. In short, it says that it is impossible to create time travel paradoxes. You can find the original paper here: <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3737">http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3737</a>. I recommend starting with reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#History_of_the_principle">history of the principle</a>.</p>

<p>In order for time loop logic to return an answer instantaneously, we <em>must</em> ensure that the problem will run long enough into the future to <em>actually</em> calculate the result. If a problem takes sixty seconds to solve, the program must run for at least sixty seconds. Time-loop logic does <em>not</em> violate causality. We are able to retrieve the answer instantly because we have committed to spending sixty seconds in the future calculating the answer and sending it back.</p>
<p>This turns debugging time-loop logic into somewhat of an impossibility. Any bugs in a time loop indicate that sometime in the future a problem has occurred. <strong>This event may or may not be related to software.</strong> </p>
<p>Imagine a computer that utilized a time loop to brute force crack passwords ( as our code posted above did). I turn the machine on and request it cracks the password. The program doesn't work. Frustrated, I turn off the machine and complain to my co-worker Josh.</p>
<p>Josh turns on the machine and requests the password. The software works instantly cracking the password in under 1ms.</p>
<p>Bewildered, I ask Josh why the machine worked for him but not for me.</p>
<p>Josh replies, "It's actually quite simple. Using that computer it's going to take approximately 400 hours to brute force the password. After that 400 hours the CPU must recursively return the cracked password back in time until it reaches right now. I was able to get the answer instantly because I have decided to not turn this computer off for another 399 hours and 59 minutes. Simply put, you turned off the computer too quickly"</p>
<p><em>The consequences of unplugging the computer</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In recent years there's been a steady growth in privacy focused companies. Some examples that have reached large-scale adoption are <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>, <a href="https://signal.com/">Signal</a>, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. These are companies that have put privacy front and center to their value proposition and can be considered <em>privacy-preserving products</em>.</p><p>What these services have in common is that they promise their users a higher degree of privacy relative to their competitors. Instead of the usual encryption in transit (protection from eavesdroppers) and encryption at rest (protection against unauthorized users), services like Signal and ProtonMail enable their users to hide data from anyone except the intended recipient, which — crucially — includes the service providers themselves.</p><p>This category of encryption is known as end-to-end encryption (e2e) and has been vital for anyone whose safety depends on the privacy of their communication (e.g. human rights activists and journalists).</p><p>The canonical implementation of e2e for email is known as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and its reference implementation is GPG. GPG never reached mass adoption and there seems to be a myriad of reasons for that. The most overarching reason, however, seems to be that it continues to be difficult to use. As the founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike <a href="https://moxie.org/2015/02/24/gpg-and-me.html">explains</a>, the spirit behind GPG had been the following:</p><blockquote><p>Instead of developing opinionated software with a simple interface, GPG was written to be as powerful and flexible as possible.</p></blockquote><p>Powerful, flexible software written by nerds, unfortunately also tends to be prohibitively complex for normal users. Combined with the fact that <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">decentralized technology seems unable to quickly adapt to change</a>, the result has been a clunky solution that has, quite frankly, stayed clunky. With no feasible privacy-preserving alternative <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->, non-privacy preserving email providers became the norm.</p><p>One such email provider, Gmail by Google, started off by scanning your emails to serve you personalized ads. Although they've stopped personalizing ads based on your emails, they're using email content to serve you a better experience across their services. Similarly, Facebook tracks what you do so as to shape your experience and keep you glued to their platform.</p><p>What unites these platforms, is described by Professor Shoshana Zuboff as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>”. The business model of surveillance capitalist companies is to harvest personal data about you to build a model that predicts your behavior. These prediction models are packaged and sold as advertisement opportunities to companies eager to buy your attention. The incentive of surveillance capitalists is to harvest your data so they can keep you on the platform and get you to interact with ads. You might be the user, but you're not the customer.</p><p>It should come as no surprise then, that none of these platforms has shipped with end-to-end encryption by default. Doing so would go against the incentives that undergird their very business model. Their ability to predict your behavior, and sell ads based on those predictions, hinges on their ability to harvest your data.</p><p>Selling your data as a predictive model is not the only incentive that exists for collecting your data. Usage data also helps inform product improvements. These improvements typically make the experience even more compelling <!-- -->[2]<!-- -->.</p><p>A company like Google has other business models of course. Google Workspace, aimed at businesses, is a collection of collaboration and productivity tools. This ranges from Google Docs, to chat, to video conferencing, and more. By making this a paid service, Google introduces a different incentive for itself. The customer and the user are now one and the same.</p><p>Even in the case of the user being the customer, user data is still being harvested. This data might not feed into personalized ads (because that’s no longer the primary business model) but it might feed into making the experience better. But what does “better” mean in the business environment?</p><p>Better is often equated with being more productive and in economics productivity is thought of as the ratio between outputs (e.g. GDP for a country, or unit outputs for a business) and its inputs (hours worked). It's a blunt, but useful tool for thinking about how much is produced per hour of work invested.</p><p>We can think about the productivity of a business by considering a company’s profits and its salaries as outputs and the hours worked by its employees as the inputs. Using these quantities we can arrive at a measure that captures a business’ productivity. We would expect both national productivity and business productivity to increase with advances in technology.</p><p>How does technology lead to increases in productivity? One obvious way is by making us more efficient. If some new technology saves us time doing a certain task, all other things being equal, we’ll end up seeing those gains in our outputs (corporate profits and salaries).</p><p>What exactly are the things that increase efficiency for the tasks that we do? In many ways, in the realm of knowledge work, we don't always know before the gains are made. We are still discovering ways in which we can be more productive and especially so in the ways in which collaboration can be improved. A illustrative example of how productivity gains are discovered comes from Kevin A. Kwok's description of Figma's road to success.</p><p>In "Why Figma Wins", <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/">Kwok details</a> how the product team discovered a way to enable more efficient collaboration in the design process. That this was possible wasn't obvious to even those within the scene. While Sketch had broken new ground with their vector based design tool geared towards product designers, Figma took it to another level by taking many of the same (dare I say revolutionary) UX patterns and offering them in a web-native, multiplayer web application.</p><blockquote><p>The core insight of Figma is that design is larger than just designers. Design is all of the conversations between designers and PMs about what to build. It is the mocks and prototypes and the feedback on them. It is the handoff of specs and assets to engineers and how easy it is for them to implement them.</p></blockquote><p>As Kevin explains, Figma brought together the disparate disciplines that are involved in a design process into a synced browser window for everybody. This helped democratize design and remove a lot of friction that had existed before.</p><p>Not only did Figma push the frontier of productivity into new territory, it wasn’t obvious beforehand what that territory would look like. The lesson is that productivity improvements are won through a process of <em>discovery</em>. Kevin explains:</p><blockquote><p>As disciplines evolve, they figure out the social norms needed to operate better, build tools that can be shared across the industry, and invent abstractions that allow offloading more and more of the workload. They learn how to collaborate better, not just with each other but with all the other functions as well.</p></blockquote><p>What <em>is</em> obvious are the relentless improvements that continue to be made in the direction of increased productivity and that the big tech platforms aren’t shying away from investing heavily in innovation (discovery) in that direction.</p><p>One strategy that software companies — especially ones with a lot of resources - are bringing to bear on the challenge of unlocking greater productivity is the harvesting of user data. They  turn the data into insights which informs and enables new features as well as improves existing features.</p><p>The seeking of productivity gains through the harvesting of user data is a path not available to privacy-preserving products. The user data isn't readable to them — and that's the whole point.</p><p>This creates a trade-off from the user's perspective. Whatever your particular motivation might be, as soon as you opt for a privacy-preserving service you're opting for a service that is not able to read your data, and by extension, not able to harvest it. Because the harvesting of data is what is driving many of the improvements in productivity, in choosing to preserve user privacy, these services are forgoing their ability to provide additional gains in productivity.</p><p>Historically, as we saw with the origins of GPG, there has always been additional friction involved in replicating a workflow in a privacy-preserving manner. Although using e2e services such as Signal and ProtonMail has become nearly frictionless, they lack many features their non-privacy preserving counterparts offer.</p><p>If you compare the productivity gains between privacy-preserving and non-preserving products from the perspective of the user, it's hard not to arrive at the conclusion that there’s a gap between the two — and it appears to be growing.</p><p>There is perhaps no better example of a feature which hinges on the ability to read user data than search. Although ProtonMail is reminiscent of Gmail in many ways, one area where it falls short is the absence of any ability to  search the contents of your emails. Search only works if the provider of such functionality can scan and index your content. It works even better if the provider is able to harvest search queries and use those to build predictive models (e.g. autocomplete and smart suggestions). These are features which make Gmail users more productive but aren't available to ProtonMail users <!-- -->[3]<!-- -->.</p><p>The absence of search might not be a dealbreaker for a journalist wanting only to communicate securely with a source. But it is just one example of an ever growing list of productivity improvements that are happening on the side of non-privacy preserving products which cannot be mirrored on the side of the privacy preserving ones.</p><p>Some UX patterns which enable higher degrees of productivity, once discovered by non-privacy preserving products, can be copied relatively easily by their privacy-preserving counterparts. ProtonMail's UX is reminiscent of Gmail, Signal's UX is reminiscent of WhatsApp, DuckDuckGo's UX is reminiscent of Google.</p><p>But there are other features and patterns that, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>TL;DR: <strong>“Structured concurrency” refers to a way to structure async computations so that child operations are guaranteed to complete before their parents, just the way a function is guaranteed to complete before its caller.</strong> This sounds simple and boring, but in C++ it’s anything but. Structured concurrency — most notably, C++20 coroutines — has profound implications for the correctness and the simplicity of async architecture. It brings the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-160">Modern C++ style</a> to our async programs by making async lifetimes correspond to ordinary C++ lexical scopes, eliminating the need for reference counting to manage object lifetime.</p>
<h2>Structured Programming and C++</h2>
<p>Back in the 1950’s, the nascent computing industry discovered structured programming: that high-level programming languages with lexical scopes, control structures, and subroutines resulted in programs that were far easier to read, write, and maintain than programming at the assembly level with test-and-jump instructions and <code>goto</code>. The advance was such a quantum leap that nobody talks about structured programming anymore; it’s just “programming”.</p>
<p>C++, more so than any other language, leverages structured programming to the hilt. The semantics of object lifetime mirror — and are tied to — the strict nesting of scopes; i.e., the <em>structure</em> of your code. Function activations nest, scopes nest, and object lifetimes nest. Objects’ lifetimes end with a scope’s closing curly brace, and objects are destroyed in the reverse order of their construction to preserve the strict nesting.</p>
<p>The Modern C++ programming style is built on this structured foundation. Objects have <em>value semantics</em> — they behave like the ints — and resources are cleaned up in destructors deterministically, which guarantees structurally that resources aren’t used after their lifetimes have ended. This is <em>very</em> important.</p>
<p>When we abandon this strict nesting of scopes and lifetimes — say, when we reference count an object on the heap, or when we use the singleton pattern — we are fighting against the strengths of the language rather than working with them.</p>
<h2>The Trouble With Threads</h2>
<p>Writing correct programs in the presence of concurrency is far more difficult than in single-threaded code. There are lots of reasons for this. One reason is that threads, like singletons and dynamically allocated objects, scoff at your puny nested scopes. Although you can use the Modern C++ style <em>within</em> a thread, when logic and lifetimes are scattered across threads, the hierarchical structure of your program is lost. The tools we use to manage complexity in single-threaded code — in particular, nested lifetimes tied to nested scopes — simply don’t translate to async code.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, let’s look at what happens when we take a simple synchronous function and make it asynchronous.</p>
<pre>void computeResult(State &amp; s);

int doThing() {
  State s;
  computeResult(s);
  return s.result;
}
</pre>
<p><code>doThing()</code> is simple enough. It declares some local state, calls a helper, then returns some result. Now imagine that we want to make both functions async, maybe because they take too long. No problem, let’s use Boost futures, which support continuation chaining:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt; computeResult(State &amp; s);

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  State s;
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [&amp;](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // OOPS
}
</pre>
<p>If you’ve programmed with futures before, you’re probably screaming, <em>“Nooooo!”</em> The <code>.then()</code> on the last line queues up some work to run after <code>computeResult()</code> completes. <code>doThing()</code> then returns the resulting future. The trouble is, when <code>doThing()</code> returns, the lifetime of the <code>State</code> object ends, <em>and the continuation is still referencing it</em>. That is now a dangling reference, and will likely cause a crash.</p>
<p>What has gone wrong? Futures let us compute with results that aren’t available yet, and the Boost flavor lets us chain continuations. But the continuation is a separate function with a separate scope. We often need to share data across those separate scopes. No more tidy nested scopes, no more nested lifetimes. We have to manage the lifetime of the state manually, something like this:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt;
computeResult(shared_ptr&lt;State&gt; s); // addref
                                    // the state

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  auto s = std::make_shared&lt;State&gt;();
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [s](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // addref
                                       // the state
}
</pre>
<p>Since both async operations refer to the state, they both need to share responsibility to keep it alive.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is: <em>what is the lifetime of this asynchronous computation?</em> It starts when <code>doThing()</code> is called, but it doesn’t end until the continuation — the lambda passed to <code>future.then()</code> — returns. <em>There is no lexical scope that corresponds to that lifetime.</em> And that is the source of our woes.</p>
<h2>Unstructured Concurrency</h2>
<p>The story gets more complicated yet when we consider executors. Executors are handles to executions contexts that let you schedule work onto, say, a thread or thread pool. Many codebases have some notion of an executor, and some let you schedule things with a delay or with some other policy. This lets us do cool things, like move a computation from an IO thread pool to a CPU thread pool, or retry an async operation with a delay. Handy, but like <code>goto</code> it is a very low-level control structure that tends to obfuscate rather than clarify.</p>
<p>For instance, I recently came across an algorithm that uses executors and callbacks (called Listeners here) that retries the async allocation of some resource. Below is a greatly abridged version. It is described after the break.</p>
<pre>// This is a continuation that gets invoked when
// the async operation completes:
struct Manager::Listener : ListenerInterface {
  shared_ptr&lt;Manager&gt; manager_;
  executor executor_;
  size_t retriesCount_;

  void onSucceeded() override {
    /* ...yay, allocation succeeded... */
  }
  void onFailed() override {
    // When the allocation fails, post a retry
    // to the executor with a delay
    auto alloc = [manager = manager_]() {
      manager-&gt;allocate();
    };
    // Run "alloc" at some point in the future:
    executor_.execute_after(
      alloc, 10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount_));
  }
};

// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with the above class as a continuation
void Manager::allocate() {
  // Have we already tried too many times?
  if (retriesCount_ &gt; kMaxRetries) {
    /* ...notify any observers that we failed */
    return;
  }

  // Try once more:
  ++retriesCount_;
  allocator_.doAllocate(
    make_shared&lt;Listener&gt;(
      shared_from_this(),
      executor_,
      retriesCount_));
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>allocate()</code> member function first checks to see if the operation has already been retried too many times. If not it calls a helper <code>doAllocate()</code> function, passing in a callback to be notified on either success or failure. On failure, the handler posts deferred work to the executor, which will call <code>allocate()</code> back, thus retrying the allocation with a delay.</p>
<p>This is a heavily stateful and rather circuitous async algorithm. The logic spans many functions and several objects, and the control and data flow is not obvious. Note the intricate ref-counting dance necessary to keep the objects alive. Posting the work to an executor makes it even harder. Executors in this code have no notion of continuations, so errors that happen during task execution have nowhere to go. The <code>allocate()</code> function can’t signal an error by throwing an exception if it wants any part of the program to be able to recover from the error. Error handling must be done manually and out-of-band. Ditto if we wanted to support cancellation.</p>
<p>This is <strong>unstructured concurrency</strong>: we queue up async operations in an <em>ad hoc</em> fashion; we chain dependent work, use continuations or “strand” executors to enforce sequential consistency; and we use strong and weak reference counts to keep data alive until we are certain it’s no longer needed. There is no formal notion of task A being a child of task B, no way to enforce that child tasks complete before their parents, and no one place in the code that we can point to and say, “Here is the algorithm.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you don’t mind the analogy, the hops through the executor are a bit like <code>goto</code> statements that are non-local in both time and space: “Jump to this point in the program, <em>X</em> milliseconds from now, on this particular thread.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That non-local discontinuity makes it hard to reason about correctness and efficiency. Scale unstructured concurrency up to whole programs handling lots of concurrent real-time events, and the incidental complexity of manually handling out-of-band asynchronous control and data flow, controlling concurrent access to shared state, and managing object lifetime becomes overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>Recall that in the early days of computing, unstructured programming styles rapidly gave way to structured styles. With the addition of coroutines to C++, we are seeing a similar phase shift happening today to our asynchronous code. If we were to rewrite the above retry algorithm in terms of coroutines (using Lewis Baker’s popular <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro">cppcoro</a> library), it might look something like this:</p>
<pre>// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with retry:
cppcoro::task&lt;&gt; Manager::allocate() {
  // Retry the allocation up to kMaxRetries
  // times:
  for (int retriesCount = 1;
       retriesCount &lt;= kMaxRetries;
       ++retriesCount) {
    try {
      co_await allocator_.doAllocate();
      co_return; // success!
    } catch (...) {}

    // Oops, it failed. Yield the thread for a
    // bit and then retry:
    co_await scheduler_.schedule_after(
      10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount));
  }

  // Error, too many retries
  throw std::runtime_error(
    "Resource allocation retry count exceeded.");
}
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: This replaces the <code>executor_</code> with a <code>scheduler_</code> that implements cppcoro’s <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro#delayedscheduler-concept">DelayedScheduler</a> concept.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>With the blessing of the Internet, people can learn anything anytime, anywhere without any hassle. Programming Language is one of the examples. Nowadays, not only students but also general people learn programming language as hobbies or to make a career on it as programming could be fun and buy you a Lamborghini at the same time. No kidding, As of Nov 1, 2020, the average annual pay for a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Software-Developer-Salary">Software Developer in the United States is $86,523 a year</a>. Don’t worry, and you don’t need talent, just passion; you can earn too.</p>
<p>However, Choosing a programming language is challenging when you’re getting started. Whenever you search about it, they lead to new recommend blogs, articles, or youtube videos, which could be very confusing. It's not only you; almost everyone faces this common problem. Even I was confused when I started my computer engineering degree.</p>

</ul>
<p>Don’t worry. This article will help you to pick the best language for what you want to learn and become. To learn without any stress, follow the steps below.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-confusion"><strong>No More Confusion</strong>😕</h2>
<p>Every time you search on google or watch videos, you would be like, WTF??!! So, in short, just to let you know,</p>
<p>Python is king!😎</p>
<p>Java is down!😪</p>
<p>C++ is hard!🤐</p>
<p>Javascript is boss!😎</p>
<p>PHP is no more! 😰</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5t9wJjyHAOxvnxcPNk/giphy.gif" alt="confused"></p>
<p>All these languages make you confused?!! Forget what you have read before about this and make your mind and head clear now.</p>

<h2 id="choose-a-development-field"><strong>Choose A Development Field</strong> ⛏️</h2>
<p>Make your mind about which field you want to work with to be less confused. There are many fields such as,</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Mobile App Development</li>
<li>Desktop App Development</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Security (Software / Network)</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more. Just Pick one of them. Let me explain a little bit to understand those fields.</p>
<p>💠 <strong>Web Development</strong> </p>
<p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast, and perform well with a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>💠 <strong>Mobile App Development</strong></p>
<p>Mobile app development is creating software intended to run on mobile devices and optimized to take advantage of those products' unique features and hardware.</p>
<p>💠 <strong>Desktop App Development</strong></p>
<p>Desktop Applications are run stand alone on the user’s laptops and systems. The term used for these applications desktop differs from mobile applications, which are in the trend. The key features of desktop applications are the high efficiency of the application, and these are highly customized as per user requirements and flexibility.</p>
<p>💠 <strong>Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed automatically. Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use them to learn for themselves.</p>
<p>💠 <strong> Software Security</strong></p>
<p>Software security is an idea implemented to protect software against malicious attacks and other hacker risks so that the software continues to function correctly under such potential risks. Security is necessary to provide integrity, authentication, and availability.</p>
<p>💠 <strong> Network Security</strong></p>
<p>Network security is a broad term that covers a multitude of technologies, devices, and processes. In its simplest term, it is a set of rules and configurations designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility of computer networks and data using both software and hardware technologies.</p>

<h2 id="choose-a-programming-language"><strong>Choose A Programming Language</strong>🛠️</h2>
<p>Choose a language based on the platform. Why, if you ask? It will help you to learn faster, and you can become more productive. Now the main problem, There’s a lot of programming languages. Wikipedia has a list of over <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">700 programming languages</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6YglDndxKdCNw7q8/giphy.gif" alt="what"></p>
<p>Wait. WHAT!! 😲</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? How can I choose a programming language over 700 languages?</p>
<p>Hold your horse, man. Don’t worry.</p>
<p>Before that, Check out this gem.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7iR9fH4.jpg" alt="programmic joke"></p>
<p>I will give you a better explanation. Don’t get confused after seeing the list. We don’t need to know about it anyway. I will provide a good summary of programming language that can use for personal work or company work.</p>

<p>For 24 hours I will be blind and alone in my apartment. I eventually want to try being blind for a week, but I’ll need seven days with no other obligations, and I won’t have that for a while. For now, I’ll suffice with a smaller-scale experiments with a few extra provisions for added difficulty.</p>







<ol type="1"><li>I must leave my blindfold on for 24 hours.<ul><li>If I remove the blindfold, I have failed the experiment</li><li>If the blindfold falls off or I can get partial sight, I have failed the experiment.</li><li>I am only allowed to readjust my blindfold if I can see light.</li></ul></li><li>I must not be in contact with any other people for 24 hours.<ul><li>I cannot answer my phone or any other messaging system.</li><li>I cannot receive in-person visitors.</li><li>If someone knocks at the door, I cannot answer verbally or physically.</li></ul></li><li>I will set an alarm for 24 hours. I cannot set any other alarms or use any other means to ascertain the time.<ul><li>It is up to me to keep my phone charged so the alarm goes off.</li></ul></li><li>I cannot leave my apartment.</li></ol>











<p>I have no good reason. I just want to see if I am capable of doing it and what will happen. Some things I’m curious about:</p>



<ul><li>Do I have the willpower to get through the experiment?</li><li>Will I become disoriented from losing all sense of time?</li><li>Will I be able to stave off boredom with podcasts, audiobooks, and music on my phone?</li><li>Will I enter some sort of meditative state due to a lack of sensory input?</li><li><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/scientists-made-people-wear-blindfolds-for-4-days-the-resulting-hallucinations-were-incredible">Will I hallucinate</a>?</li><li>Will my non-sight senses heighten?</li><li>Will I hurt myself by falling or banging into something?</li><li>Will I sleep?</li><li>Will I eat? Is consuming caffeine a good idea (for entertainment) or a bad idea (energy with no direction)?</li><li>Will this experience make me more interested in being blind for a week? Or less?</li></ul>

<p>Attempt One started at 10:30 AM and failed at 1:13 PM. I purposefully took off my blindfold because I was worried that my multiple failures to input my Iphone’s password had resulted in a permanent lock or data wipe. But the password screen was just locked for a minute and all was well.</p>



<p>Given that I failed in the early afternoon, I considered restarting the experiment on another day in the morning. But I had already carved out a 24 hour period when I wouldn’t do any work or be disturbed, and it might have been a week or two longer before I got that opportunity again.</p>



<p>So I checked my messages, briefly went on Reddit, and then restarted.</p>

<p>Attempt Two was successful. I put on my blindfold at 1:23 PM on Thursday, November 5, 2020. I removed it at 1:28 PM on Friday, November 6.</p>



<p>It was an… interesting experience. I don’t recommend it, but I’m glad I did it. I’m not sure where to begin in describing it, especially since I couldn’t take notes, and part of the challenge was being confused. But I’ll do my best to break down the experience.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/3417/products/Les_Sublimes_Cashmere_Scarf_Dark_Blue_packshot_2048x.jpg?v=1539973736" alt="Large Cashmere Scarf in Dark Blue | Les Sublimes" width="427" height="427"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Blindfold</span></strong></h2>



<p>To simulate blindness, I used a dark blue scarf as a blindfold. One layer wasn’t quite dark enough, so I folded it in half for extra light defense.</p>



<p>With the blindfold securely on, my vision was the same whether my eyes were open or closed. I kept my eyes closed 99.9% of the time since it was usually more comfortable and helped limit light. I occasionally opened my eyes to check the brightness level and to… I guess you could call it <em>stretch my eyelids.</em> They don’t feel good if you leave them closed for too long.</p>



<p>I couldn’t get a perfect scarf seal around my eyes, so sometimes when I tilted my head back while sitting I noticed a little light come into the bottom of my vision. To limit this, I often pinched the scarf around my nose in that position. But many/most blind people can see some light anyway, so I don’t think this was a significant violation of the experiment.</p>



<p>My eyes got quite dry under the scarf, so I applied moisturizer to this lids and sockets four or five times. I wanted to use eyedrops too, but there was no way to do so without failing the experiment.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Blindness</span></strong></h2>



<p>Initially, everything was black, but as the day went on and the sun went down, I could tell it was nighttime even through two layers of scarf and my eyelids. I’m not sure if I could tell because my eyes had adjusted to become extremely sensitive to light, or if there were other subtle signals (ie. noises, air temperature, circadian rhythms, etc.) which my body picked up on. As evidence of the latter, I could not see any difference between the tv being on or off, nor the refrigerator being opened or closed, even when I was sitting right in front of either.</p>



<p>What I saw depended on how I applied my focus. If I did focus on my vision, I’d see the typical blackness you get from closing your eyes, but it was never perfectly black nor uniform; there was always some odd movement and occasional coloring (whiteness, pale blue, or sometimes red). The most common distortions were a swirling or flowing whiteness, sort of like cream in coffee. I hoped that being blindfolded for so long would make the distortions more extreme, but for the most part it looked no different than what you’d see if you closed your eyes right now for ten minutes.</p>



<p>There was one exception. It must have been about 20+ hours into the experiment, and my eyes were itching, so I rubbed both of them at the same time over the scarf. If you rub your closed eyes and focus on your sight any time you can see some weird stuff, but this was far more extreme than usual. I remember my entire vision filling up with white bubbles which then broke and briefly returned to black. Then white lightning bolt shapes stretched across my sight, expanded to make my vision purely white, and then slowly faded back to black. The strangest thing about it was the <em>brightness</em>. I literally felt like I was staring into lights despite being blindfolded in a dark room. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 30 seconds, but my heart was racing.</p>



<p>More notable than what I saw was what I didn’t see. By default, I was lost in thought and I focused on nothing. In such a state, I didn’t even register my vision or notice the darkness. I <em>think</em> this made my imagination and mental visualization more acute. On occasion, I’d be deep in thought and I’d get the <em>brightness</em> sensation again because I’d be mentally picturing something so vividly that the inevitable return to darkness felt like shutting off the lights in my brain. I’ll explain more about this in the <strong>Three Phases</strong> section.</p>



<p>Sadly, I did not hallucinate, or at least not as far as I could tell.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Energy</span></strong></h2>



<p>This was the most surprising aspect of the experiment.</p>



<p>I read that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117902&amp;page=1#:~:text=Without%20light%20cues%20that%20the,as%20a%20result%2C%20researchers%20say.">blind people have trouble getting to sleep</a> because they don’t access any/enough light for their circadian rhythms. I seem to have the exact opposite problem. Without light, my body always thinks it’s time to sleep and has trouble doing anything else. Throughout most of the experiment, I felt extremely lethargic, lazy, and had to fight to stay awake.</p>



<p>I started my first failed experiment attempt at 10:30 AM. I had gotten 7.5 solid hours of sleep, I hadn’t done anything tiring the previous day, and I generally felt fine. Then I put on my blindfold, and within thirty minutes I was nodding off. I semi-slept for two hours before deciding to get an energy drink to get myself out of the funk. That worked, but as soon as it wore off, I was back in semi-sleep mode.</p>



<p>Even when I was firmly awake, I generally felt weak and lethargic. Movement around the apartment was annoying of course, but made so much more difficult by my energy levels. I ended up lying perfectly still in my comfy computer chair with my feet on a table 95% of the time. That is, when I wasn’t lying in bed.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when I removed my blindfold after 24 hours, I experienced a <em>burst</em> of energy. Seriously, it was like I had downed a double shot of espresso. It was like a switch had been flicked. The haziness and cobwebs were gone in an instant, and I felt the energy coursing through my body. I guess light has a big impact on me.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Movement</span></strong></h2>



<p>I moved exactly how you’d expect… clumsily.</p>



<p>For the most part, I slowly walked around my apartment with a hand out to feel for walls and edges. Sometimes I’d get lazy and crawl just so it was easier. I know my apartment well enough that it wasn’t hard to get around, but every once in awhile I’d lose track of where I was and would be left slowly swinging my arm around searching for anything. It’s not a pleasant sensation.</p>



<p>Before the experiment, I had planned to pace around for fun, or maybe even do some exercise with the free time. But the confusion and especially the lethargy stopped all that. I just sat in my chair and didn’t move unless I needed to get a drink, go to the bathroom, or sleep.</p>



<p>I kind of wish I had done the experiment in an unfamiliar environment to add to the movement challenge, but oh well.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Necessities</span></strong></h2>



<p>For food, I ate a big lunch at 10 AM before the experiment and then munched on dark chocolate throughout the night. I felt the heavy lethargy well before the lack of calories was an issue. I probably should have put some prepackaged meals in my fridge to eat, but I was worried about making a mess and not being able to clean up. Do I want ants? Because that’s how I get ants.</p>



<p>For drinks, I could manage to get to the kitchen and fill a cup with water when I needed to. I never took a full cup back to my chair just in case I knocked it over (clean up would be a nightmare). I also had some diet coke to serve as entertainment and put a little caffeine in me.</p>



<p>For the bathroom, I (a man) peed sitting down. I’m not ashamed to admit it.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://imgaz2.staticbg.com/thumb/large/oaupload/banggood/images/F2/09/b934b522-e3e3-491d-b758-d0b92c259f0c.jpg" alt="Novel surreal melting distorted wall clock surrealist salvador dali style  wall clock amazing home decoration gift Sale - Banggood.com" width="802" height="801"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Time</span></strong></h2>



<p>As part of the experiment, I never knew what time it was. This was intended to confuse me throughout the 24 hours, and it did, but it may have helped too. With no sense of time, it was easy to sit back and not think about it. Time drifted by and I existed. That was that.</p>



<p>I actually did ask Siri for the time once… it was late in the experiment, and it felt like I had put on the blindfold forever ago. As you’d expect, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <p>A relative of mine called a few months ago: “Hey, I have a grain dryer that I’d like to monitor from my phone. Is that something you could set up in time for harvest season?”</p>

<p>I have no idea how grain dryers work, especially not Internet-enabled grain dryers — because <em>of course</em> that’s a thing — but I figured I’d give it a shot anyway.</p>

<p>For context, a grain dryer is literally a combination of a huge furnace and fans that, you guessed it, dries harvested grain for optimal (lack of) moisture.</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="A GSI grain dryer next to a grain silo." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5a21714733e72c8597435c3ac8150c2fdf955de6/5cfa4/assets/dryer/gsi-1220.jpg">
</p>

</div>

<p>Such dryers typically have an embedded computer running some version of Windows and a touchscreen display that allows monitoring and controlling the dryer’s temperature, timers, and other parameters to get the perfect output.</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="A GSI grain dryer's control panel." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1b66a66084b20383b3d61ebe1da9a9aa038dd8f7/cccbd/assets/dryer/controller.png">

</p>
</div>

<p>However, because these things run for hours at a time, and because agriculture workers during harvest season usually end up in a sleep-deprived state that lasts for multiple weeks, having the ability to monitor these grain dryers remotely lets workers get more precious sleep time (instead of having to walk/drive up to the grain dryer to see if everything’s okay in the middle of the night).</p>

<p>The desired outcome is to monitor the grain dryer remotely using the web interface:</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="An iPhone with the grain dryer's web monitoring interface open in the browser." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2ec442d267d87ac17aa3ace20b6c0a536e74fcc5/89508/assets/dryer/web-ui.jpg">

</p>
</div>

<p>It’s now harvest season 2020, so I connected a grain dryer to the Internet yesterday. It was fun (and weird) and I learned a few things. Here’s how we did it.</p>

<h3 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A GSI grain dryer with a <a href="https://www.grainsystems.com/master/products/conditioning/watchdog-technology.html">Watchdog module</a> installed (I was lucky that the dryer already had this module installed)</li>
  <li>A cellular modem (we purchased a <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/products/mobile-broadband/lte-modems/LB1120.aspx">Netgear LB1120</a>)</li>
  <li>A cellular data plan with a public static IP (we went with Telus, a Canadian cellular carrier, and needed to open a business account to get access to a public static IP for 15$/month per month on top of the base data plan)</li>
  <li>A laptop with an Ethernet port</li>
  <li>A few Ethernet cables</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="topology">Topology</h3>

<p>Here’s how the network topology looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>                   (via public static IP)
                        +----------+
         +--------------&gt; Internet &lt;--------------+
         |              +----------+              |
 +-------v--------+                       +-------v-------+
 | Cellular modem |                       | Mobile device |
 +-------^--------+                       +---------------+
         |
+--------v----------+
|    Grain dryer    |
| (Watchdog module) |
+-------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Essentially, we’ll expose the grain dryer’s web interface to the Internet via a public static IP using a cellular modem. Once it’s exposed, the operator will be able to navigate to that static IP from their mobile device to access the grain dryer’s web interface.</p>

<h3 id="subscribing-for-a-data-plan-and-a-static-ip">Subscribing for a data plan and a static IP</h3>

<p>I called various cellular carriers here in Canada to learn more about their data-only plans and the possibility of adding a public static IP option to the plan: the only carrier that seemed like they knew what they were talking about was Telus. Others either didn’t offer the public static IP option, or didn’t know what I was talking about.</p>

<p>With that, we went ahead and signed up for a business account at Telus (required to get access to the public static IP option), bought a SIM card, and a data-only plan for the modem.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-cellular-modem">Setting up the cellular modem</h3>

<p>First up, we need to make sure we’re able to connect to the nearest cellular tower to connect to the Internet. The Netgear LB1120 is fairly easy to set up on paper: pop a SIM card in there and we’re done, right? Well, for our use case, not quite. There are a few things to do to set it up to use the static IP assigned to the data plan from the cellular carrier. More importantly, the modem needs to be set up in “bridge” mode (instead of “router” mode) to act as a simple bridge (rather than a router) to connect it directly to the grain dryer.</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="Laptop, modem, cables, and various manuals spread out on concrete." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d011a2ceee600cafd7f0ee676b393623f84bbef4/f13bd/assets/dryer/setup-modem.jpg">
</p>
<p>
  On-premise setup to configure the modem and the dryer. That's my trusty ThinkPad X220.
</p>
</div>

<p>Days before arriving on the premises, <a href="https://community.netgear.com/t5/Mobile-Routers-Hotspots-Modems/LB1120-Bridge-Mode-No-Connectivity/m-p/1404666#M3431">I read online that the firmware that ships out of the box is broken</a>: “bridge” mode doesn’t function at all, and an update is required to fix it. This made me a bit nervous because I didn’t have the modem with me, and wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to get the update to work properly. Thankfully, upon inserting the SIM card, turning the modem on, plugging it into the computer via an Ethernet cable, and accessing the modem’s setup interface at <code>http://192.168.5.1</code>, the modem’s web UI suggests downloading the latest firmware over the air. Neat!</p>

<p>From what I read, you must use a firmware more recent than <code>NTG9X07C_12.09.05.27</code> to make sure “bridge” mode works fine. In our case, we updated to <code>NTG9X07C_12.09.05.30</code>, so we’re good.</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="Updating the modem's firmware over the air." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7d6dd2d298b3cf861f6144dc01dc774b85ac9ff3/a036b/assets/dryer/firmware-update.jpg">
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Once the update completes and the modem reboots, we can go in the settings and change the operation mode to “bridge”:</p>

<div>

</p>
</div>

<p>Doing so “turns off the router function of the device and assigns the network IP address directly to the attached host”, which is exactly what we need to connect the modem directly to the dryer’s Watchdog module. Save and let the modem reboot.</p>

<p>Now, the SIM is in the modem, which has the latest firmware and is in “bridge” mode, but there’s one last thing to fix: the cellular carrier is assigning a dynamic IP to the modem, which isn’t what we want: we should be getting the static IP for the data plan we’re paying for. To resolve this issue, we need to tweak the modem’s access point name (APN).</p>

<p>I got stuck on this issue for around 30 minutes before remembering that APNs are a thing and that I could possibly tweak it in the modem settings. I’m glad I remembered!</p>

<p>By default, the modem auto-detects the APN from the cellular carrier. For most cases, this works fine, but in this particular case, we want to use a different APN that allows us to use the static IP assigned to our data plan. APN settings vary by cellular carrier, and I ended up searching for Telus’ APN settings while on premise. I found <a href="https://usatcorp.com/faqs/common-access-point-names-apn-carrier/">USAT Corp’s website to include various APN settings</a>, so I highly recommend trying those values out for your particular cellular carrier.</p>

<p>In our specific case, we needed to use the following settings to be able to get the static IP assigned to the modem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access point name (APN): <code>staticipeast.telus.com</code> (we’re on the east coast)</li>
  <li>Authentication: None</li>
  <li>Packet data profile (PDP): IPv4</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p><img alt="Configuring the APN to use the static IP assigned to the account." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a9161e0b08165d260829bf6fd22337043b63bffa/40217/assets/dryer/apn-settings.png">
</p>
<p>
  In the modem settings, we need to configure a new APN to ask the cellular carrier to assign the account's static IP to the modem.
</p>
</div>

<p>The LB1120 has a setting to automatically connect to the Internet upon booting: I recommend turning this on to have it connect automatically in the case of a power failure.</p>

<p>Let’s reboot the modem one more time. At this point, the modem should be using the static IP assigned to your data plan by the cellular carrier.</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="Signal is equivalent to 2 bars out of 5." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5c248b8917f0fe46445757c0dee3636422b25f1b/b2044/assets/dryer/2-bars.jpg">
</p>
<p>
  The Netgear LB1120 cellular modem, all set up and ready to go. Even though it sits at 2 bars out of 5, it's plenty for the low throughput use case of reading data from a dryer.
</p>
</div>

<p>A tip to know if the modem is configured correctly: with the computer (device A) connected to the modem via Ethernet, use another device (device B) to access the expected static IP address (I used my smartphone). On device A, serve something (anything) on port 80 (I did <code>sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80</code>), and see if you get that on device B when visiting the static IP address. If you do, then the modem is all set up and ready to go. If not, something’s wrong (invalid APN, incorrect data plan, no public static IP configured by the cellular carrier, some sort of NAT that prevents direct access, etc.).</p>

<p>Now that the modem is configured properly, let’s move on to configuring the grain dryer itself.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-the-dryer">Configuring the dryer</h3>

<p>The process to configure the dryer is fairly similar to configuring the modem: we essentially connect the dryer to the laptop via Ethernet to configure it via a web interface. But first, let’s look inside the dryer’s computer compartment.</p>

<p>It all peels up like an onion: the outermost layer is the protective door to prevent water and debris from hitting switches and the touchscreen, and the middle layer is the computer and touchscreen itself along with a PLC. The Watchdog module is fixed inside the box itself.</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="The dryer's computer and PLC internals exposed." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a74f45dc1610d35fecb4981dae16685049b56b5c/11a3d/assets/dryer/onion.jpg">
</p>
<p>
  The dryer's PLC. The Watchdog module is not pictured (it's fixed on the right).
</p>
</div>

<p>When looking inside the box, the Watchdog module is fixed inside and connected to the rest of the PLC via an RS232 serial port. There are two Ethernet ports: one WAN port (the one on the left in the picture), and a LAN port (the one on the right).</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="The Watchdog module fixed inside the computer compartment of the dryer." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e3234c6b71810bcce6c0ab3b7e561fee69d4a57e/1e608/assets/dryer/watchdog-module.jpg">
</p>
<p>
  The Watchdog module. The WAN port is directly connected to the modem.
</p>
</div>

<p>To configure the dryer’s network settings, we need to connect the Watchdog’s LAN port to the computer via Ethernet and access the web interface at <code>http://10.0.0.1/setup</code>. On this screen, you’ll need to click “Configure”, which will bring up the possibility to use DHCP or a static IP address. In our case, we select the “static IP” option.</p>

<div>
<p><img alt="The Watchdog network configuration screen, to configure the static IP address used to connect to the dryer." src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2ceb582c1539a2d312fde85322f070fa42c21e38/ea792/assets/dryer/network-setup.png">
</p>
<p>
  Configuring the network settings on the grain dryer.
</p>
</div>

<p>On the next screen, we fill out the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Static IP address</li>
  <li>Subnet mask</li>
  <li>Gateway</li>
  <li>DNS1</li>
  <li>DNS2</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming that the static IP address provided by the cellular carrier is <code>241.2.31.59</code>, we’d fill out the fields as such:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Static IP address: <code>241.2.31.59</code> (static IP from the cellular carrier)</li>
  <li>Subnet mask: <code>255.255.255.0</code> (pretty standard stuff)</li>
  <li>Gateway: <code>241.2.31.1</code> (same as static IP, but last component is <code>1</code>)</li>
  <li>DNS1: <code>241.2.31.1</code> (we use the gateway as the DNS provider)</li>
  <li>DNS2: <code>8.8.8.8</code> (this is Google DNS, because why not)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once that’s done, save the network configuration, and turn off the grain dryer.</p>

<p>You may now connect the modem to the Watchdog module’s WAN port (as pictured a few paragraphs above).</p>

<p>Now, the moment of truth: turn on the dryer. You may …</p></article></div>

<p>Travelers aboard a luxury TransAtlantic cruise have shared pictures that many in the crypto community believe could provide clues on the missing 4 billion dollars raised during the EOS ICO. </p>



<p>DoubleSpend’s own analysis based on the size of the box show that it could very well contain the amount in USDs that was raised in the year-long ICO.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="45d72c63-4641-3f9f-f271-8df897413c12"><p>Alright the future of work is here to stay and we all need to prepare for the best remote work practices. Regardless of what happens, work has changed forever, people will go back to the office surely, but the dynamic will now be a hybrid mode.<br>‍</p><p>So learning how to work remotely will be a skill in your arsenal that might just propel you to your next career promotion. If you've asked yourself the question "how to work from home" - you've reached the right place.<br>‍</p><h4>1) Create a routine</h4><p>If you want to succeed working from home or working remotely this is a must, which is why it's the top position. You need to build a system that builds a body clock. I used to get into the zone when I got onto the train and grabbed by morning coffee at my office, when I couldn't do this anymore I spiraled. This was until I started building an atomic habit again, micro habits that signal the mind for whats about to happen next. Nowadays my trigger is early morning juice, similarly so, build a routine. Get out of bed, go to the gym, have a process.<br>‍</p><h4>2) Have your creative work space</h4><p>Separate your living, from your office space. Even if it means working from a coffee shop. You need to keep your area of comfort for leisure and work for work. This is an important work tip as separation of concerns as well as "environments" make a significant difference to motivation. Pretty much the same reason people go to libraries when they can read at home</p><p>‍</p><h4>3) Set time boundaries</h4><p>Its very easy to be sucked into 24 hour work when working from home. One of the keys to working remotely is creating time boundaries. Employers may feel like you're available to message after work hours. In addition you might get FOMO from all the slack notifications. Fight the urge, set your boundaries. 80% of 130 people I spoke to said they were constantly fatigued from working from home. This is a very important tip amongst other work from home tips and tricks. Stay disciplined to time<br>‍</p><h4>4) Leave home</h4><p>How to be productive working from home ? Leave your home. Ironic - I know but cabin fever can creep into you. As humans we need social interaction and movement. Step away from your home, go for a walk, meet a friend or better yet exercise. This will stimulate both your body muscles as well as your brain. Feeling fresh air graze your face makes a big difference, especially when you're glued to your screen<br>‍</p><h4>5) Plan meetings with work colleagues</h4><p>We've been remote for nearly 1.5 years now and I always advice social meetings for working remotely. Catch up with any team-mate in the same city as you and make it a monthly if not weekly thing. Building bonds with people in real life not only helps you create long lasting relationships, but also helps you connect deeper with another person. 70% of communication is non - verbal, which you miss out over zoom calls.<br>‍</p><h4>6) Reduce distractions</h4><p>"Minimise the number of distractions you have in your office" - simple yet sage advice for working remotely. We've got a concentration span of 12 seconds, with slack messages going off every moment combined with our innate nature of not wanting to miss out on important conversations leads us to doing absolutely no work at all. I encourage you to embrace an async first work culture, tools like <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly.co</a> help with async video meetings or even loom for screen recording.<br>‍</p><h4>7) Have no meeting Wednesdays</h4><p>Meets really hurt productivity. 72% of managers say meetings are a complete waste and 60% of employees think they will work better without meetings. This is the same reason Zoom fatigue is becoming a big issue, because you need to have your camera on and focus the entire time. Try encourage a culture where you have certain days with no meetings. Any conversation that needs to happen can occur in an asynchronous way, weather thats via tools like <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly.co</a> or vidyard. If you're reporting bugs, use feedback tools like bugheard or <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/show">remoteworkly.co/show</a></p><h4><br>8)Avoid unwanted meetings with conversation bloat</h4><p>Focus on getting work done, try set a decorum where you can leave meetings you're not needed in anymore. Teams that embrace the concept of async communication will win. This will reduce anxiety within teams, improve culture and make sure the meetings that do happen are purely focused on value and outcome. This can be done using tools like <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly.co</a> for async meetings and startups or even voice notes like recordify</p><h4><br>9)Start with the toughest task</h4><p>There's a science behind this but it works. We often think starting with easy tasks gives us the feeling of accomplishment and builds up momentum. There is some truth to this, however by the time you reach the tough/long task to complete you're left drained of energy and delay it to tomorrow, which never comes. Start with the toughest tasks, its the best way to be productive working from home<br>‍</p><h4>10)Over communicate</h4><p>There will be obvious disconnect between you and your team mates when you're remote. That is the nature of VoIP communication. So make sure you overcommunicate. This does not mean to spam people with 100 messages, but rather use video and tools that capture as much data as possible for you to make it easier for the other person to understand what you're doing without having to reach back to you."</p><h4><br>11)Leverage asynchronous communication</h4><p>My favorite tip in my list of remote work best practices. I strongly believe async communication is the way of the future. Leverage using async communication whenever and wherever possible without organizing impromptu/time blocking calls. There's several tools out there that let you take full advantage of async communication, <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/">remoteworkly</a>, <a href="http://loom.com/">loom</a>, <a href="http://vidyard.com/">vidyard</a>, <a href="http://marker.io/">marker</a> (for website feedback), <a href="http://remoteworkly.co/show">remoteworkly</a> (for QA feedback), <a href="http://trello.com/">trello</a>, <a href="http://asana.com/">asana<br>‍</a></p><h4>12)Use productivity hacks like pomodoro</h4><p>The pomodoro technique is one of the best productivity tips I came across. Its an old technique that lets you cut down your work into an investment reward balance. This builds another atomic habit loop where you learn to enjoy difficult tasks in anticipation of the reward. Your day is broken down into 25 minute work chunks of pure focus with 5 minute breaks, do this 4 times and then take a 20 minute break, rinse and repeat. Checkout timechi.com</p><h4><br>13)Share your project progress</h4><p>The easiest way to start working when you're feeling down or demotivated is by sharing your progress. Social accountability plays a big role in human motivation, something about putting our reputation at risk that kicks us in the behind. In addition, sharing your progress becomes a incredible feedback cycle, where you encourage others with your progress or cause them to reach out to you and motivate you to push faster. Lastly, having progress updates is a great way to look back and see how far you come, consequentially motivating you to work better</p><h4><br>14)Avoid jumping on impromptu phonecalls</h4><p>This rolls back to my earlier point about async conversations, Paul Graham mentioned that one of the downfalls of remote work is impromptu meetings where a large number of incredible ideas are usually generated is being robbed from todays workforce. Yes this is true, but on the flip side, most of the inefficiencies in working from an office came from these "tap on the shoulder" interruptions. I no longer pick up calls unless the message following up says "this is urgent", your concentration is sacred in 2020. Protect it at all costs.</p><h4><br>15)Set clear expectations for each day</h4><p>Employing a daily manifest of long term goals, short term goals, micro tasks as well as schedule has been a game changer in working remote. You almost get to "grade" each day in terms of the success you wanted to achieve and what you did achieve. This lets you work out what is the most effective work from home schedule for you. Each week, analyze the good days and bad days, pick up patterns that lead to bad days and those that lead to good days and optimize to focus on the good patterns.</p><h4><br>16Share with video whenever you can</h4><p>To prevent the feeling of isolation, use video software whenever you can. <a href="http://loom.com/">Loom</a> is a great place to begin, or even zoom for work meetings. I know it can be daunting at times, but it provides a great path to building deeper and more meaningful relationships with teams. PS - when you're chatting, look into the camera and not your screen. Makes double the impact</p><h4><br>17) Ask for one on one checkins</h4><p>Do NOT cancel your one on ones with your team mates, they're more important than every given there is no face to face relationship with your direct supervisor or subordinate. Use a template with a clear structure to find out how your team is doing, how things can be done better. This builds trust and encourages them to keep motivated even when people feel disconnected.<br>‍</p><h4>18) Bond with your team beyond work, get to learn about their family</h4><p>Use tools like <a href="http://donut.com/">donut</a> to encourage your team members to learn about each other. This is vital for new employees who don't have a chance to meet new people given you're restricted to a computer, donut runs introduction meetings between people. Encouraging that communication between new colleagues is a great way to improve team bond, morale and company culture</p><h4><br>19) Exercise</h4><p>Yes, do it. As human's we're not made to be seat potatoes. Despite how tasty potatoes are, you can't aspire to be one. Get out, hit the gym and exercise. The endorphins release as well as adrenaline rush you get post exercise is fundamental for peak performance. You won't find one successful person who doesn't preach for a daily exercise schedule</p><h4><br>20) Use noise filtering software</h4><p>Working at home with kids or even a dog can be very disturbing and sometimes embarrassing. Even though everyone is working remote, the noise of a grinder in the background whilst you're delivering your Q4 results can be quite distractive. Use tools like <a href="http://krisp.ai/">krisp</a> that magically cut out background noise and give you the confidence that regardless of who's speaking at the back, your colleagues won't be able to hear it.<br>‍</p><h4>21) Check in with 5 of your friends</h4><p>I assure you many of your friends will be …</p></div></div>

        <p>tl;dr — If you feel unfocused, grab a pen and paper and start writing your thoughts down.</p>
<p>Is there a question you are stuck on? A ambiguous goal you're trying to accomplish? Maybe a task you know you need to do but from which you keep getting distracted?</p>
<p><strong>Nothing will provide focus like pen and paper.</strong></p>
<p>It's all too easy these days to have a clear intention only to be sidetracked by the whirlpool of apps and services clawing for our attention on our devices.</p>
<p>It helps to take the time to groom our notification settings for importance and timeliness, but a digital device that we can use to complete nearly any task will never stand up to pen and paper in terms of it's ability to provide focus.</p>
<p>My thoughts are a constant whirlwind, I'm certainly more distractible than most, and interacting with nearly any online service only fuels that fire. So how can I get anything done if I'm unable to control my focus?</p>
<p><strong>Pen and paper.</strong> Whenever I catch myself stuck in the whirlpool, feeling not-great because I <em>know</em> I'm not doing what I want to be doing, or what I should be doing, I step away, grab pen and paper, and start writing.</p>
<p>The simple act of writing can focus my thoughts and attention in a way that nothing else can. Free from distractions, just a canvas to pour my thoughts into, and turn them into something with a sense of direction and purpose.</p>
<p>Writing is like a superpower to me. If there's any task I want to accomplish, the first step is always to write it down. Anytime I need to recenter myself on that task, I simply return to paper.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I've found that the simplest solutions are often the most powerful. So far I've found no simpler solution to start tackling any problem than to simply write it down, and then keep on writing.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>
   by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal &amp; Cheng Soon Ong.</b>
</p>
<p>this is my personal favorite book on the general math required for machine learning,
   the way things are described really resonate with me.
   available as a free pdf but i got a paper copy to support the authors after reading the
   first half.

<p><b><a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/">Linear Algebra and Learning from Data</a>
   by Gilbert Strang.</b>
</p>
<p>this is gilbert's most recent work. it's really great, he's such a good teacher, and
   <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">his freely available lectures</a>
   are even better. it's a shorter text than his other classic intro below with
   more of a focus on how things are connected to modern machine learning techniques.

<p><b><a href="https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/">Introduction to Linear Algebra</a>
   by Gilbert Strang.</b>
</p>
<p>this was my favorite linear algebra book for a long time before his 'learning from
   data' came out. this is a larger book with a more comprehensive view of linear algebra.

<p><b><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/">Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers</a> by Allen Downey.</b>
</p>
<p>this book focuses on practical computation methods for probability and statistics.
   i got a lot out of working through this one.
   it's all in python and available for free.
   ( exciting update! as part of writing this post i've discovered there's a new edition
   to read!)

<p><b><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/">Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</a>
   by John Kruscgke</b>
</p>
<p>on the bayesian side of things this is the book i've most enjoyed working through.
   i've only got the first edition which was R and
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBUGS">BUGS</a> but i see
   the second edition is R,
   <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> and
   <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>.
   it'd be fun i'm sure to work through it doing
   everything in <a href="https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro">numpyro</a>. i might do that in all
   my free time. haha. "free time" hahaha. sob.

<p><b><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a>
   by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman</b>
</p>
<p>this is still one of the most amazing fundamental machine learning books i've ever had.
   in fact i've purchased this book <em>twice</em> and given it away both times :/ i might buy another
   copy some time soon, even though it's been freely available to download for ages. an
   amazing piece of work.

</p>
<p>this is an epic textbook that i'd love to understand better. i've read a couple of sections in
   detail but not the entire tome yet.

</p>
<p>this is probably the best overall machine learning text book i've ever read. such a beautiful book
   and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf">the pdf is FREE FOR DOWNLOAD!!!</a>

<p><b><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-1">Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</a> by Kevin Murphy</b>
</p>
<p>this is my second favorite general theory text on machine learning.
   i got kevin to sign my copy when he was passing my desk once but
   someone borrowed it and never gave it back :(
   so if you see a copy with my name on the spine let me know!

<p><b><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</a> by Aurélien Géron</b>
</p>
<p>this is the book i point most people to when they are interested in getting up
   to speed with modern applied machine learning without too much concern for the
   theory. it's very up to date (as much as a book can be) with the latest libraries
   and, most importantly, provides a good overview of not just neural stuff but fundamental
   <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> as well.

<p><b><a href="http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php">Machine Learning Engineering</a> by Andriy Burkov</b>
</p>
<p>a great book focussing on the operations side of running a machine learning system. i'm a bit
   under half way through the free online version and very likely to buy a physical copy to finish
   it and support the author. great stuff and, in many ways, a more impactful book than any of
   the theory books here.

</p>
<p>this is another one that was also on my list from ten years ago and though it's section
   on neural networks is a bit of chuckle these days there is still a bunch of really
   great fundamental stuff in this book. very practical and easy to digest. i also see there's
   a second edition now. i reckon this would compliment the "hands on" book above very well.

<p><b><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/">Speech and Language Processing</a>

</p>
<p>still the best overview of NLP there is (IMHO). can't wait to read the 3rd edition which
   apparently will cover more modern stuff (e.g. transformers) but until then, for the
   love of god though, please don't be one of those "this entire book is
   irrelevant now! just fine tune BERT" people :/

<p>this book is super hard core and maybe more an operations
   research book than machine learning. though i've not read it cover to cover the
   couple of bits i've worked through really taught me a lot. i'd love to understand
   the stuff in this text better; it's so so fundamental to machine learning (and more)

<p>writing a book specifically on deep learning is very dangerous since things move so fast but
   if anyone can do it, ian can... i think ian's approach to explaining neural networks
   from the ground up is one of my favorites. i got the first edition hardback but it's free to
   download from the website.

November 8, 2020 | https://www.shreya-shankar.com/modeling-libraries/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shreya-shankar.com/modeling-libraries/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When building the first machine learning pipelines for my company, I agonized over which modeling libraries to include in our stack. What would most model developers want to use? I felt strongly about scikit-learn and PyTorch, but what would be the consequences of imposing my opinions on ML frameworks on our company’s infrastructure? Which modeling library would “win” in the long-term? What if I wrote modeling code in a DSL that would become obsolete in a few years?</p>
<p>In 2016, I took an introductory deep learning class with assignments all in Tensorflow; my most recent deep learning course was completely conducted in PyTorch. Four years later, <a href="https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/">it seems like all ML researchers I know use PyTorch</a>. The few who don’t use PyTorch use TF 1.0, with the “some day I’ll switch to TF 2.0 or PyTorch” mantra. What happened?</p>
<p>Over several months, I realized that <strong>the choice of library does not matter, as modeling is just a tiny step in the machine learning pipeline.</strong> Other steps are equally, if not more, challenging to maintain: for example, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/oedq/successful-data-migration-wp-1555708.pdf">it is much harder to migrate data pipeline code</a> than rewrite basic TF modeling code in PyTorch. I’ve written models in TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, scikit-learn, and LightGBM for different tasks for my company. I’ve even written non-Python models in Scala. When I iterate on machine learning pipelines for a prediction task, I avoid changing the model architectures as much as possible since <a href="https://www.shreya-shankar.com/making-ml-work/">I’d rather change parts of the pipeline I understand better</a>, like data ingestion and better featurization. My company’s pull requests show that people hardly touch their modeling code compared to pipeline code. What matters is having the infrastructure to “plug and play” ML model trainers and predictors, since there is almost never one programming library that meets all needs. </p>
<p>Some would point to the trends of researchers overwhelmingly preferring PyTorch and JAX and argue that a winner here actually does matter, because researchers turn into data scientists at companies, these data scientists build models, and the models will get productionized and used “forever.” But as a field, we’re still struggling with productionizing models, aligning their outputs with human incentives, iterating on these systems, and trusting these pipelines. For any ML practitioners outside “big tech,” their biggest problems are model pipelines and value alignment between customers, themselves, and machines. After all, these are essential to product development. Even if we built frameworks for these central problems, the modeling library still won’t matter because <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/390687">multiple software frameworks for a problem can happily coexist</a>. People are smart and can easily learn a different framework — the fact that there was such a large, rapid <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-shifting-from-TensorFlow-to-PyTorch">transition from TensorFlow to PyTorch</a> within a few years proves that developers will find the best tool for their job. It matters more that they have the correct foundation for software they build.</p>
<p>Additionally, business considerations can override the choice of framework or even build new frameworks, particularly in startups. My company’s codebase for a particular ML problem has experienced something in this vein: first, I wrote experimental code in my DSLs of choice to “solve” the problem. Then when we had to build a product, I <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">rewrote</a> the pipeline. Then when we pivoted slightly, I <a href="https://refactoring.com/">refactored</a> the pipeline to produce the live ML product we’re regularly releasing today. As I gained more clarity on the current version of the product and how other stakeholders (technical or nontechnical) might interact with it, I realized these business considerations drove pipeline development more than the modeling libraries or my opinions on other DSLs.</p>
<p>So the horse race of modeling libraries is misleading, and the most challenging problems in “real-world” ML right now revolve around business values, productionization, miniaturization, and pipelining for repeated training and inference. But since <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos109/06langs.pdf">programming languages</a> and infrastructure <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2015/05/20/javas-20-years-of-innovation">drive innovation in software</a>, it’s still worth thinking about the evolution of modeling libraries. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959">The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</a>, Fred Brooks introduces the concept of the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second-system effect</a></em> to be “the tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems, due to inflated expectations and overconfidence.” Famous examples include the IBM System/360 operating system (which succeeded the IBM 700/7000 series from the 1950s), and the Multics operating system (which succeeded Compatible Time-Sharing System from the late 1960s). </p>
<p>I consider TF 1.0 a success: it accelerated a lot of deep learning research, was fairly narrow and thoughtful in scope, and spearheaded innovation in the hardware vertical with XLA compilation, TPUs, and more. But over time, as hundreds of TensorFlow engineers tried to address the software’s limitations and turn TensorFlow into a machine learning library for everybody, it suffered from the second-system effect and became TF 2.0, a machine learning library for nobody (possibly except for Google). One set of problems they tried to address is “making models work in production settings:” TFX is a great example of an <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/09/brief-history-of-tensorflow-extended-tfx.html">overhyped</a> and <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/tfx">underused</a> TF 2.0 tool. Compare the PyPI stats with <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/kfp">Kubeflow</a>’s for context; TFX built their framework to fit nicely with Kubeflow and Kubeflow users still don’t want to use TFX. This is not to say the problems with production ML aren’t real; rather, it seems TFX currently isn’t <em>the</em> solution to many of these incredibly challenging problems. Having tutorials doesn’t help if the <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/deep-dive-into-ml-models-in-production-using-tfx-and-kubeflow">UX is counterintuitive and engineers need to become professional error log parsers</a> to become proficient with the tool.</p>
<p>All this being said about my criticism for the TensorFlow UX, I actually use TF 2.0 at work — mainly out of laziness. The Spark to TFRecord to TFData to TF model pipeline is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem/tree/master/spark/spark-tensorflow-connector">partially</a> <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/load-data/tfrecords-save-load.html">documented</a>, whereas the Spark to TFRecord to something to PyTorch model pipeline is only <a href="https://github.com/uber/petastorm">barely</a> <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/06/16/simplify-data-conversion-from-apache-spark-to-tensorflow-and-pytorch.html">documented</a>. But the DSL for my models is hardly something I think about on a day-to-day basis, since most of my problems aren’t “how quickly can I code up a transformer or convnet architecture from scratch.” People in this industry rarely build things from scratch. Software products are built on the <a href="https://effectivesoftwaredesign.com/2014/11/02/the-minimum-viable-product-and-incremental-software-development/">principle of incrementality</a>; code and features accumulate over time. </p>
<p>So my answer to my original question is that it’s not worth worrying about which modeling library will “win” in the long run, because <strong>multiple libraries can win if they each do something important</strong>, such as championing the dataflow paradigm or easy autodifferentiation. If you’re an engineer, don’t build your pipelines around a specific modeling library. If you’re a researcher or data scientist, don’t worry about learning all the modeling libraries or whatever libraries the company’s job description mentions. Software history indicates that the modeling framework bloat is inevitable, and for as long as these libraries’ biggest priorities are to compete with each other, they will all converge to the same solutions to mission-critical modeling problems — <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/eager-execution-imperative-define-by.html">eager execution</a>, ease of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner">building a model from scratch</a>, ability to <a href="https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loggers.html">nicely view loss curves</a>, and more. But these are only a fraction of most “real-world” machine learning problems, and you, as a machine learning practitioner, at the end of the day aren’t hired only for your expertise in training a model once; you’re hired to make a machine learning system consistently deliver value to an end user.</p>

	  <p><span>The American people deserve an urgent, robust, and professional response to the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. President-elect Biden believes that the federal government must act swiftly and aggressively to help protect and support our families, small businesses, first responders, and caregivers essential to help us face this challenge, those who are most vulnerable to health and economic impacts, and our broader communities – not to blame others or bail out corporations. </span></p>

  <div>
	<div>
	  <div>
	   <p>The Biden-Harris administration will always:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen to science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ensure public health decisions are informed by public health professionals</strong></li>
<li><strong>Promote trust, transparency, common purpose, and accountability in our government</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris have a seven-point plan to beat COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure all Americans have access to regular, reliable, and free testing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Double the number of drive-through testing sites.</li>
<li>Invest in next-generation testing, including at home tests and instant tests, so we can scale up our testing capacity by orders of magnitude.</li>
<li>Stand up a Pandemic Testing Board like Roosevelt’s War Production Board. It’s how we produced tanks, planes, uniforms, and supplies in record time, and it’s how we will produce and distribute tens of millions of tests.</li>
<li>Establish a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize at least 100,000 Americans across the country with support from trusted local organizations in communities most at risk to perform culturally competent approaches to contact tracing and protecting at-risk populations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix personal protective equipment (PPE) problems for good.</strong></p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden is taking responsibility and giving states, cities, tribes, and territories the critical supplies they need.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of masks, face shields, and other PPE so that the national supply of personal protective equipment exceeds demand and our stores and stockpiles — especially in hard-hit areas that serve disproportionately vulnerable populations — are fully replenished.</li>
<li>Build immediately toward a future, flexible American-sourced and manufactured capability to ensure we are not dependent on other countries in a crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Provide clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance for how communities should navigate the pandemic – and the resources for schools, small businesses, and families to make it through.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social distancing is not a light switch. It is a dial. President-elect Biden will direct the CDC to provide specific evidence-based guidance for how to turn the dial up or down relative to the level of risk and degree of viral spread in a community, including when to open or close certain businesses, bars, restaurants, and other spaces; when to open or close schools, and what steps they need to take to make classrooms and facilities safe; appropriate restrictions on size of gatherings; when to issue stay-at-home restrictions.</li>
<li>Establish a renewable fund for state and local governments to help prevent budget shortfalls, which may cause states to face steep cuts to teachers and first responders.</li>
<li>Call on Congress to pass an emergency package to ensure schools have the additional resources they need to adapt effectively to COVID-19.</li>
<li>Provide a “restart package” that helps small businesses cover the costs of operating safely, including things like plexiglass and PPE.</li>
</ul>

	   <p><strong>Plan for the effective, equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines — because development isn’t enough if they aren’t effectively distributed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invest $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.</li>
<li>Ensure that politics plays no role in determining the safety and efficacy of any vaccine. The following 3 principles will guide the Biden-Harris administration: Put scientists in charge of all decisions on safety and efficacy; publicly release clinical data for any vaccine the FDA approves; and authorize career staff to write a written report for public review and permit them to appear before Congress and speak publicly uncensored.</li>
<li>Ensure everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected — in America receives the protection and care they deserve, and consumers are not price gouged as new drugs and therapies come to market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protect older Americans and others at high risk.</strong></p>
<p>President-elect Biden understands that older Americans and others at high-risk are most vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force, as proposed by Vice President-elect Harris, to provide recommendations and oversight on disparities in the public health and economic response. At the end of this health crisis, it will transition to a permanent Infectious Disease Racial Disparities Task Force.</li>
<li>Create the Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard that Americans can check in real-time to help them gauge whether local transmission is actively occurring in their zip codes. This information is critical to helping all individuals, but especially older Americans and others at high risk, understand what level of precaution to take.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rebuild and expand defenses to predict, prevent, and mitigate pandemic threats, including those coming from China.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, originally established by the Obama-Biden administration.</li>
<li>Immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization, which — while not perfect — is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic.</li>
<li>Re-launch and strengthen U.S. Agency for International Development’s pathogen-tracking program called PREDICT.</li>
<li>Expand the number of CDC’s deployed disease detectives so we have eyes and ears on the ground, including rebuilding the office in Beijing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implement mask mandates nationwide by working with governors and mayors and by asking the American people to do what they do best: step up in a time of crisis.</strong></p>
<p>Experts agree that tens of thousands of lives can be saved if Americans wear masks. President-elect Biden will continue to call on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their household.</li>
<li>Every Governor to make that mandatory in their state.</li>
<li>Local authorities to also make it mandatory to buttress their state orders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we succeed in getting beyond this pandemic, we must ensure that the millions of Americans who suffer long-term side effects from COVID don’t face higher premiums or denial of health insurance because of this new pre-existing condition. The Biden-Harris Administration will work to ensure that the protections for those with pre-existing conditions that were won with Obamacare are protected. And, they will work to lower health care costs and expand access to quality, affordable health care through a Medicare-like public option.</p>

    <p>Overview</p>
    <p>In networking, a <span>Tunnel</span> is used to encapsulate a communication protocol that is not supported
        by the network inside a protocol that is supported by the network.</p>
    <p>The following are some of terms used in this article:</p>
    <table id="col2-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Term</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><span>SSH</span></td>
          <td>short for <span>S</span>ecure <span>SH</span>ell is a protocol that sets
            up an encrypted connection between two nodes over an unsecured network using a Client-Server architecture</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>SSH Server</span></td>
          <td>a server that listens on the TCP port <span>22</span> for incoming SSH client
            requests, then authenticates those client requests, and provides a command prompt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>SSH Client</span></td>
          <td>a client used to connect to the remote SSH Server on a specific network node</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>SSH Tunnel</span></td>
          <td>a method of encapsulating and transmitting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH
            connection between a client node and a server node</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>SSH Port Forwarding</span></td>
          <td>another name for <span>SSH Tunnel</span></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>So, why do we need <span>tunneling</span> ??? The following are some of the reasons:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>To allow access to legacy applications or unsecure services such as IMAP, POP3, VNC, etc</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To implement a virtual private network (<span>VPN</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To allow access to services behind a firewall</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>There are <span>3</span> types of <span>SSH Tunnel</span> options as listed below:</p>
      <ol id="blue-ol">
        <li>
          <p><span>Local</span> Port Forwarding</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Remote</span> Port Forwarding</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Dynamic</span> Port Forwarding</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>We will discuss and demonstrate each of the above options in the following sections.</p>
    <p>Setup</p>
    <p>The setup will be on a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS based Linux desktop. For the demonstrations, we will create an environment with
        3 virtual machines running on the hypervisor <span>VirtualBox</span>.</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the environment setup:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/ssh-tunnel-2.png" alt="Environment"></p><p>Environment</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following are some of the highlights of the 3 virtual machines:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>vm-1</span> :: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, Ubuntu 20.04 OS, and uses a single virtual network
            interface with <span>NAT</span> networking (<span>10.0.2.15</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>vm-2</span> :: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, Ubuntu 20.04 OS, and uses a single virtual network
            interface with <span>Host-only</span> networking (<span>192.168.56.104</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>vm-3</span> :: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, Ubuntu 20.04 OS, and uses a two separate virtual
            network interfaces - one with <span>NAT</span> networking (<span>10.0.2.4</span>) and the
            other with <span>Host-only</span> networking (<span>192.168.56.103</span>)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Open a Terminal window in each of the 3 virtual machines <span>vm-1</span> thru <span>vm-3</span>
        and install <span>Python Flask</span>, <span>Net Tools</span>, and <span>SSH Server
        </span> by executing the following command:</p>
    <p>$ sudo apt install python3-flask net-tools openssh-server -y</p>

    <div>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Resources covering software development under Inferno are fairly scarce.</p>
<p>As such, this post aims to provide a start-to-finish demonstration of program development in Limbo inside Inferno.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This post assumes you’re using Inferno, specifically <a href="https://code.9front.org/hg/purgatorio/">purgatorio</a>, hosted under <code>linux/amd64</code> or similar.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use Inferno under Docker as per the <code>INSTALL</code> file.</p>
<p>Other platforms are supported, but steps may differ here or there.</p>
<p>The rune <code>$</code> indicates a unix shell command under <code>bash</code>, probably.</p>
<p>The rune <code>;</code> or <code>%</code> indicates a command to be run from inside Inferno.</p>
<p>The final source from this post: <a href="https://github.com/henesy/socketh-limbo">https://github.com/henesy/socketh-limbo</a></p>
<p>This post will be an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/henesy/SocketH">SocketH</a> which was originally written in Go and has a few other implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/henesy/socketh-myr">https://github.com/henesy/socketh-myr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/henesy/SocketS">https://github.com/henesy/SocketS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The original code isn’t great, but it gives a target for what we want to create.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Many, if not all, of these development steps prior to <em>running</em> the final Dis bytecode can be done from outside of Inferno.</p>
<p>The limbo compiler can be called as <code>limbo</code> and with the right workflow development may be more pleasant.</p>
<p>This post assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development occurs inside of Inferno for the purpose of consistency</li>
<li>Some knowledge about imperative, C-like, language programming</li>
<li>Some knowledge about how unix-like systems work</li>
<li>Some knowledge about how C-like compiler and linker flows work</li>
<li>Knowledge about how to interact with a unix-like shell</li>
<li>Vague knowledge about Inferno, such as the fact Inferno exists ☺</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-inferno">Build Inferno</h3>
<p>Steps provided are targeted for <code>linux/amd64</code> as a host for Inferno.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/inferno-os/">Inferno</a> tree is hosted over <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://code.9front.org/hg/purgatorio/">purgatorio</a> fork is hosted by the 9front project over <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>.</p>

<p>Limbo ‘libraries’, known as ‘modules’, and ‘programs’ are one and the same in terms of semantics, bar ‘libraries’ having module <code>.m</code> files which are similar to header <code>.h</code> files in C.</p>
<p>As such, the boilerplate for most Limbo programs is very similar. We can initialize our main file as follows.</p>
<p><code>socketh.b</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">implement SocketH;

include <span>"sys.m"</span>;
	<span>sys</span>: Sys;

include <span>"draw.m"</span>;
include <span>"arg.m"</span>;

<span>SocketH</span>: module {
	<span>init</span>: fn(<span>nil</span>: ref Draw<span>-&gt;</span>Context, <span>argv</span>: list of string);
};


<span># An implementation of the SocketH chat protocol
</span><span></span>init(<span>nil</span>: ref Draw<span>-&gt;</span>Context, <span>argv</span>: list of string) {
	sys <span>=</span> load Sys Sys<span>-&gt;</span>PATH;
	<span>arg</span> :<span>=</span> load Arg Arg<span>-&gt;</span>PATH;
	<span>if</span>(arg <span>==</span> nil)
		raise <span>"could not load arg"</span>;



	exit;
}
</code></pre></div><p>We can break this down a bit.</p>
<p><code>implement</code> declares a module by name.</p>
<p>A module definition must be provided indicating exported functions from the module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">SocketH: module {
	init: fn(nil: ref Draw-&gt;Context, argv: list of string);
};
</code></pre></div><p>Note how a variable name of <code>nil</code> is used to drop assignment of a value.</p>
<p>The <code>init</code> function is special in shell-loaded Limbo programs and its signature <em>must</em> match what the shell expects the init function interface to be.</p>
<p>Functionally, <code>init</code> is equivalent to <code>main</code> in most other languages.</p>
<p><code>include</code> imports an external module’s definitions into our scope.</p>
<p><code>load</code> performs the dynamic loading of a module at runtime.</p>
<p><code>exit</code> performs the dynamic un-loading of a module at runtime.</p>
<p><code>raise</code> will throw an exception with a given string as its content.</p>
<p>We refer to names inside a module using the <code>-&gt;</code> operator.</p>
<p>We can jointly assign and declare in one step using the <code>:=</code> operator.</p>
<p>Curly braces are optional.</p>
<p>Semicolons are not.</p>
<p>Note the absence of a reserved <code>main</code> module. This is due to each <code>.dis</code> file, potentially an independent module, being theoretically loadable in its own right. A reserved name would cause significant issues with namespaces ☺.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-a-workflow">Setting up a workflow</h3>
<p>Compiling our program should be as straightforward as running the Limbo compiler against our source file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">% limbo socketh.b
% lc
.git/		LICENSE		socketh.b
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.dis
% socketh.dis
%
</code></pre></div><p>This program does nothing right now, but that’s fine.</p>
<p>Note how we can omit the <code>./</code> when running <code>.dis</code> programs.</p>
<p>Calling the limbo compiler each time is a bit of a pain, and if we start using commandline flags this will become tedious to type.</p>
<p>In acme, we could type the text we want to run in a tag or window and middle-click said text to run the compilation (or more!) on-demand. In Inferno, acme comes with a <code>Limbo</code> command in the default window tag, but that only works for one file.</p>
<p>We can simplify this process by writing a <s>makefile</s> <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/mk/">mkfile</a>!</p>
<p><code>mkfile</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">&lt;/mkconfig

DISBIN = /dis

TARG = socketh.dis

&lt;/mkfiles/mkdis
</code></pre></div><p>Mk semantics are similar to make with some changes.</p>
<p>How mk will behave inside Inferno using the <code>mkdis</code> mkfile as the trailing import:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mk can import outside mkfiles using the <code>&lt;</code> operator</li>
<li><code>mk</code> will call <code>mk all</code> which resolves to the <code>all</code> (default) target</li>
<li><code>mk install</code> calls the <code>all</code> target and copies the <code>TARG</code> file(s) to the <code>DISBIN</code> destination directory</li>
<li><code>mk clean</code> removes files such as <code>.dis</code> and <code>.sbl</code> from the working directory</li>
<li><code>mk nuke</code> calls the <code>clean</code> target as well as delete the ‘target’ files such as the <code>/dis/socketh</code> binary if the <code>install</code> target has been called</li>
</ul>
<p>A demonstration:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">% lc
.git/		LICENSE		mkfile
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.b
% mk
limbo -I/module -gw socketh.b
socketh.b:15: warning: argument argv not referenced
% lc
.git/		LICENSE		mkfile		socketh.dis
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.b	socketh.sbl
% mk install
rm -f /dis/socketh.dis &amp;&amp; cp socketh.dis /dis/socketh.dis
% mk clean
rm -f *.dis *.sbl
% whatis socketh
/dis/socketh.dis
% mk nuke
rm -f *.dis *.sbl
cd /dis; rm -f socketh.dis
% whatis socketh.dis
socketh.dis: not found
% lc
.git/		LICENSE		mkfile
.gitignore	README.md	socketh.b
%
</code></pre></div><p>Note the Limbo compiler flags being passed by default now for the <code>all</code> target.</p>
<p>At this point, I usually add <code>mk clean &amp;&amp; mk</code> to my acme tag and run that for multi-file or more complex Limbo programs. This flow is very similar to how I do development under Plan 9.</p>
<h3 id="common-patterns">Common patterns</h3>
<h4 id="commandline-flags">Commandline flags</h4>
<p>We can use <a href="https://seh.dev/limbo-intro/man.postnix.pw/purgatorio/2/arg">arg(2)</a> to process commandline flags:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>…</span>

	exit;

<p>Like a tightly written function, I prefer to exit early if no work should be done. So, if you disagree with these definitions and assumptions, now’s a good time to stop reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable productivity:</strong> The maximum rate of quality work output, without loss to the wellbeing of the developer</li>
<li><strong>Quality work:</strong> Software that meets requirements, is valuable to users, is maintainable, and is as bug free as possible</li>
<li><strong>Attention:</strong> The limited mental capacity to focus on a task</li>
<li>Sustainable productivity is desired</li>
<li>Attention is essential to sustainable productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>My high-level workflow looks something like this: identify the problem to solve; think on the problem and let ideas percolate; research, discuss, and experiment with these ideas; implement and test the solution; deliver and maintain the solution.</p>
<p>This cycle could repeat many times in a day. Or I could spend days stuck on a single cycle step. Every step in this cycle requires attention. The more attention I can devote, the more cycles I can complete, and the more productive I am.</p>
<p>How long you can focus on a task varies by person. Some people are very good at it out of the box, some people, not so much. Regardless of the hand you were dealt, I believe that focus (the act of devoting your attention) is a skill, and like any skill, can be improved with practice.</p>
<p>So, how can you increase your attention reserves? The most bang for your buck is to organize your outside world in such a way that it’s distraction free as possible. Once you do that, you’ll have more time to practice, and therefore more time to get better.</p>
<p><strong>Build physical strength.</strong> The damage done by sitting 8+ hours a day is underrated. You need a way to offset this damage, especially if you plan to work in this field for decades. Opinions abound on this topic, but I personally prefer deadlifts. There are few movements more primal than picking a heavy object off the ground and standing up with it. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc">learn correct technique in little time</a>. I most like deadlifts because you can do them safely, at high weights, into old age. I also like the hand, back, and hip strength they give, to make it that much harder for sitting damage to have its way with you.</p>
<p><strong>Make your place of work boring and tidy.</strong> My office is a spare bedroom. The walls are blank. There’s no tv. There’s a desk, chair, laptop, laptop stand, keyboard, mouse, and mouse pad. There’s a window, which lets enough light in so that I don’t feel like I’m missing a beautiful day, but not too much light to cause screen glare. If I need to work with paper, it’s immediately filed somewhere when done. Like I said, boring and tidy.</p>
<p><strong>Make your smart phone dumb.</strong> My phone has all notifications disabled, except for calls and text messages. Well, and National Hurricane Center alerts, since I live in Louisiana. Unless you’re my wife, you know that I don’t respond to text messages immediately, that’s just how it is. I disabled my social media accounts some time ago. But if you have them, turning off notifications should help curve the urge to compulsively check them.</p>
<p><strong>Be an OS minimalist.</strong> Apps I use less commonly are a keypress combo away. Given this, my dock has only the apps I use on a daily basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>File system explorer</li>
<li>Internet browser</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>Text editor for front-end code and notes</li>
<li>IDE for back-end code</li>
<li>IDE for database</li>
<li>Visual file differ for version control</li>
<li>Email client</li>
<li>Instant message client</li>
</ul>
<p>My desktop alternates between clean and dirty states. Files I’m currently working with live on the desktop. Then they’re filed away into sensible folders when done.</p>
<p><strong>Organize your browser bookmarks.</strong> When I read something useful that I may need to reference later, I file it under a general archive folder. Then more specific items get their own folders. Frequently accessed links are visible on my bookmarks bar under their own folder.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize meetings.</strong> Look, I know some things make sense to discuss face to face, or voice to voice. But if they don’t, then you don’t need a meeting. An email or instant message will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">The Eisenhower Method</a> to categorize your tasks.</strong> Imagine a grid of 4 quadrants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Important and Not Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Not Urgent</li>
</ul>
<p>Important and Urgent tasks have to be dealt with. For me, these are usually major production issues.</p>
<p>Important and Not Urgent tasks should absorb the bulk of your time. For me, this is the plain old development work of implementing features, fixing bugs, and making existing code more maintainable and performant. Also included are building relationships with others and planning ahead.</p>
<p>Not Important and Urgent tasks are nasty attention thieves. They shout out to you in immediacy, but offer little value in return. You know what these are for you. For me, these are most often lazily asked questions, where the asker did not do their due diligence, and expects a top-notch answer immediately. Also included are last-minute meetings, and over-talkative coworkers.</p>
<p>Not Important and Not Urgent tasks are usually not known to your users. Take internal documentation updates as an example. Thing is, they’re an investment in yourself, which means a more productive future “you”. So don’t forget to show them some love in your spare moments.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 08 November 2020</em></p><p>A few days ago I had the displeasure of helping a friend reinstall Windows on
their laptop, which had previously contained Ubuntu. The reason for their switch
isn’t that important – although I helpfully suggested keeping Linux, it was
their machine and their decision. I didn’t expect the process to be particularly
difficult. After all, I work on operating systems for a living now, so I didn’t
expect any trouble. But to my surprise, I encountered a nearly dystopian
situation before I even got to the desktop.</p>

<p>I started the process by creating a bootable USB from the ISO downloaded from
Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO">download page</a>. It feels weird writing that, but yes, the ISO
seems to be freely, easily downloaded. No product key was required to download,
or even install. The USB creation process was not easy (Microsoft suggests using
Windows to create the bootable USB, a chicken-and-egg problem if ever there was
one). It seems that the standard <code>dd</code> process used by every Linux vendor does
not work here – instead you need to get the correct magic incantations of
partition types and filesystems, and then copy files from the ISO file into the
USB. I ended up falling back to a tool called <a href="https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB">WoeUSB</a> to do this process,
after three failed manual attempts.</p>

<p>The real fun started after I (finally) successfully booted from the USB and
started through the installation wizard. Cortana loudly greeted me, telling me
she’d walk me through the installation process using my voice. I must say that,
while I don’t really care to have a voice assistant guide me through OS
installation, I can see it helping a lot of folks out there, if it works
properly (I did not test it). I’m glad that Microsoft is at least trying this
out!</p>

<p>I went through the (impressively quick) installation process, and the laptop
automatically rebooted. It prompted me to connect to the Internet, which I
foolishly did. Directly after connecting to WiFi, the wizard asked me to login
with a Microsoft account!</p>

<p>I chuckled internally. “Classic Microsoft, asking for a silly cloud login just
to use Windows,” I thought. I don’t know my friend’s MS account login, and even
if I did I wouldn’t link their OS account to some cloud account!</p>

<p>I searched for the cancel button, but couldn’t find one. I tried to submit the
form with empty username and password, but that didn’t work. Realizing that I
might be trapped, I got my phone and fired up Google.  Surely, Microsoft
wouldn’t make it <em>impossible</em> to setup a new PC without linking it to their
cloud, right?</p>

<p>I found an <a href="https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/how-to-setup-windows-10-without-a-microsoft-account/">article</a> which said that, by disabling the Internet connection I
had just configured, I could skip the login process. So, I hit the back button
on the installer. The wizard animated for a moment as if it was working, and
then showed me the same login screen. No matter how many times I hit the back
button, the wizard did not let me go back to the Internet configuration page!</p>

<p>“They haven’t got me yet,” I thought. I held down the power button and rebooted
the computer. Certainly on reboot I would restart the process, and could skip
the Internet configuration, right?</p>

<p>The laptop rebooted to a Microsoft Account login page.</p>

<p>So, I did what any self-respecting, conscientious friend would do for a friend:
<strong>I reinstalled Windows all over again.</strong>  This time, during the setup wizard
after the reboot, I skipped configuring an Internet connection. I was greeted
with this page:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-nointernet.png" alt="win10-nointernet"></p>

<p>This, to me, felt kind of chilling. After all, it’s not like I asked not to use
a MS account. All I did was decide not to configure Internet on my first boot,
which has nothing to do with linking a MS account. After all, maybe I just don’t
have Internet access at the moment, or maybe I forgot the WiFi password.  Why
should the installer lecture me about the benefits of a MS account when simply I
did not configure WiFi? It felt obvious that this was a bald-faced statement:
“we know you’re avoiding our login process, and in a few years we’ll get rid of
this loophole too. Welcome to the future!”</p>

<p>I clicked the text (which wasn’t highlighted as a link or as a button) which
said “Continue with limited setup”. This was an odd phrasing, given that none of
the operating system features I’m familiar with (scheduling processes, providing
a unified interface to hardware devices, etc) requires a cloud account.</p>

<p>At this point, I was allowed to create a “local account” for my friend, and
finish the setup. I was presented with a list of preferences, all helpfully
enabled by default:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-privacy.png" alt="win10-privacy"></p>

<p>The irony here is beautiful. Ads “may be less relevant to you”. The only entity
this harms is Microsoft, being able to avertise at you less (within your very
<em>operating system</em>, no less). Why should they bill this as a negative?</p>

<p>After disabling all of the toggles, the desktop loaded for the first time, I
noticed the following at the bottom right:</p>

<p>I used MS Edge to install Firefox, and closed it out. On reboot, the login
screen contained two advertisements (!!!) for MS Edge. I returned the laptop to
my friend, grateful I didn’t have to use this horror show of an operating
system.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-even-matter">Why does this even matter?</h2>

<p>I spend my workday working on operating systems. Don’t get me wrong, I’m new to
the field, and I have a lot to learn. But as far as I know, <strong>there is no
feature in a modern operating system which requires a cloud account login.</strong> (I
would love to be educated if this claim is false, please get in touch!)</p>

<p>I used to spend my career working on machine learning and data analysis. One
thing I remember from my “past life” is that <strong>there’s nothing better than
linking different types of identifiers together.</strong> If Microsoft can track you by
your “Windows installation ID” and also by your “Microsoft Account”, then <em>of
course</em> they want to link those two identifiers together.</p>

<p>More links means more data about you. What applications you run, what sites you
visit, etc. An operating system as at the root of what you trust when you use a
computer. Do you use online banking? Your operating system can read the password
to your bank account, the balances, and more, directly out of memory! I’m not
suggesting that Windows does that – I just want to illustrate the sort of trust
you implicitly use every time you login to your bank account on Windows (or Mac
OS for that matter). But maybe Microsoft just looks at how frequently you login
to your computer, or what sites you’re interested in. What DNS queries does your
OS resolve? What IP addresses have you used in the last 90 days?</p>

<p>All of the data which is obvious to your operating system, can be linked to your
personal identity when you connect it to a cloud account. Don’t get me wrong,
even if you don’t connect it to a cloud account, you still are getting
incredible amounts of telemetry and tracking recording your every move. But why
would you voluntarily give more links and data to Microsoft?</p>

<p>I don’t think most people understand the sort of data they’re giving over to
Microsoft when they login and use Windows. These dark patterns that Microsoft
employs are sickeningly obvious, and really difficult to avoid. Why would I
trust a company that tries to manipulate its customers into such total data
collection, to be responsible with the data it receives?</p>

<p>I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be to be an operating system developer
at Microsoft. I have a lot of respect for the operating system kernel they make.
It seems to be one of the few major non-Unix like kernels out there. It seems
fascinating and I’d love to learn more about it. But it must be frustrating to
see the product of your hard work go out packaged with software capable of
collecting and tracking your users’ every move, and thrown together with an
installer intent on forcing them to submit to this data collection.</p>

                    <div><p>After listening to over 100 Nathan Latka Podcasts, observing 200 Indiehacker podcasts and watching 50 Microconf talks AND recording 80 episodes myself.</p><p>Here's what I've observed:</p><p><strong>SEO</strong><br>Over 70% of founders credited SEO for being their best source of growth. Invest into ASAP and build up that MOAT.</p><p><strong>FB / Social Media</strong><br>Its a hit or miss. Don't waste time curating the perfect Ad or post. Tim Doyle of Eucalyptus shared that his most profitable Ad was not some high quality video but rather a Doge meme.</p><p><strong>Velocity is everything</strong><br>When building companies you NEED to move fast, there is no alternative to it.</p><p><strong>Product</strong><br>Product led growth is the BEST type, its natural and doesn't feel forced.</p><p><strong>Distribution</strong><br>This is probably just as much if not more important than the content or product itself. Build with distribution in mind, articles / SEO or products.</p><p><strong>SLC</strong><br>NO ONE wants to use an MVP - stop using that mindset. Literally no one other than your Mum/Dad will use a "minimum" "viable" thing you build. Its 2020, the whole patchy product cycle doesn't exist. Aim for Simple, Loveable and Complete (or what I call Minimal Product for Impact) Introduce simple features that meet your north star and make sure they're complete.</p><p><strong>Cold Email</strong><br>Learn to master this, its a great skillset to have in building a company and distributing content.</p><p><strong>Feature Validation</strong><br>Before you build a feature, literally build a simple landing page, run some GAds to it for lifetime deals (this doesn't work always, but for some apps).</p><p><strong>Communicate</strong><br>Build every channel possible to communicate with your user as often as possible for as long as possible.</p><p><strong>No CC No Bueno</strong><br>UNTIL someone gives you their CC, you don't have validation. Do not take anything else as validation other than their CC.</p><p><strong>Timeframe</strong><br>Before you start, set a goal to hit, if you don't hit that goal, be quick to reflect. Build more or move on Last but the MOST important.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong><br>Almost 90% of all the "Super successful" founders attributed having a previous built audience as their reason for success. They built this audience through, podcasts, blogs, Youtube, Tiktok or even Newsletters. BUILD. AN. AUDIENCE. You have a higher chance of succeeding with a shit product and a large audience than vice versa For those that are keen.</p><p>All the best peeps!</p></div><p>-Vaibhav<br></p><blockquote><em><strong>Vaibhav</strong></em> has built several startups into Million Dollar businesses serving Millions of customers across the globe via five2one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604884175281/Wd5pu-Bw3.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>In this mini-series, I will be taking you through how to use flexbox CSS, in a simple, easy to understand way. You can really empower your projects and websites with the use of flexbox CSS and reduce your lines of code drastically. I'll also be releasing a video-based tutorial series over on my <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/alanmontgomerycoding">YouTube</a> soon, so look out for that too. Ok... Let's get into it.</p>

<p>Flexbox CSS is a one dimensional layout model/method used for laying out items (HTML elements) in a row or column fashion (horizontal or vertical).</p>
<h2 id="why-flexbox-css">Why Flexbox CSS?</h2>
<p>Long gone are the days of using <code>float</code> and <code>position</code> in CSS to create layouts and responsive layouts. Utilising flexbox allows you to create fully <strong>responsive</strong>, mobile first layouts without needing to write lots of different media queries.</p>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2>
<p>The most important CSS property in flexbox is the <strong>display</strong> property. This is how we define a "flexbox container". Familiar display properties include <em>block</em>, <em>inline</em>, <em>inline-block</em> etc etc. Flex is no different, it can be defined like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {

    <span>display</span>: flex;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="container">Container</h2>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"container"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"item"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"item"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"item"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Our flex container is typically a block level element, usually like a div for example. Refer to the below image; I have defined a flex container and inside my flex container, I have three more divs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604881496142/fnYjCju9S.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Flexbox container / Flex container"></p>
<h2 id="items">Items</h2>
<p>These are called flex items. Each child inside a flex container is referred to as an "item". You can style these individually again, using flexbox CSS if wanted and we'll get into the specifics of this in the next part.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604881547911/oHOA4hd7z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Flexbox items / Flex items"></p>
<h2 id="flex-direction">Flex Direction</h2>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {

    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>:
}
</code></pre>
<p>The next important CSS property in terms of flexbox is the <code>flex-direction</code> property. This allows you to specify which direction you want to place the items inside the flex container. There are four values which can be used for the <code>flex-direction</code> property, either in a row or a column (<em>e.g. horizontally or vertically</em>).</p>
<h3 id="row">Row</h3>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {

    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>: row;
}
</code></pre>
<p>By default, a flex container will automatically have the flex direction of row. Items inside a row direction flex container will be displayed <em>left to right</em> (LTR), your first item will be the first placed element on the display.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604881578319/WinXtcAhZ.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Flex direction row"></p>
<h3 id="row-reverse">Row Reverse</h3>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {

    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>: row-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>row-reverse</code> value for <code>flex-direction</code> is similar to the <code>row</code> value, however the items inside a row-reverse direction flex container will be displayed <em>right to left</em> (RTL), so your first item will now become the last for example.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604881606985/r6yklzUvS.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Flex direction row-reverse"></p>
<h3 id="column-and-column-reverse">Column and Column Reverse</h3>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {

    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>: column | column-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The next type of <code>flex-direction</code> you can specify is in the vertical axis in the form of columns. First of all with the <code>column</code> value, similar to the <code>row</code> value but placed <em>top to bottom</em> (TTB). Alternatively you can use the <code>column-reverse</code> value which again, is similar to <code>row-reverse</code> but displayed <em>bottom to top</em> (BTT).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604881638561/5U3hUwFeJ.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Flex direction column and column reverse"></p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed part 1 of my easy to understand flexbox CSS tutorial. It really is that simple to get started using it. In the next part we'll look at some more specific properties we can use to <code>justify-content</code> to space out flex items inside our flex containers!</p>
<p>Please leave a comment and a reaction to this post if you enjoyed it! Also, I have a <strong>YouTube</strong> channel where I'm posting lots of coding tutorials, tips, tricks, reviews and more, would love to see you there:</p>

<p>See you in the next part!</p>

November 8, 2020 | https://menduz.com/posts/2020.11.08 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://menduz.com/posts/2020.11.08">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There is a very easy way to know know which Github user is associated with your SSH key.<!--more--> 
Executing <code>ssh -T <a href="https://menduz.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="90f7f9e4d0f7f9e4f8e5f2bef3fffd">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>, you will receive a greeting with your username.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❭ ssh <span>-T</span> <a href="https://menduz.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e1868895a1868895899483cf828e8c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
Hi menduz! Youve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To extract the username we can run <code>sed</code> over the response.</p>



<h2 id="importing-gpg-keys">Importing GPG keys</h2>

<p>I use my YubiKey to store both my GPG and SSH. But having the SSH working out of the box is way easier than GPG, the last requires the machine to know the public key before it can be used. And it can be either downloaded from a key server, plain .asc files, or like in my case: download it from my Github profile.</p>

<p>To do so, I leverage the <code>https://github.com/{username}.gpg</code> function.</p>

<p>Since we now know the username associated with the SSH in the YubiKey (the previous step), we can get the GPG keys like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❭ <span># this step may require you to touch the YubiKey</span>
❭ <span>username</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>ssh <span>-T</span> <a href="https://menduz.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="bed9d7cafed9d7cad6cbdc90ddd1d3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> 2&gt;&amp;1 | <span>sed</span> <span>'s/^Hi //'</span> | <span>sed</span> <span>'s/\! .*//'</span><span>)</span>
❭ curl <span>--silent</span> <span>"https://github.com/</span><span>${</span><span>username</span><span>}</span><span>.gpg"</span> | gpg <span>--import</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check it works running <code>gpg --card-status</code> and search for the email in the “General key info” section, it must match your GPG’s. If it doesn’t show up, make sure you are importing the same keys present in the card.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❭ gpg <span>--card-status</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>"General key info"</span>
General key info..: pub  ed25519/3ABC123401923E0A 2020-11-08 Agustin Mendez &lt;<a href="https://menduz.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d9a0b6acab99bcb4b8b0b5f7bab6b4">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-git">Setting up Git</h2>

<p>Now that we already have our GPG and SSH working, we must configure Git to use the GPG and the mail.</p>

<p>To do so, the email address from the GPG will be used (which is a requirement for Github).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span># Read email from the --card-status</span>
<span>CARD_MAIL</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>gpg <span>--card-status</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>-Po</span> <span>--color</span><span>=</span>never <span>"(?&lt;=&lt;).*(?=&gt;)"</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$?</span> <span>==</span> 0 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
  </span><span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; Using mail: </span><span>${</span><span>CARD_MAIL</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$?</span> <span>!=</span> 0 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; ! Cannot find CARD_NAME."</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; FAILED!"</span>
  <span>else

      git config <span>--global</span> commit.gpgsign <span>true
      </span>git config <span>--global</span> user.signingkey <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>KEY_ID</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
      <span># git config --global url."ssh://<a href="https://menduz.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="9afdf3eedafdf3eef2eff8b4f9f5f7">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"</span>

      <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; SUCCESS!"</span>
    <span>else
      </span><span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; ! Cannot find KEY_ID"</span>
      <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; FAILED!"</span>
    <span>fi
  fi
else
  </span><span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; ! No known yubikey was detected."</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; FAILED!"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Did you know you are sending your identities every time you connect to an ssh server?</p>

<p>Be careful to not leak your keys to every place you want to connect to.</p>

<p>To do so, create an identity for each site you want to connect to and add the following lines to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>IdentitiesOnly <span>yes

</span>Host github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_yubikey.pub
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the public key from your SSH in the YubiKey run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ssh-add <span>-L</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>"cardno"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa_yubikey.pub
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is part of my https://menduz.com/bootstrap.sh script, used every time I set up a new machine or when I think that my machine was somehow compromised.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><h3><a href="https://boredhacking.com/">Bored Hacking</a></h3></header><main><p>November 08, 2020<!-- --> | <b>4<!-- --> min read</b></p><div><p>Onboarding can be a very hectic and stressful time when you are starting a new job. New coworkers to meet, new codebases to learn, new languages to learn, new technologies, new processes, and the list can go on and on. Good onboarding materials and processes can go a long way when you’re first starting out. However, it shouldn’t just be a one way street. Onboarding should be a collaborative and incremental process that every new hire(and employee) actively contributes to. Things change from onboarding class to onboarding class, especially in a fast moving startup. It is therefore not only up to the existing members but also the new hires to contribute to the onboarding experience and documentation to keep it up to date and make it better overtime. Here are some recommendations for making onboarding not only productive for you but also better for future new hires.</p>
<h2>Take Your Time to Onboard</h2>
<p>Onboarding isn’t a race to the finish line. It can feel like you need to onboard as quickly as possible and be productive right away. However, you have to remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day and this time is important to build a good foundation for the rest of your time at the company. You don’t want to jump in before you’re ready and struggle to keep up. Take your time to properly onboard, and learn as much as you can during this time. Your team will be understanding that you are onboarding and shouldn’t feel like you need to be productive from day 1. Although there is generally a set time period for new hires to still be onboarding, the first month or two generally depending on your company. Take full advantage of your expected onboarding period. When you run into something you don’t know or haven’t seen before, take the time to really dig into it and learn it. Do your own research or ask teammates about it and make sure you fully understand it. Once again, this will pay off in the future and help you compound your knowledge as you continue to learn and work at the company.</p>
<h2>Write and Update Documentation</h2>
<p>As you are onboarding hopefully there is already some documentation on how to at the very least setup local development. Depending on your company, you may also have documentation on team specific information, common tasks, etc. Find out what your company uses to store documentation(Google Drive, Github, Notion, Confluence, Dropbox Paper, etc.) and look through it for even more documents. As you go through this documentation, if there’s anything that doesn’t make sense or is outdated make sure to update the documentation. And if you realize there isn’t any documentation for something you encountered then you should write it! Anything you do while onboarding that didn’t have clear directions or documentation, feel free to write it up yourself. Even once you are done onboarding, you should continue this. Every little improvement will benefit someone else down the road and make them productive quicker, multiplying your effect and increasing overall productivity.</p>
<h2>Take Notes During Onboarding</h2>
<p>Take notes of things that went well during your onboarding and things that could have gone better. These will be important for improving the situation for the next hire(s). Take these notes to your manager and talk through the good and bad. This will help the organization understand what they are doing well and what they can do to make it better for the next hire on your team. Your manager will want to make sure they are doing everything they can to help you onboard better and improve the situation for the future.</p>
<h2>Ask Questions</h2>
<p>Asking questions and getting good answers is incredibly important during onboarding. You may get blocked often while onboarding because there are a lot of unknowns and that’s okay. But don’t wait too long to unblock yourself. One big thing to remember is, you should never hesitate to reach out to someone because they seem too busy. They may be busy but they will normally make the time to help onboard new people. Although not all onboarding buddies may be okay with constant interruptions, it is reasonable that you should try and limit their context shifting. Therefore, setup time to talk with your onboarding buddy or teammate. Setting up time can help limit this but also ensure you get your questions answered. At first this should probably be a set time daily for the first week, but as you continue to onboard it can be less often.</p>
<h2>Good Onboarding and Helping Out New Hires is a 10X Situation</h2>
<p>The 10x engineer is often talked about in tech and seen as a unicorn of sorts. For those not familiar, it was commonly thought that a 10x engineer performed 10 times as efficiently as other engineers, performing the work of 10 engineers. However, I don’t think that a 10x engineer should only be more efficient but I think 10x engineers are engineers who help 10X the learning of other engineers as well. A 10x engineer helps their whole team be more efficient by teaching and mentoring them. This applies directly to onboarding and new hires. The faster new hires onboard the faster they can be productive. Spreading information to more people makes everyone better and creates a cycle of spreading information, which can lead not only to a 10x situation but a 100x situation where multiple people within your org are increasing their knowledge and productivity by 10x. The real “unicorn” engineers are the ones who lift up the whole organization or team, and onboarding is a key component of that. Everyone should realize the importance of a good onboarding period for new hires and how it can help the organization as a whole.</p></div><hr><ul><li><a rel="prev" href="https://boredhacking.com/starting-a-new-elixir-project/">Starting a new Elixir Project</a></li><li></li></ul></main></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="course-description"><a name="description"></a>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course is a second-year course for computer science majors. It is the primary data structures course in the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>’s <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/">computer science</a> curriculum. Unlike many other data structure courses at other institutions, it is intended as the <em>third</em> course in sequence, meaning that students are expected to have taken two semesters of Java (or equivalent, although some of the examples are specifically from Java). The course focuses on how programs and data are represented from the high level down to the low level. For programs, we examine (from high to low): abstract data types, Java code, C++ code, C code, assembly (x86) code, and a customized machine language. For data, we examine (also from high to low): abstract data types, objects, primitive types, and how numbers are encoded (both floats (IEEE 754) and integers (two’s complement)). About two-thirds of this course is programming using C++. The remainder of this course uses other languages, including (in decreasing order): x86 assembly, IBCM (a machine language), C, Objective C, and shell scripting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.abet.org/">ABET</a> course objects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy, operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter passing modes, arrays)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown"><a name="markdown"></a>Markdown</h2>
<p>The majority of the content in this repository was created using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Unfortunately, the only standardized Markdown is very old (2004), and has limited support for many HTML features, such as tables. A simple conversion script in a Makefile is in the <a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/utils/index.html">utils</a> (<a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/index.md">md</a>) directory, which uses <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. Assuming pandoc is installed, run <code>make markdown</code> in the root repo directory to re-create all the .html files from their associated .md files.</p>
<p>For all the Markdown files in this repository, both the original (.md) file and the HTML version (.html) are added to the repository, so that people who do not have Markdown installed can still view the contents of this repository.</p>
<p>Note that Github supports an enhanced version of Markdown, called <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Github Flavored Markdown</a>, or GFM. This mostly pertains to this README file. In an effort to ensure compatibility with other Markdown programs (such as the one described here and what reveal.js uses), GFM specific features are generally avoided. One example is the use of anchors in this document – the HTML tags are included instead of using GFM’s version.</p>
<h2 id="source-code"><a name="sourcecode"></a>Source code</h2>
<p>All source code is formatted via <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/">astyle</a> and then highlighted via <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html">source-highlight</a>. Both the original file (foo.cpp) and the highlighted version (foo.cpp.html) are included in the repository. All links to source code will like to the .html, with a “(<a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/README.md">src</a>)” after it to link to the original source code. Utility scripts are provided to convert all the files in the <a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/utils/index.html">utils</a> (<a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/index.md">md</a>) directory. <code>make format</code> and <code>make highlight</code> can also be run to invoke the scripts.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>I wanted to share my journey from start to finish to restore a 1983 IBM Model F XT mechanical keyboard to it's former glory.  It includes the steps, mistakes, and additional hardware required to make it functional with a modern computer.  This blog post is dedicated to my dad for teaching me about computers.</p>
<p><img alt="original.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/original.jpg"></p>

<p>A few months ago, my dad asked if I was interested in taking ownership of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">IBM model 5150 PC</a>.  Without hesitation, I said "yes!".  The first project I wanted to tackle was to restore the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_F_keyboard">1983 Model F XT mechanical keyboard</a> keyboard.  In a sentimental and
journeyman/apprentice-sense, it felt like my dad was passing on the tools of his craft to continue the family line of
computer work and I couldn't pass that up.</p>
<p><img alt="datestamp.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/datestamp.jpg"></p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the IBM Model F, <a href="https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/">modelfkeyboards.com</a> summarizes it
nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IBM Model F keyboards not only used the best switches, the materials used in their production (well over 5lbs of
steel and other metals) means they will be working as good as new when it’s time to pass it on to your grandchildren.
The problem...they just aren't made that way any more.  The IBM Model F was discontinued in the 1980's.  If you do
find a Model F, it will be some combination of dirty, broken and/or expensive, requiring hours of work to get it
working again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tank of a keyboard weighs in at over 6 pounds, sounds like <a href="https://youtu.be/XTVeSCqYSmE?t=7">this</a>, and at the
time of production, retailed for $300-400 in 1982 ($800-1000 dollars adjusted in today's dollars!) according to this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Jds326gks">review</a>.</p>
<p>The restoration did take a few hours and fortunately none of it involved a soldering iron or replacing any of the
electrical or physical components because it was already in great functioning shape...a true testament to the design.
Even cooler, this blog post was typed up using the restored Model F keyboard!</p>

<p>Before beginning the project, I discovered <a href="https://www.clickykeyboards.com/">ClickyKeyboards</a>, a site "Specializing in
the restoration and collection of model M keyboards", the successor to the Model F.  On ClickyKeyboards, there is a
section dedicated to the adapters and converters that may be required to make older 5-pin DIN plug keyboards compatible
with modern USB ports.  One of the companies mentioned on ClickyKeyboards is
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/">Hagstrom Electronics</a>, which sells keyboard encoders and protocol converters.
Without looking too closely at the other products, I quickly purchased the
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/keyboard-encoder-ke18-xtat-ps2-shp.html">KE18-XTAT-PS/2</a> which "converts an XT
keyboard into a PS/2 protocol keyboard" for $55.  I was ecstatic that there was at least something to get me into PS/2
land, because at that point I knew I could easily find a PS/2 to USB converter.</p>
<p>After the KE18-XTAT-PS/2 arrived, I quickly fired up an ancient box (yes, that is Windows 2000!) with a PS/2 input on
the motherboard.  I tested all the keys to ensure they still worked and they did!  With confirmation that the keyboard
still worked, it was time to start the restoration.</p>
<p><img alt="win2000.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/win2000.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="original2.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/original2.jpg"></p>
<p>The first step was to remove the metal casing and see what the state of the board was underneath the keys.  There was
years worth of debris, coffee stains, and gunk that had to be removed.  In addition, there were a few spots with
corrosion on the board that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p><img alt="preclean.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/preclean.jpg"></p>
<p>Once the casing was off, I utilized compressed air to clean out the key bunkers and get rid of any loose nastiness.
Next, I tried using rubbing alcohol and Q-tips to try and remove some of the stickier stuff, but that didn't
really work.</p>

<p>I borrowed a rotary tool to buff out the corrosion.  I used one of the provided bits that had soft plastic tentacles to
try and buff out the corroded spots as gently as possible.  There are likely better and more appropriate bits, but it
did the job.  The rotary tool's power and RPMs were a bit overkill even on the lowest setting.  Ideally, I would have
used one with fewer minimum RPMs and a more precise bit to get all the spots.</p>
<p><img alt="buffing_tool_and_bit.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/buffing_tool_and_bit.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="bit.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/bit.jpg"></p>
<p>I was using the rotary tool under a bright overhead desk lamp, and with the way the light was reflecting, I didn't
notice it was taking off the black finish and revealing the silver metal base.  At that point, I just decided to buff
off the finish where I could to make it look more uniform.  The silver metal is visible when the keys and cover are back
on it, but it looks fine.  Unfortunately, with the rotary head and bit size, I wasn't able to buff every last square
inch of the board, but I knew it'd be covered so I wasn't too concerned with it looking perfect.</p>
<p><img alt="allbuffed.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/allbuffed.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="postbuffing.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/postbuffing.jpg"></p>
<p>There was still some residue stuck to the board that I wanted to remove.  I started out using a small eye glass
screwdriver to scrape it off, but it took some of the black finish off as well and didn't look that nice.  At that point,
a chemical pivot was required and I reached for the <a href="https://googone.com/">Goo Gone</a>, which I should have done from the
beginning.  The Goo Gone and a bit of elbow grease with Q-Tips did the trick in removing the stubborn gunk on the board.</p>
<p><img alt="postgoogone.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/postgoogone.jpg"></p>

<p>With the board in good shape, it was time to tackle the actual keys.  I first gave them a good wipe-down using desk
cleaning wipes, which removed most of the discoloration and stains.  However, they still didn't look as good as they
could, and I read that just soaking them in a bowl of dish soap and water for a few hours can do wonders...and it did.
They keys look brand new.</p>
<p><img alt="keybath.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/keybath.jpg"></p>
<p>One mistake I made after washing them was to not let them completely dry on the inside.  I placed the keys back on the
board too soon, and some water leaked onto a few of the springs causing a small amount of rusting (slightly visible in
the post-Goo Gone image).  I gave them another soap soak and used the compressed air to really get out the water.  I
also let them air dry for 1-2 days before putting them back on the board.</p>

<p>After successfully testing the actual keyboard and the restoration almost complete, it was time to search for a PS/2 to
USB cable.  On a whim, I was back on the Hagstrom Electronic site and noticed they already had a small box, the
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/ke-xtusb-keyboard-encoder-shp.html">KE-XTUSB</a>, that converted the XT signal to USB,
and it was the same price.  They graciously allowed me to return the KE18-XTAT-PS/2 in exchange for the KE-XTUSB which
was the same price.  A few days later the KE-XTUSB arrived in the mail and I eagerly connected it to my current computer.</p>
<p><img alt="xtusb.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/xtusb.jpg"></p>

<p>Everything worked beautifully except for two keys.  The "s" key's spring mechanism would either not detect a key press
or would be stuck in the depressed state blasting "sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss" across the screen.  With a
bit of finagling, I got the key cap placed correctly so now it works like a champ.  The other key that has issues is the
accountant's "+" near the 10 key pad.  The spring had come off somehow and I super glued it back, but something still
isn't right and it fails to register key strokes.  Not a huge loss since "+" can be achieved with another key
combination.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really impressed with how it looks and, when comparing it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2bAhxK76hc">this</a>
unboxing video of a never before opened Model F, it looks about the same!</p>

<p><strong>Dan R. K. Ports</strong> - Panelist</p>

<p>I am a researcher in the Systems Research Group at Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>My research focuses on distributed systems – using a combination of new algorithms and systems techniques to build practical systems that are faster, more reliable, easier to program, and more secure.</p>

<p>I take a broad view of the systems field: besides distributed systems, I've worked in operating systems, networking, databases, architecture, and security. I believe that looking across the entire systems stack yields interesting opportunities at the intersection of these areas.</p>

<p>Most of my work these days involves rethinking how distributed systems should be built for the datacenter environment. I lead the Prometheus project at MSR, which asks how we can use new reconfigurable devices, such as programmable dataplane switches and smart NICs, to support advanced systems applications. The key idea is to co-design distributed systems with new network primitives.</p>

<p>Before joining MSR, I was on the faculty in CSE at the University of Washington. I still advise a few excellent students over there.
An increasingly long time ago (i.e., 2012), I was a student at MIT, where I was (approximately) Barbara Liskov's last Ph.D. graduate. Even before that, I was an undergraduate at MIT.</p>

And the key to its efficiency is the core. The core is a continuous strip of grain oriented silicon steel, wound like a clock spring, under tension. It is annealed to relax the molecular structure which ensures that all grains are in the magnetic direction (unlike the old standard EI, with about 40% in the wrong direction).</p> <p>There is no air gap, resulting in a stacking factor of 97.5% of its weight. Since all the windings are symmetrically spread over the entire round, gapless core, a higher flux density is possible (toroidal transformers operate at flux densities of 16 to 18 kilogauss, while traditional EI transformers operate at 12 to 14 kilogauss).</p> <p>The magnetic flux is in the same direction as the grain oriented silicon steel core, thus achieving very high electrical efficiencies. Typical efficiency figures for toroidal transformers are 95% (e.g. 18kVA at 98% efficiency).</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div><h4>Low Mechanical Hum</h4> <div id="attachment_3318"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3318" loading="lazy" src="https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lowmechhum-300x186.jpg" alt="Lowmechhum" width="300" height="186" srcset="https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lowmechhum-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lowmechhum.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3318">Compared to EI transformers, toroids are silent.</p></div> <p>Toroidal transformers are also acoustically quieter than EI transformers. The absence of an air gap typically provides an 8:1 reduction of acoustic noise. In addition the windings tightly envelope the entire core, effectively reducing magnetostriction – the main source of the familiar mechanical hum found in standard vertically laminated EI transformers. Compared to EI transformers, toroids are silent.</p></div> </div> <div> <div><h4>Small Size – Saves Real Estate</h4> <div id="attachment_3319"><p><a href="https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smallsize.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3319" loading="lazy" src="https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smallsize-300x186.jpg" alt="Smallsize" width="300" height="186" srcset="https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smallsize-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smallsize.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3319">Toroids are smaller and lighter than standard transformers.</p></div> <p>This efficiency yields the most easily identifiable feature of the toroid, its size benefit.

This can translate into big savings in large transformer applications such as industrial controls.</p></div> </div> <div> <div><h4>Low Stray Magnetic Fields</h4> <div id="attachment_3317"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3317" loading="lazy" src="https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lowmagfield-300x186.jpg" alt="Lowmagfield" width="300" height="186" srcset="https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lowmagfield-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.toruspower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lowmagfield.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3317">Toroidal transformers radiate about 1/10 the magnetic field of EI transformers.</p></div> <p>Another type of noise is magnetic.

    <p>About three months ago I unconsciously or perhaps consciously lost interest in ham radio. This isn’t the first time this has happened to me, in fact this was what lead me to allow my license to lapse the first time in 2016. If it weren’t for a new coworker of mine showing interest in ham radio again after a twenty-five year absent; I presumably wouldn’t be writing this post now. His excitement about all of the recent advances that have been made since he was first license reminded me of the things I missed about ham radio. This forced me to reflect on the reasons that I stepped away from the hobby for nearly three months. After some time I narrowed it down to three primary reasons. Without further ado I present to you my three reasons I took a break from ham radio.</p>
<h2 id="1-2020-amsat-board-of-directors-election">1. 2020 AMSAT Board of Directors Election</h2>
<p>I love satellite operations! It was my primary reason for returning to the hobby earlier this year. Shortly after becoming licensed I joined AMSAT to support amateur radio in space. Little did I know there was an ongoing dispute among two newly elected board members and the rest of the board of directors. Apparently the dispute was over the access of to AMSAT’s finical records with the lengthy ordeal playing out like some pollical scandal with lawyers and secret audio recordings. The board of directors went as far as <a href="https://www.amsat.org/amsat-leadership-explains-2018-2020-legal-expenses/">releasing a statement</a> that was full of contempt for the two new directors. In turn Patrick Stoddard WD9EWK, one of the individuals at that center of this controversy <a href="http://amsat.wd9ewk.net/">released his own statement</a> on the events that transpired. All of this drama culminated with those who sided with Mr. Stoddard attempting replace three of the existing board members with there of their own candidates. Ultimately they were unsuccessful in their coup attempt, and I’ve exhausted all interest in being a part of AMSAT.</p>

<h2 id="2-limited-radio-budget--limited-operating-options">2. Limited Radio Budget = Limited Operating Options</h2>
<p>Whether you want to admit it or not, ham radio is an expensive hobby. Sure you can purchase a Baofeng handheld for thirty-five dollars, but to really take advantage of all your license privileges you need to shell out some cold hard cash for either an HF rig or an all mode VHF/UHF radio. Initially, I wanted to get on the air as quickly and cheaply as possible to try my hand at working a few of the FM satellites, as a result I purchased an Arrow Antenna II and the Wouxun KG-UV8D Plus. To make a long story short, the Wouxun radio was garbage. Don’t believe me <a href="https://www.kj7nzl.net/blog/wouxun-kg-uv8d-plus-fm-satellites/">check out my review of the Wouxun KG-UV8D Plus</a>. After some time of fooling around with that dumb thing, I decided to purchase a Yaesu FT3D and I’m glad I did. On a side note, I should absolutely do a review of that thing since I’ve had it for about three months now and I’ve explored most everything the radio has to offer. With the KG-UV8D I was limited in how I could operate. With just supporting FM I really only could use the thing for satellites outside of using it to connect to any of the local repeaters in the area. On the other hand the Yaesu FT3D allowed me the ability to expore APRS and C4FM AKA System Fussion. This however came at the cost of three times the price of the KG-UV8D. All told, even after selling my KG-UV8D, I am about $600 into the hobby with an Arrow Antenna II, Yaesu FT3D, and Comet Dual Band HT antenna. Even with this setup I’m only able play around with FM satellites, APRS, and simplex/repeaters. I would have loved exploring some of the other areas of the hobby when I jumped back in the spring of this year, but discretionary funds were spread out among different things at the time.</p>

<h2 id="3-life-just-got-in-the-way">3. Life Just Got in the Way</h2>
<p>This year 2020 has been an unusual year for me. Between a global pandemic and finishing some of my basement, I’ve been very busy. As a result I’ve had little free time. What free time I’ve possessed has been divided between multiple hobbies with amateur radio taking a back seat most of the time. It’s my own fault really since I set out earlier this year with the goal of exclusively working FM satellites. I initial assumed it would be effortless to make time through out my day for a quick ten to fifteen minute pass. It made sense at the time; take a brief break, make a couple of contacts, and back to what I was doing before hand. But it turns out that FM satellite QSOs are hard work This in turn lead me to get frustrated very quickly and wish I could operate at my own pace whenever I felt like it. Just so you know, rarely do two FM satellite passes line up back to back when you want them two giving you a thirty to forty minute window of time in which to have fun. Looking back on my journey into ham radio, both the first time and second time, I should have just gone the HF route from the get go. Since I didn’t, I feel like I set myself up for disappointment. With very little motivation and other competing priorities it’s no wonder why I stepped away from ham radio as long I did.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>
<p>So what does the future hold for me now that I’m interested in ham radio again? Well, Santa is coming to town, and he’s going to have a new Yaesu FTDX 3000 wrapped up under three for me. I’ll finally be able to dive head first into the world of HF. I have some ambitious plans too. I’d like to explore some of the lesser used digital modes like Hellschreiber, Olivia, and Contestia. I’ll still jump on the FT8 bandwagon, but ultimately I want to explore all the digital modes. I also want to <a href="https://www.kj7nzl.net/blog/learning-morse-code-series/">learn morse code</a>, which I’ve unsuccessfully started and begin working som CW. The Yaesu FTDX 3000 contains some exceptionally attractive features for CW operations that I really want to take advantage of. Another area that I’m going to focus on coming up soon will be building a MMDVM hotspot. Sure I could merely purchase a prebuilt one, but what the fun in that? All in all I think the rest of this year and next year is shaping up to be a excellent time for me to get back into ham radio.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Last month VMWare released what they have called <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/10/announcing-the-esxi-arm-fling.html">ESXi Arm-fling.</a> This new release allows you to install the same ESXi you know and love on an ARM processor. VMWare has certified a few systems for datacenter use. They also have certified it for the Raspberry Pi 4, but only for what they call “Far Edge”.</p>
<p>Today we are going to perform the installation on a Raspberry Pi 8GB and do some testing. While we generally feel <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/">ProjectTinyMiniMicro</a> may be a better option for some, there are many enthusiasts who sing the praises of the Raspberry Pi. The Pi has exceptional power efficiency, scalability, and a small footprint.<span id="more-48249"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_48251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48251"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-800x670.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4" width="696" height="583" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-800x670.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-358x300.jpg 358w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-696x583.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1-502x420.jpg 502w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201107_151215-1.jpg 1014w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48251">Raspberry Pi 4 CanaKit and a LovePI PoE HAT</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before we continue, it is worth noting that this installation is a little bit different than other Raspberry Pi installations. We will need a total of <strong>three</strong> different pieces of storage to complete this installation. You need a microSD card for the firmware, but in this guide that is ALL the microSD card will be used for. Then you will need a USB thumb drive to act as your VMWare installer. Finally, you will need a place to install VMWare to. While it is possible to install it to your microSD card, that is not officially supported. Instead, you want to look at a USB based solution or a network solution such as PXE or iSCSI.</p>
<h2>Preparing our Pi for ESXi</h2>
<p>You will need to grab the<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/"> NOOBS </a>image and&nbsp;burn it to your microSD card if you did not buy a kit with it preinstalled as we had. To do so you can utilize the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>.</p>
<p>When the NOOBs installer boots up, select the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) option. You do not need the full desktop version. We are only using the OS to update the EEPROM and get some other updates out of the way.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48252"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-800x501.png" alt="N" width="696" height="436" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-800x501.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-400x251.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-696x436.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-670x420.png 670w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS.png 921w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48252">NOOBS Selecting Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the installation is completed, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a
sudo reboot</code></pre>
<p>After you have completed the EEPROM update, we need to now update the firmware and switch to the community UEFI firmware. First, start by going to the Raspberry Pi <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware">Github page</a> and download the latest firmware. Next, go to pftf’s UEFI <a href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi4">Github page</a>, and download it as well.</p>
<p>Safely shutdown your Pi and take the microSD card out. Next, plug your microSD card into a computer and prepare to update the files on it. To get started, we need to format the RECOVERY partition and rename it UEFI:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48259"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format.png" alt="Format" width="251" height="460" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format.png 251w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format-164x300.png 164w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format-229x420.png 229w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48259">SD CARD Format for UEFI</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, drag and drop the new files from the <strong>boot folder in the firmware-master</strong> onto the <strong>SD card</strong>. Start by going to the firmware-master folder and selecting everything. Once completed, you must remove the four files starting with the name “kernel”:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48260"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel.png" alt="Kernel" width="605" height="87" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel.png 605w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel-400x58.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48260">VMware ESXi Raspberry Pi Kernel in firmware-master</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, do the same thing for the files from the <strong>UEFI firmware</strong>. Make sure you <strong>replace/overwrite</strong>&nbsp;the files with the updated ones.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48255" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48255"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-800x347.png" alt="UEFI" width="696" height="302" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-800x347.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-400x173.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-1536x666.png 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-696x302.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-1068x463.png 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-969x420.png 969w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI.png 1829w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48255">VMware ESXi Raspberry Pi UEFI Setup</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, open the config.txt file in the UEFI drive. We need to modify it by adding a line</p>
<pre><code>gpu_mem=32</code></pre>
<p>You can now put the SD card back into your RPI.</p>
<h2>Setting up ESXi for ARM</h2>
<p>To get started you will need to navigate to <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/esxi-arm-edition#summary">VMware’s page</a> for ESXi for ARM. Once there you will need to create an account and download the ISO. You will need to burn this ISO to a separate USB thumb drive. To burn it to the drive, you can utilize <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48258" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48258"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi.png" alt="Esxi" width="352" height="485" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi.png 419w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi-218x300.png 218w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi-305x420.png 305w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48258">Rufus Esxi for Raspberry Pi</figcaption></figure>
<p>After you have burned the ISO to your thumb drive, you need to plug it into your Pi and turn it on. You will see a new UEFI boot menu, press escape, and get into the UEFI to make any changes.</p>
<p>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager&nbsp;</strong>and then click <strong>Limit Ram to 3GB</strong> and change it to <strong>Disabled</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48262"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-800x557.png" alt="Unlimited RAM" width="696" height="485" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-800x557.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-400x279.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-696x485.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-603x420.png 603w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM-100x70.png 100w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Unlimited-RAM.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48262">Unlimited RAM</figcaption></figure>
<p>Press <strong>F10</strong> and save the change you made. Exit the UEFI and press <strong>Enter</strong> to boot to the USB drive. The system will then boot into the ESXi installer. One option for installing ESXi to an SSD, using something like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-SATA-USB-Cable-USB3S2SAT3CB/dp/B00HJZJI84/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=usb+to+sata+startech&amp;qid=1604788276&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySDJEUE9JUUgxQzlQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTM2MTQ1RDA0VFA3V0lJUUZYJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MzMzOTgzUzAwNTNCQkxWSk9XJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">Startech USB3.0 to SATA adapter</a>. Another option is to install it to another USB thumb drive and use iSCSI storage for your VMs.</p>

<p>Select your disk, it has to be one other than the USB installer drive or the microSD card. Once you have selected your disk, the installer will format it and destructively remove all data. You need only to assign a password and installation will begin. When you are done, simply remove the installation media and reboot.</p>
<h2>Getting Started in VMware ESXi on the Pi</h2>
<p>To get started, open a web browser on another computer and point it to the IP of your Pi. Once there, you should see the familiar ESXi home page. For more information on setting up ESXi, please see our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/building-a-lab-part-3-configuring-vmware-esxi-and-truenas-core/">Building a Lab series</a>.</p>

<p>The first step we should do is to add our NTP servers. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Manage&nbsp;</strong>then to <strong>System</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and finally to <strong>Time and Date. </strong>Add some NTP servers, then click on&nbsp;<strong>Services&nbsp;</strong>and start the <strong>ntpd</strong> service.</p>

<p>If you wanted to add iSCSI storage you can. For my testing, I added a 1TiB iSCSI LUN from my production TrueNAS Core box.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48267"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iscsi-800x256.png" alt="Iscsi" width="696" height="223" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iscsi-800x256.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iscsi-400x128.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iscsi-696x223.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iscsi-1068x342.png 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iscsi.png 1281w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48267">VMware ESXi on Arm Fling iSCSI</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, you can add it to a vCenter just like a normal ESXi host. You simply right-click on a datacenter, press <strong>A</strong><strong>dd Host,&nbsp;</strong>type your IP address, credentials and select a license.</p>

<p>At this point, you are basically ready to get going with the VMware ESXi on Arm Fling using your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h2>A Word on Some Limitations</h2>
<p>There are some limitations to this setup, however. As one example, ESXi on Arm cannot run X86 compatible operating systems. As a result, you will not be able to install Windows in the traditional sense. At this time Windows 10 for ARM is not supported. You will be able to install operating systems compiled for Arm, however. As a result, we see Ubuntu Server being a more popular guest OS than Windows Server.</p>
<p>Using ESXi on a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with something like Kubernetes makes for an interesting solution, however. This gives us tinkerers the ability to build an entire three node cluster on a single Raspberry Pi. While I certainly would not suggest doing this in production, it is a fantastic opportunity for learning and development.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>As Patrick stated in his piece <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/of-bbq-and-virtualization-large-nodes/">of BBQ and Virtualization</a>, large nodes make sense. With the advent of ESXi on Arm, we get to look at the other side of that picture. If you need a highly available solution for a lightweight application, you can use a cluster of Raspberry Pis to build a vSAN capable of obtaining that goal. Alternatively, if you are new to this world and just trying to learn, having ESXi available gives you access to what is used in the enterprise.</p>
<p>One of the coolest possibilities for this platform is for the Raspberry Pi to become a witness node for a cluster in vCenter. If you have two production x86 servers and are planning to build a vSAN, a RaspberryPi can be added as a witness node. This will effectively save you a ton of money by not having to buy a full-blown third server. Using a small node like this in the future can lower both up-front as well as operating costs over time due to the low power consumption. A note of warning, however. That is not an officially supported topology by VMWare, but it is certainly interesting! For those using other virtualization setups such as standard KVM on Linux clusters, this is a great use case as well.</p>

<p>With Apple switching to Arm, NVIDIA looking to <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-in-major-shift/">acquire</a> Arm, and <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/an-arm-opportunity-with-cloud-service-providers/2/">Cloud Providers</a> looking more at Arm, VMWare has made a strong move here. To be clear, it needed to do this as it was falling behind in the edge. Likewise, VMware is many years behind Amazon AWS in the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer/">DPU</a> architecture but is catching up with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-project-monterey-esxi-on-arm-on-dpu/">VMware Project Monterey ESXi on Arm on DPU</a>. It may be harder to buy a DPU today to work with ESXi on Arm, but it is relatively low-cost to simply get a Raspberry Pi. I am personally excited to see what happens next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>In this short tutorial, you will learn how to use loops more effectively in different situations.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Looping over two lists at the same time</span><p>

<span>There are some moments in coding, where you would be required to <span>iterate/loop over two lists</span> or sequences at the <span>same time.</span></span></p></h3>

<p><span>This can be achieved using the <code>zip()</code> function.</span></p>

<pre><code>colors = ["red", "blue", "white"]
types = ["warm", "cool", "neutral"]

for c, t in zip(colors, types):
    print(c + " is " + t)</code></pre>

<p><span><strong>Program Output:</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>red is warm
blue is cool
white is neutral</code></pre>





<h3><span>The <span>enumerate()</span> function.</span></h3>

<p><span>When looping through a sequence (lists, tuple, string, etc), the <span>position index</span> and <span>corresponding value </span>can be retrieved at the <span>same time</span> using the <code>enumerate()</code> function.</span></p>

<pre><code>colors = ["orange", "brown", "indigo", "black"]

for i, v in enumerate(colors):
    print(i , v)</code></pre>

<p><span><strong>Program Output:</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>0 orange
1 brown
2 indigo
3 black</code></pre>



<p><span>The <code>enumerate()</code> function returns individual elements in the list with their <span>indexes</span>.</span></p>





<h3><span>Looping through a dictionary with the<span> items()</span> method</span><span>.</span><br>
&nbsp;</h3>

<p><span>We can get both the keys and the corresponding values when looping over a dictionary by using the <code>items()</code> method.</span></p>

<pre><code>grades = {'Ana': 'B', 'John':'A+', 'Denise':"A", "katy": 'A'}

for name, g in grades.items():
    print(name + " had " + g)</code></pre>

<p><span><strong>Program Output:</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>Ana had B
John had A+
Denise had A
katy had A</code></pre>





<h3><span>Reverse looping.</span><br>
&nbsp;</h3>

<p><span>To loop over a range of numbers in reverse, first, specify the range and then call the <code>reversed()</code> function.</span></p>

<pre><code>for r in reversed(range(7)):
    print(r)</code></pre>

<p><span><strong>Program Output:</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>6
5
4
3
2
1
0</code></pre>



<p><em><span>The same analogy applies to looping over a list in reverse:</span></em></p>

<pre><code>colors = ["blue", "red", "black", "yellow"]

for i in reversed(colors):
    print(i)</code></pre>

<p><span><strong>Program Output:</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>yellow
black
red
blue</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/">blog</a> | <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">oilshell.org</a></p>

<p>
  2020-11-08
</p>
<p>The recent <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.3/">0.8.3</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/">0.8.4</a> releases were
so big that it's taking <strong>five blog posts</strong> to describe them!</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/big-changes.html">Big Changes to the Oil Language</a>: I published this
post about the expression language a couple weeks ago.</li>
<li><em>More Changes to Oil's Syntax</em>.  <strong>This post</strong> describes more syntactic
changes, including enhancements to shell builtins.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/11/proposed-syntax.html">Proposed Changes to Oil's Syntax</a>.  New constructs I
left syntactic space for.  We cleaned up a lot, but there are still more
warts in shell.</li>
<li><em>Changes to Oil's Semantics</em>.  I overhauled shell options, variable scope, and
<code>proc</code>.</li>
<li><em>The Shell Programmer's Guide to <code>errexit</code></em>.  About error handling in shell
and Oil.</li>
</ol>
<p>(And that doesn't count <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/11/metrics.html">yesterday's metrics post</a>, which isn't
essential.)</p>
<p>A quick story that motivates these changes: A few months ago, I wrote the first
draft of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.  That
led to more TODOs than expected, and to more docs, like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/doc/shell-idioms.html">Shell Language
Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been knocking off the TODOs.  So we're basically doing
<strong>documentation-driven development</strong>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to <strong>get feedback</strong> about the Oil language.  That
said, I also want to spend time on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/doc/">official
documentation</a>, so I may breeze through this quickly.
Please send feedback <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jqj86j/more_changes_to_oils_syntax/?">in the comments</a>, on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=Zulip#Zulip">Zulip</a>, or
on Github.</p>
 
<a name="special-variables-and-functions-_status-_match"></a>
<h2>Special Variables and Functions: <code>_status</code>, <code>_match()</code></h2>
<p>Shell has special variables like <code>$?</code> and <code>${BASH_REMATCH[@]}</code>.  They are
<strong>implicitly mutated</strong> by the interpreter.</p>
<p>Oil supports them, but I decided that we need a more consistent style with less
punctuation and CAPS.</p>
<p>A <strong>leading underscore</strong> gives these variables their own namespace, and lower
case makes them easier to type.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related to <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html#reliable-error-handling">the errexit
overhaul</a>:
<ul>
<li><code>_status</code> is a synonym for <code>$?</code>, and it's useful in expression mode.</li>
<li><code>@_pipeline_status</code> and <code>@_process_sub_status</code> for the result of process
concurrency constructs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regex API:
<ul>
<li><code>_match()</code> is now implemented.  The call <code>_match(x)</code> is like <code>m.group(x)</code>
in Python, except it's not a method on a match object.</li>
<li><code>_start()</code> and <code>_end()</code> are planned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design decision: If we ever get <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=awk#awk">Awk</a>-like functionality,
<ul>
<li>We'll use  <code>_line</code>, <code>_field(1)</code>, and <code>_filename</code> ...</li>
<li>Instead of <code>$0</code>, <code>$1</code>, and <code>FILENAME</code></li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QTSV#QTSV">QTSV</a> columns can also be named, eliminating the need for
<code>_field()</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="stricter-syntax"></a>
<h2>Stricter Syntax</h2>
<a name="enforced-parse_backslash-in-unquoted-words"></a>
<h3>Enforced <code>parse_backslash</code> in Unquoted Words</h3>
<p>This is like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/big-changes.html#tightened-up-string-literals">string literal
changes</a> mentioned in the
last post.</p>
<p>See these nice tables!  <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/860">https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/860</a></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil only has <strong>two meanings</strong> of <code>\n</code>: it's either a newline, or literally
<code>\n</code>, depending on the quotes.</li>
<li>Shell actually has <strong>three</strong>, as <code>echo \n</code> prints just <code>n</code>!  This is now
disallowed in Oil: use <code>echo n</code> or <code>echo \\n</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<a name="syntax-error-for-seq-3trailing"></a>
<h3>Syntax Error For <code>@(seq 3)trailing</code></h3>
<p>All constructs beginning with a <code>@</code> sigil must occupy a whole word.  There's no
implicit joining as with bash:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>echo x"$@"y </span>  
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>@</code> constructs are:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>echo @myarray</span>
<span>$</span> <span>echo @(split command sub)</span>
<span>$</span> <span>echo @array_func(x, y) @glob(pat) @split(s)</span>
</code></pre>
<a name="keywords-and-operators"></a>
<h2>Keywords and Operators</h2>
<a name="the-and-_-pseudo-assignment-keywords"></a>
<h3>The <code>=</code> and <code>_</code> "Pseudo-Assignment" Keywords</h3>
<p>This was done in a previous release, but deserves mention here.  Shell
assignments take expressions on the RHS:</p>
<pre><code>var x = 42 + f(x)
</code></pre>
<p>You can pretty-print an expression like this, which is useful in the REPL:</p>
<pre><code>= 42 + f(x)    
</code></pre>
<p>You can also <strong>ignore</strong> the result of an expression:</p>
<pre><code>_ 42 + f(x)    
_ = 42 + f(x)  
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful for functions with side effects:</p>
<pre><code>_ mylist.append(x)
_ mylist.extend(['str', var])
</code></pre>
<p>However we also have a shell style:</p>
<pre><code>push :mylist str $var
</code></pre>
<p>I don't expect <code>_</code> to be used that often in real code.  Functions usually
return values and are used like <code>echo $len(x)</code>.</p>
<a name="removed-pass-based-on-your-feedback"></a>
<h3>Removed <code>pass</code> Based On Your Feedback</h3>
<p>The <code>pass</code> keyword was intended for left-to-right function calls as in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dplyr#dplyr">dplyr</a>.</p>
<p>However, many people mentioned that it conflicted with existing programs.  And
we can use the <code>_</code> keyword instead.</p>
<p>So I removed it.  I listened to your feedback!</p>
<a name="the-operator-for-approximate-equality"></a>
<h3>The <code>~==</code> Operator for Approximate Equality</h3>
<p>Oil has typed data, so this operator will help us be as convenient as <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=awk#awk">Awk</a>,
while avoiding the pitfalls of JavaScript's <code>==</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var mystr = '42'  

if (x == 42) {    
  echo 'yes'    
}

if (x ~== 42) {   
  echo 'yes'
}
</code></pre>
<p>We might also use this operator for approximate floating point comparisons.  I
could use help on this!</p>
<a name="doc-comments-like-are-now-recognized"></a>
<h3>Doc Comments Like <code>###</code> Are Now Recognized</h3>
<p>The parser now recognizes doc comments and attached them to the AST.  It's the
first line after an opening <code>{</code> with <code>###</code>.</p>
<pre><code>proc restart(pid) {
   

   kill $pid
}
</code></pre>
<p>It also works for shell-style functions:</p>
<pre><code>f() {
   

   kill $1
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can use this for autocompletion and more.  Feedback is welcome.</p>
<a name="many-builtin-commands-enhanced"></a>
<h2>Many Builtin Commands Enhanced</h2>
<a name="repr-renamed-to-pp-pretty-print"></a>
<h3><code>repr</code> Renamed to <code>pp</code> (pretty print)</h3>
<p>(1) <code>pp cell</code> pretty-prints cells, which are the locations of variables.</p>
<p>Cells have flags like <code>-x</code> (export).  This builtin is very useful for debugging
shell programs!</p>
<pre><code><span>osh$</span> <span>export FOO=bar</span>
<span>osh$</span> <span>pp cell FOO</span>
FOO = (cell exported:T readonly:F nameref:F val:(value.Str s:bar))
</code></pre>
<p>(This format isn't stable yet.  See <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/817">issue 817</a>).</p>
<p>(2) <code>pp proc</code> shows doc comments.  It prints a table, which means it's the
first usage of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QTSV#QTSV">QTSV</a> in Oil!</p>
<pre><code><span>osh$</span> <span>pp proc</span>
proc_name       doc_comment
f       'doc \' comment with " quotes'
g       ''
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need a <code>QTSV_PAGER</code>, i.e. something like <code>less</code> for tables.  <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zvallq/pretty_csv_viewing_on_command_line">I recently
learned</a> that we
can do a quick and dirty job with <code>column</code>.</p>
<a name="added-long-flags-shopt-set-test-dir"></a>
<h3>Added Long Flags: <code>shopt --set</code>, <code>test --dir</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>We now have <code>shopt --set</code> and <code>--unset</code> instead of <code>shopt -s</code> and <code>-u</code>.</li>
<li>And <code>test --dir</code> <code>--exists</code>, etc. instead of <code>test -d</code>, <code>-e</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other enhancements to <code>shopt</code> and <code>test</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>shopt -p</code> respects option groups.  For example, <code>shopt -p oil:all</code> prints
the current value of all Oil options.
<ul>
<li>We may want <code>shopt --print</code> to use a clearer format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implemented <code>simple_test_builtin</code>, which enforces that <code>test</code>  accepts 2 or 3
arguments, and isn't spelled <code>[</code>.  This is on in <code>oil:all</code>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/08/31.html">Problems With the test Builtin: What Does -a
Mean?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idiom for turning on Oil is now:</p>
<pre><code>shopt --set oil:basic  
shopt --set oil:all    
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can use <code>bin/oil</code> to turn on <code>oil:all</code>.</p>
<a name="structured-io-read-line-write-qsn"></a>
<h3>Structured I/O: <code>read --line</code>, <code>write --qsn</code></h3>
<p>These changes were discussed in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html">Four Features That Justify a New Unix
Shell</a>.  We want to remove the need for ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</p>
<p>So we have preliminary <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support, but we still need more
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QTSV#QTSV">QTSV</a> support.</p>
<p>Another idea for a primitive:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>read -qsn-cells :var1 :var2</code> should read multiple cells on a line.  It
should split by tabs, and decode each field.  On the other hand,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QTSV#QTSV">QTSV</a> has typed columns (integers, floats, and booleans).</li>
</ul>
<a name="added-block-arguments-shopt-fork-forkwait"></a>
<h3>Added Block Arguments: <code>shopt</code>, <code>fork</code>, <code>forkwait</code></h3>
<p>This came directly out of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language
Idioms</a>.  Oil has a more consistent syntax:</p>
<pre><code>sleep 2 &amp;             
fork { sleep 2 }      

( sleep 2 )           
forkwait { sleep 2 }  
</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to use <code>&amp;</code> for redirects, and <code>()</code> for expressions.</p>
<p>We use the same block syntax to save and restore state:</p>
<pre><code>shopt --unset errexit {
  step1
  echo $?

  step2
  echo $?
}
</code></pre>
<p>This was enabled by a pleasant refactoring of the "option stack", which was
<a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/208950-zephyr-asdl/topic/ASDL.2Fstatic.20typing.20success">aided by static
typing</a>.
This stack is now used consistently for many purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>shopt</code> blocks</li>
<li>The broken POSIX <code>errexit</code> semantics.  Error handling is disabled in the
constructs <code>if / while / until / &amp;&amp;   ||   !</code>.  We unfortunately have to
implement this.</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin, which undoes this bad behavior by re-enabling <code>errexit</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>strict_errexit</code> option, which detects code that would <strong>lose errors</strong>.</li>
<li>Disabling <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dynamic-scope#dynamic-scope">dynamic scope</a> in procs, which I describe in
an upcoming post.  The option stack follows the call stack.</li>
</ol>
<a name="conclusion"></a>

November 8, 2020 | https://river.codes/demystifying-malloc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://river.codes/demystifying-malloc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>It feels wrong to use a tool without knowing fully how it works. As programmers it is hard to accept that there is only so much that can fit into our noggins at once, but looking at code benchmarks or stack traces to see that some large amount of time is spent in some low-level C code always makes me wonder what is really going on in there. Maybe you’re like me and occasionally start to use the ‘Go to definition’ IDE feature on standard libraries, and after a second or two of searching your window fills with scary underscores and <code>#DEFINE</code>s of things you didn’t know existed, you think maybe this thing was auto-generated and no human would bother writing this header-file-hell. Unsatisfied you go back to whatever you were working on, no closer to understanding what’s <em>really</em> going on down there.</p> <p>For me I was always perplexed by <code>malloc</code>. It’s a simple function, you ask for memory and it gives it to you. But <em>how</em> could a C function do that? What on Earth does it mean to <em>allocate</em> memory? Isn’t it all there, sitting on the bus, just <strong>waiting</strong> for us to issue some good ‘ol <code>MOV</code> instructions? Even worse, it is used <em>everywhere</em>. Even if you aren’t using C there’s a good chance you’re using <code>malloc</code>, every time you create a new object in a language implemented in C, like <code>cpython</code> for instance. It isn’t the only way to acquire memory, but it sure is a popular one.</p> <p>So let’s take a look at <code>malloc</code>, it can’t be that complicated right? Here’s a simple <code>malloc</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>From this you may be able to figure out what <code>sbrk</code> does. It gives us a chunk of memory. Specifically it allocates program heap memory of a given size and returns a pointer to it. What exactly is “it” that is being pointed to? Let’s start printing stuff and find out.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"[a: %p]</span><span>\n</span><span>[b: %p]</span><span>\n</span><span>[c: %p]</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <div><div><pre><code>&gt; [a: 0x1065b4064]
  [b: 0x1065b4064]
  [c: 0x1065b40c8]
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Looks like <code>b</code> is the same as <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> is <code>b + 100</code> bytes. So <code>sbrk</code> returns a pointer to whatever the last ‘tip’ of the program heap is, and if we give it a size in bytes it’ll move that ‘tip’ up. Meaning if we <code>sbrk</code> ourselves that 100 byte chunk we can do whatever we want with it knowing that the next time we <code>sbrk</code> ourselves some more memory, it’ll be 100 bytes farther along.</p> <p>This may not be too satisfying, we’ve replaced one magical function with another. However, in this case <code>sbrk</code> is a system call. It’s going to jump the CPU over to some assembly to execute (the instruction set implemented by your CPU is very likely to have a set of functions for interfacing with memory), at least now we’re talking to the kernel instead of wondering what’s going in the the C standard library.</p> <p>So that’s <code>malloc</code>, simple right? Well judging from the length of this article you can probably deduce otherwise. There’s more here, and for two reasons:</p> <ol> <li><code>sbrk</code> is absolutely ancient and super-deprecated. In fact if you run these snippets on macOS you’re going to get tons of warnings (but hey, it still works!). It doesn’t work with virtual memory and it isn’t thread-safe. However, its API is very simple to use and <code>malloc</code> at one point in time very likely was implemented using <code>sbrk</code>.</li> <li>This implementation of <code>malloc</code> is incorrect. The first reason why, which you may be able to guess, is that <code>sbrk</code> can fail. Memory is a finite resource.</li> </ol> <p>According to <code>man sbrk</code>, the call can return -1 if it fails, but <code>malloc</code> is supposed to return <code>NULL</code>. This is fixed easily enough.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>==</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>?</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>:</span> <span>chunk_start</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>One more thing. <code>malloc(0)</code> has special behavior, it needs to return <code>NULL</code> as well, otherwise you’d be able to get a pointer back from <code>malloc</code> that you didn’t actually allocate, and that would be weird.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>size</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
  <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>sbrk</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>chunk_start</span> <span>==</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>?</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>:</span> <span>chunk_start</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Great, now the user can actually know whether their memory request was fulfilled. We’re still missing something though, the result of our <code>malloc</code> doesn’t work with <code>free</code>. What <em>is</em> <code>free</code> exactly?</p> <p>According to <code>man free</code>, <code>free</code> will remove the allocation (“free”ing the space) from an input pointer that was previously returned from malloc. Now <code>sbrk</code> has a feature where when a negative input is passed to it, it will move the tip of the heap <em>down</em> instead of up. So effectively it allows us to push and pop from the program heap, because the heap is a stack and computer terminology is silly.</p> <p>Unfortunately this isn’t enough for us. Imagine a user does the following:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>500</span><span>);</span>
<span>// We can now call sbrk(-500) to free a.</span>
<span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
<span>// But how do we free a from here?</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This is the age-old problem of trying to delete something from the middle of the stack. We could pop everything off of the stack until we reach the memory we’re trying to delete (storing it somewhere else, we could even use the disk), then pop the item to delete, then push everything else back onto the stack. This would be miserably slow. We could also abandon the stack mentality and just use <code>memcpy</code> to copy over the old bytes. This would also be very slow, usually we expect <code>free</code> to take an insignificant amount of time to complete. In either of these cases, we’ve created a new problem: when shifting all of the old memory to utilize the newly free’d space, all of the pointers in the program refering to that old memory would be invalidated.</p> <p>It looks like we’re going to have take matters into our own hands. Maybe in the future we’ll have more memory than we know what to do with and never free anything. Until then we’ll need to do something clever. We have one thing going for us though, <code>malloc</code> always returns a pointer to <em>contiguous</em> memory. If we have a single “hole” of <code>free</code>d memory in the heap large enough to use somewhere, we can use it. It’s simply a matter, then, of us keeping track of the allocated chunks (and the “holes” created by <code>free</code>ing those chunks) ourselves.</p> <p>So maybe it was wrong to say earlier that <code>sbrk</code> “allocates” memory for us, because now it seems like it just moves some pointer and tells us where it used to be. The actual “allocation” part of <code>malloc</code> is something we’ll have to implement. Let’s set up a general outline of what we want to accomplish.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>chunk</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We want some way to model the heap, so a linked list sounds simple enough. We could extend it to create an actual stack, but it isn’t really needed here. Normally we’d implement a linked list using <code>malloc</code>, but we’re implementing <code>malloc</code> so we can’t really use that, can we? So let’s just sneak our data structure in with the user data. The general idea is that for every chunk of memory allocated by <code>malloc</code>, the we store a few bytes (specifically <code>sizeof(Chunk)</code>) of metadata about that chunk right beforehand. We could store a pointer in Chunk to the actual user memory, but since the memory is contiguous we can easily compute where the metadata ends and the user data begins. <code>free</code>ing then becomes super easy, we can just get the metadata and mark that it’s no longer allocated. The hard part is using that information.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// Allocates a new chunk right after 'prev'.</span>
<span>Chunk</span><span>*</span> <span>allocate_chunk</span><span>(</span><span>Chunk</span><span>*</span> <span>prev</span><span>,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>chunk</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>From here you can devise faster ways of doing this. The memory-speed tradeoff here is real, you can avoid scanning the heap every time by reserving a portion of the start of the heap for a hash map storing holes by size requirement, but then of course you’ve got less of the heap for the user. You also need to consider the size of this portion. You won’t be able to grow it, since then you’d be invalidating user pointers.</p> <p>If speed is less of a concern, you’d want to scan the entire heap rather than stopping at the first available hole. With the above implementation the user would often get back chunks of memory where the allocation is actually greater than they requested. If you scan the entire heap, you can look for the smallest hole that fits the requirements. Another way of doing this is to terminate the chunk to always fit the requested size, creating a new chunk for the leftover data. You’d have to make sure whatever leftover has enough room for the metadata fields.</p> <p>This is why the data stored in the pointer returned from <code>malloc</code> is uninitiliazed, it may have been a chunk from some previously requested memory.</p> <p>The last bit is where we actually build up the heap model:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>Chunk</span><span>*</span> <span>allocate_chunk</span><span>(</span><span>Chunk</span><span>*</span> <span>prev</span><span>,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Fifth Edition, 2017</span>
</p>


<p>
<em>The Autodesk File</em> chronicles the history of Autodesk, Inc.
and its principal product, AutoCAD,
through contemporary documents edited and annotated
by Autodesk founder and former CEO <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">John Walker</a>.
The book traces the company from the first glimmer of an idea in the
minds of the founders, through start-up, initial public stock
offering, and growth from a loose confederation of moonlighting
individuals to a leader in the industry of computer aided design.
The book is available in several different editions, suited
for on- or off-line reading with various tools.  Click on
the titles of the section describing the edition you prefer
to view it or download to your computer.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/">Fifth Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/figures/af5_screenshot.png" width="256" height="252" alt="The Autodesk File: Fifth Edition"></a>
The Fifth Edition (2017) of <cite>The Autodesk File</cite> was prepared to
commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of Autodesk
in 1982.  Except for correction of a few typographical errors, the
content is identical to that of the 1994 fourth edition, but the
book has been entirely reformatted and updated to contemporary
Web standards.  The typography uses Unicode text entities, and should
be much easier on the eye.  Each chapter is now a single document,
instead of being broken into sections and subsections, and easier
to read without incessant clicking on navigation buttons.  All of
the AutoCAD sample drawings used as illustrations have been
re-made from their original PostScript plot files with higher
resolution.  The pop-up windows for footnotes (which were irritating
and ran afoul of some browser pop-up blockers) have been replaced by
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/i/footnote.png" width="16" height="16" alt="[Footnote]">
icons which display the footnote when clicked.  Cross-references
are indicated by an
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/i/xref.png" width="16" height="16" alt="[Ref]">
icon which navigates to the cited page when clicked.  A navigation
bar at the left provides instant access to all chapters, and
highlights the current chapter regardless of how you arrived there.
The <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/">Fifth Edition</a> is compatible with
most modern desktop browsers.  The Safari browser on iOS mobile devices
(iPad, iPhone) has a serious flaw in scrolling text within a
window which has remained uncorrected for years.  On these devices,
you can read the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/indexi.html">iOS work-around edition</a>,
which contains a device-specific fix for the problem.
<br>
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/autoframe.html">Fourth Edition with Frames</a></h2>

<p>
For older browsers which which support frames, this
edition allows navigation through the book with
a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go
directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser
supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a
footnote icon, like this one:
<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/i/foot.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="[Footnote]">
will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the
mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window.
Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled
JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in
the main document window by clicking the footnote icon,
then use their browser's “Back” button to return to the
main text.  Users with more modern browers will find the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/">Fifth Edition</a> easier to read and
navigate.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/autofile.html">No-Frame Web Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/autofile.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/figures/any_browser.gif" width="88" height="31" alt="Works with Any Browser"></a>
Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those
who prefer a more linear presentation in a single
window, may access a no-frame edition of <cite>The Autodesk
File</cite> with identical content to the frame-based book.
The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present
in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack
frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click
on the footnote icon to display it, then use the
“Back” button or keystroke to return to the text containing
the footnote.

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/afpdf.zip" name="offline">Acrobat PDF Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/afpdf.zip"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/figures/afpdf.gif" width="226" height="234" alt="Acrobat PDF Screen"></a>
If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/afpdf.zip">download a PDF edition</a> (5.8 Mb, ZIP compressed)
which you
can read with the Adobe Acrobat Reader utility,
available for most personal computers and Unix workstations,
which may be
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/readstep.html" target="Autofile_Aux">downloaded
free of charge</a> directly from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="Autofile_Aux">Adobe Systems</a> Web site.
The Acrobat PDF edition preserves all the formatting of
the original book, some of which was lost in creating
the Web editions, and permits point-and-click navigation
among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.
</p>

<p>
Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies
on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you
a nice button for downloading your own copy of Acrobat Reader,
but they won't let me use the image without “registering”
and “licensing” it, which I'm certainly not going to do
in order to promote their product and its file format.
<br>
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/afps.zip">PostScript Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<cite>The Autodesk File</cite> was originally typeset
using <a href="http://www.tug.org/" target="Autofile_Aux">TeX</a> with the
LaTeX macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated
from PostScript created by the <tt>dvips</tt>
utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic
file, more than 16 megabytes, containing the
entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line
with a PostScript viewing program such as
<a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/" target="Autofile_Aux">GhostScript</a>
(which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible
printer.  <strong>Before sending this
file to a printer, consider that the book is almost
900 pages long!</strong>  This is a <em>big</em> print
job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and,
potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom
you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be
downloaded as either a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/afps.zip">ZIPped archive</a>
or a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/autofile.ps.gz"><b>gzip</b> compressed PostScript
file</a>; both are 4.9 Mb in length and uncompress to a 16
Mb PostScript file.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><p>Adding context to thousands of dots</p><p> published:&nbsp; <time datetime="2020-10-21T00:00:00+00:00"> 21 October 2020 </time></p></header><p>Adding a map to your visuals is a great way to quickly understand the geographic information you're trying to investigate. Thankfully there are quite a few packages and libraries (like <a href="https://geopandas.org/">geopandas</a>, <a href="https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/">cartopy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rossant/smopy">smopy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium">folium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/TileMapBase">tilemapbase</a>, or <a href="https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ipyleaflet</a>) that can make creating these visuals fairly straightforward and easy in your jupyter notebooks or whatever stack you're using.</p><p>For this essay though, I'll walk through the process of adding a base-map from OpenStreetMap to you're matplotlib visuals without using any of these libraries. In the end, we'll have a visual much like this (very messy) scatter-plot of buses as they service route 16 in New Orleans.</p><img alt="A plot of the ~466,000 position reports for buses servicing route 16 as they work their way up and down South Claiborne Avenue, between South Carrollton Avenue and Harrah's near the French Quarter." src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/route-16-plot.png"><div id="how-it-works"><h2>How it Works</h2><p>The ability to add our base-map to our <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> visuals relies on matplotlib's <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html">imshow() function</a>, which internally uses the <a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Pillow library</a> to display images, or any other two dimensional scalar data we want (like <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html">numpy arrays</a>).</p><p>For example, if we download <a href="https://bryanbrattlof.com/pages/hi/profile.png">my self-portrait</a>, we can add the image to a plot using code like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>import</span> <span>pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>

<span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imread</span><span>(</span><span>'path/to/my/self-portrait.png'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>)</span>

<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div><p>Resulting in a matplotlib visual that looks like this:</p><p><img alt="A matplotlib plot of a self portrait (stick figure drawing) of Bryan Brattlof" src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/self-portrait-plot.png"></p></div><div id="creating-the-map"><h2>Creating the Map</h2><p>The easiest way to generate the base-map for <code>plt.imshow()</code> is to use a mapping service. These mapping services use enormous amounts of raw computing power to take the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm">terabytes of map data</a> and render a map for us. Today there are quite a few services available online. The one I enjoy working with (and the one we will be using in this essay) is a free, community maintained service called <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p></div><div id="tile-servers"><h2>Tile Servers</h2><p>To make updating and sharing their work easier, OpenStreetMap (and virtually all other mapping services) have split their maps into billions of tiny (256 pixel) sections, called tiles, that we can download individually from their tile servers.</p><p>OpenStreetMap has <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers">quite a few tile servers</a> that style or prioritize different map features with some having a slightly different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> to request tiles. For example the <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/toner/#12/29.9722/-90.1167">Stamen Toner Map</a> that I used in the first visual and prefer for it's simple color pallet.</p><p>For this essay though, we'll use the default tile server's API to request tiles:</p><div><pre><span></span>URL = "https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png".format
</pre></div><p>This string formatting function will replace the <code>{z}</code>, <code>{x}</code>, and <code>{y}</code> with the tile coordinates and zoom level of the tile we want to download, where:</p><ul><li><code>{z}</code> is the "zoom" level ranging from 0 to 18. Zoom 0 being the most "zoomed out" and needs only one tile to depict <a href="https://tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png">the entire world</a> at that level.</li><li><code>{x}</code> is the number of tiles from the left most tile of the map.</li><li>and <code>{y}</code> is the number of tiles from the top most tile of the map.</li></ul><p>Both <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> depend on the zoom level <code>{z}</code> we've chosen, with larger zoom levels requiring more tiles to render the map. To understand how to calculate which tiles we need for our data-set, we'll need to understand how mapping projections work.</p></div><div id="map-projections"><h2>Map Projections</h2><p>Without going too deep into mapping projections, OpenStreetMap (along with many other mapping services) needed a way to convert <span>(<i>lat</i>, <i>lon</i>)</span> coordinates into planer <span>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</span> coordinates which work with their maps. Sadly there is no perfect way to do this.</p><p>Google (and everyone else eventually) settled on a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</a> called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection">Web Mercator Projection</a> which simplifies the conversion by assuming the earth is a perfect sphere (it's not). This can (and does) lead to confusion in the final visuals and why many official bodies refuse to accept this standard.</p><p>The advantage of assuming the earth is a perfect sphere is that the equation to convert our GPS coordinates into Web Mercator coordinates is fairly straightforward. The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap Wiki</a> has the algorithm available in <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mercator">multiple programming languages</a>. Here is the one for Python:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>math</span>

For simplicity though, I'll calculate the <span><i>min</i></span> and <span><i>max</i></span> of both the <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> columns in my <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> DataFrame:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>top</span><span>,</span> <span>bot</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>.</span><span>lat</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(),</span> <span>df</span><span>.</span><span>lat</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>()</span>

Essentially some fraction of each tile we've downloaded (outlined in black) will be used in our final visual (outlined in red) that we calculated in <a href="#stitching-tiles-together">the last section</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, I’ve re-read “Test Driven Development: By Example” by Kent Beck.
I was amazed by the simplicity of his process, consisting of small pragmatic steps.
So, I decided to put the process to the test in an unfamiliar domain.</p>
<h3 id="the-kata">The kata</h3>
<p>In this kata, I am going to develop a serverless service in AWS using a Lambda and the API Gateway.
I chose this task because, on the one hand, it will contain a fair amount of infrastructure code, which is considered hard to test.
On the other hand, because I wanted a task that was more abstract and closer to a business requirement in contrast to a technical requirement like ‘<em>deploy an AWS HTTP API Gateway</em>’.</p>
<p>My goal is to understand whether TDD for infrastructure is possible and what are the trade-offs.</p>
<h3 id="the-tdd-process">The TDD process</h3>
<p>I am going to be following the TDD process, as described in the book, as close as possible.
I will attempt to follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: Start by writing a failing test. It may not even compile at that time.</li>
<li>Green: Make the test pass, committing any sin necessary in the process.</li>
<li>Refactor: Eliminate any duplication introduced to make the tests green.</li>
</ul>
<p>One important piece of the process is having a <strong>To-Do</strong> list.
It is going to help me keep track of what is left to do and help me discover what to work on next.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">To-Do List

* Publish sales API</code></pre></div>
<p>What is new for me is an appreciation of TDD as a process to manage my uncertainty and fear, rather than a process to write tests.
You can read more about this in my previous blog post, <a href="https://blog.gchinis.com/posts/the-trade-offs-of-tdd/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tech-stack">Tech stack</h3>
<p>Being cognizant of the uncertainty, I decided to use as much as possible familiar tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.</li>
<li>Javascript for the Lambda.</li>
<li>Jest as a test runner.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably tools better than terraform when it comes to testability.
What I want to demonstrate is that the TDD process is independent of the tools you have to work with.</p>
<p>There are also aspects of this task that I am not familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the API Gateway</li>
<li>Using TDD in an infrastructure heavy task</li>
</ul>
<p>I will have to be careful to tackle them in small increments, so that I don’t get overwhelmed.</p>
<h2 id="putting-terraform-under-test-harness">Putting Terraform under test harness</h2>
<p>‘<em>Publish sales API</em>’ is a very big task to do in one step.
So, let’s look for a more achievable intermediate step to start with.
If I can have a test which applies a minimal terraform configuration, I will at least know that I can put terraform under test harness, which is a prerequisite to the TDD cycle.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">To-Do List
==========
* Publish sales API
<span>* Run terraform in test</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Test snippet</strong></p>
<p>The test uses the simplest approach I can think of to drive terraform.
It does what I would do in the command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> {<span>execSync</span>} <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'child_process'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>https</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'https'</span>);

  <span>test</span>(<span>'run terraform'</span>, () =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> <span>modulePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>'./src'</span>;
    <span>execSync</span>(<span>'terraform init'</span>, {<span>cwd</span><span>:</span> <span>modulePath</span>});
    <span>const</span> <span>applyResp</span> <span>=</span> <span>execSync</span>(<span>'terraform apply -auto-approve'</span>, {<span>cwd</span><span>:</span> <span>modulePath</span>});

  <span>region</span> = <span>"eu-central-1"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Writing this test was hard work but making it green required only 3 lines of boilerplate code!
Still, it is an important milestone.
It demonstrates that it is possible to use jest to drive terraform to <em>act</em> and then also <em>assert</em> on the outcome of the operation.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-lambda">Deploying the Lambda</h2>
<p>Even with terraform under test harness, deploying the sales API in one step, is still too big a task.
What I find especially challenging about the task ahead, is doing all the infrastructure automation in one go, especially since I am unfamiliar with the API Gateway.</p>
<p>I think a smaller task, that I feel comfortable to undertake, is to deploy the AWS Lambda with my application code and make sure I can invoke it using the aws-sdk.
Let’s update the To-Do List with our next steps.</p>

<p>I’ve refactor the test code from before, and I’ve extracted a <code>beforeAll</code> block where the

<p>All in all, I wrote 3 tests which take around 15 seconds to run including the <code>terraform apply</code>.</p>
<p>This is about one order of magnitude slower than what I am used to, when I write tests for classic applications.
Still, it is one of the fastest feedback cycles I’ve experienced doing infrastructure.</p>
<p>I hope I demonstrated that a TDD approach is a viable approach for developing infrastructure code.
Of course, with dedicated tooling it gets easier to write tests.
However, you can use simple tools to start …</p></div></div>

<p>💡 TL;DR Trustpilot and Glassdoor are PR agencies for companies. Not impartial review platforms for customers. This creates a challenging incentive problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trustpilot enables customers to review companies and Glassdoor enables employees to review companies. They have similar and fascinating business models. Let’s dive into Trustpilot.</p>
<p><strong>How does Trustpilot work?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s imagine you are setting up an online physiotherapy clinic called StiffNecks.com. To build your reputation as a clinic you create a Trustpilot page. The first client comes along, has a great experience, and you send them an email to the Trustpilot page asking them to leave a review. The client had a great experience and writes a lovely review of StiffNecks.com rating it 5/5 stars. BOOM your Trustpilot page now has a 3.5/5 “TrustScore”. Wait, what?!</p>
<p>With that 3.5/5 rating, TrustPilot now has you hostage. They use a <a href="https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201748946-TrustScore-explained-How-is-the-TrustScore-calculated-">Bayesian average</a> to calculate the TrustScore which takes into account how old the reviews are, the frequency you collect reviews, and they start you with a lovely 7 reviews of 3.5 for good measure. In other words, they control what your reputation is. And they charge businesses for this service with incentives misaligned from the business and definitely the customer.</p>
<p>Let’s jump back to StiffNecks.com. You now have anxiety from the yellow 3.5/5 score staring at you and so with each new customer, you do your best to push them towards Trustpilot. Eventually, (with about 10x5 star reviews) you get past the dreaded 4/5 threshold beyond which no customer dares to buy. But with each new review, it signals to customers that this is a valid reflection of your business’s reputation. And did I forget that you get penalised if the frequency of collecting reviews decreases. No stopping now. A few days later you get a call from Trustpilot agent offering the paid service.</p>
<p><strong>Where do the incentives go wrong?</strong></p>
<p>The immediate incentive is for Trustpilot to charge businesses more. Pretty easy to do when they directly control a business’s reputation. How can Trustpilot charge more? By either threatening to reduce their reputation or helping them to improve their score.</p>
<p>How do you help a company improve their score? At the moment Trustpilot uses widgets to show reviews and tools to collect reviews. But… there’s also strong incentives for Trustpilot to curate/remove negative reviews. Something that is already happening at Glassdoor (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24789865">anecdotal evidence here</a>).</p>
<p>What does this mean for the customer? Believing in Trustpilot as a measure of reputation is a crucial part of their flywheel. But there’s much stronger incentives to be on the side of helping paying businesses have an artificially high score.</p>
<p><strong>How can Trustpilot remedy this?</strong></p>
<p>I think Trustpilot is an awesome service for consumers but the incentive problem is tough… For Trustpilot to truly fix the incentive problem they would need to be directly aligned with the reviewer. But the obvious business models such as a paywalling reviews would strongly interfere with their flywheel.</p>
<p>It’s possible to continue charging businesses. But Trustpilot would need to play the long game - not fudging the reviews at any cost. Instead, continuing to be a forcing function for businesses to treat their customers better, and thus improve their score. But, moderating reviews is hard because customer experience is subjective and Trustpilot does not have proper validation for who has and has not been a customer. Solutions to the verification problem seem feasible, such as the Facebook retargeting mechanism of sharing a hashed list of their customer emails.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix: The Trustpilot flywheel</strong></p>
<p>More companies email customers to leave reviews on Trustpilot → More customers leave reviews → More customers trust and use Trustpilot → More companies sign up to Trustpilot → More companies email customers to leave reviews on Trustpilot → …</p></section></div>]]>

In this post, I’d like to see how easy, or how hard, it is to port a simple Spring Boot application to Micronaut.</p> <div> <h2 id="setting-up-the-context">Setting up the context</h2> <div> <p>The <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr> is an great piece of technology. Modern versions compile the running <em>bytecode</em> to native code, depending on the existing workload. For this reason, JVM applications are on par with - or even winning over - native executables regarding to runtime performance.</p> <p>JVM applications have a warm-up time during which they don’t perform well. The loading of classes at runtime doesn’t help. Frameworks such as Spring and Jakarta EE have been making use of classpath scanning and reflection, which make startup time even longer. For long-running processes, such as traditional application servers, this is not an issue.</p> <p>In the context of containers, it is. Because one handles containers as cattle and not pets, the platform <em>e.g.</em> Kubernetes kills pods and schedules new ones at regular intervals. The longer the startup time, the less relevant the JVM becomes. It becomes even worse in Serverless environments that need to auto-scale the number of pods quickly.</p> <p>To hop on the bandwagon, Oracle offers <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/substratevm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SubstrateVM</a>. A subcomponent of GraalVM, SubstrateVM, allows transforming JVM bytecode into a native executable. To do that, SubstrateVM compiles the bytecode <abbr title="Ahead-Of-Time">AOT</abbr>. For that reason, you need to explicitly feed it information that is available on the JVM at runtime. It’s the case of reflection for example. Note that some JVM features are not ported to GraalVM. Moreover, the AOT compilation is a time-consuming process.</p> <p>The result is that on one hand, we have the JVM and all its features leveraged by frameworks; on the other hand, we have native executables that require fine-tuned manual configuration and a massive amount of build time.</p> <p>A new generation of frameworks has spawned that aims to find a middle ground <em>i.e.</em> Micronaut and Quarkus. They both aim to generate bytecode AOT. Note that this AOT is different from the one mentioned above. Instead of using reflection at runtime, which is expensive, both frameworks generate extra classes at build time. This also allows us to avoid classpath scanning at startup time. In short, the idea is about making as much code as possible available at build time.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="the-sample-application">The sample application</h2> <div> <p>I want the sample application to migrate to be simple enough so I can migrate it by myself but not to the point of being trivial. It consists of the following:</p> <ul><li><span>A controller layer implemented by Spring MVC</span></li><li><span>A repository layer implemented by Spring Data JPA</span></li><li><span>A JPA entity</span></li><li><span>Schema generation and data insertion at startup via Spring Boot</span></li><li><span>The Spring Boot actuator, with the <code>health</code> and <code>beans</code> endpoints enabled and accessible without authentication</span></li></ul> <p>The application is written in Kotlin. I’ll be using H2 as the database to make the whole setup less complex.</p> <p>In general, I try to approach migrations in a step-by-step way. To do that, Micronaut offers a dedicated Micronaut-Spring dependency. I must admit I didn’t manage to make it work the way I wanted. Thus, I did a big-bang migration. The rest of this post will focus on different places for the migration.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="common-changes">Common changes</h2> <div> <p>The first change is to replace the parent POM.</p> <div> <p>pom.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;parent&gt;</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p>2020-11-08</p>
<p>This is a little demonstration of how little you need to host your own git
repositories and have a modest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a>
system for them. All you need is a unixy
server you can ssh into, but arguably you can try this out locally as well.
We will use Redis at one point to queue tasks, but
strictly speaking this can be achieved without additional software. To keep things
simple this will only work with one repository, since this is only describing a
pattern.</p>
<p>The source code to all of that follows below can be found <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Estchris/tiny-ci">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Hosting bare git repositories</h2>
<p>Assuming you can ssh into a server and create a directory, this is all you need
to create a shareable git repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git init --bare
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally you are using a distinct user for it (named <code>git</code>) and have it set to
use <code>git-shell</code> as its default shell. By convention bare repositories are stored
in directories which end in <code>.git</code>. You can now clone this repository from your
machine with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone ssh://git@host.example.com/~git/repo.git
</code></pre>
<h2>post-receive hooks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#post-receive">post-receive hook</a> is an executable which can do some work as soon as something new was pushed to the repository. We will use an executable shell script which needs to go inside the <code>hooks</code> directory of the (bare) repository on the server side.</p>
<p>Now the most trivial thing to do would be to do the actual work in here, but this would block the <code>git push</code> on the client side, so we just want to enqueue a new job, return a handle and exit. If what you do takes only a short amount of time, you can stop here. Alternatively you can use this repository for deployments only, by defining it as a separate remote. But the goal here is to have tests run on every push, so we will split the job creation from the actual run.</p>
<p>This is where Redis comes into play for the job queueing. We will assume redis is installed and running and we will use redis-cli to access it from the script. We will use two data structures: a list of jobs waiting to be executed, referenced by a UUID we will generate and a hash where we can store the git revision and the state associated to a given job, as well as its output.</p>
<p>Note that git is passing three arguments to the script via stdin: the old revision before the push, the new revision and the current ref.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
while read -r _ newrev ref
do
	id=$(uuid)
	echo "Starting CI job $id"
	redis-cli hset "$id" rev "$newrev" &gt;/dev/null
	redis-cli hset "$id" ref "$ref" &gt;/dev/null
	redis-cli lpush jobs "$id" &gt;/dev/null
done
</code></pre>
<h2>Defining build jobs</h2>
<p>By convention our system will run whatever is in an executable script named <code>ci.sh</code>. The drawback is that this only works with trusted systems and access to the repository needs to be guarded to prevent random code execution. The big advantage is that we don't need to come up with a job definition DSL or cumbersome file format.</p>
<p>Our convention will also be that the script will be passed one argument: the name of the git ref, so we can decide what to do based on the branch we are on.</p>
<p>Let's just put this into a file named <code>ci.sh</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# the git ref gets passed in as the only argument
ref="$1"

# pretend we're running tests
echo "running tests"

# only deploy if we're on the main branch
[[ "$ref" == "refs/heads/main" ]] &amp;&amp; echo "Deploying"
</code></pre>
<h2>The build runner</h2>
<p>Now that jobs are queued the last piece missing is a job runner. We will make use of Redis' <a href="https://redis.io/commands/blpop">BLPOP command</a> to block until the jobs list has a new job for us. That job id will give us the revision we need to check out and will allow us to write back the output and status of the job.</p>
<p>Note that, as discussed, this assumes a repository called <code>test</code> is already checked out right next to the script.</p>
<p>tiny-ci.sh</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# ./runner.sh is supposed to run on the server where your git repository lives

# the logic in here will run in an infinite loop:
# * (block and) wait for a job
# * run it
while :
do

# Announce that we're waiting
echo "Job runner waiting"

# We are using https://redis.io/commands/blpop to block until we have a new
# message on the "jobs" list. We use `tail` to get the last line because the
# output of BLPOP is of the form "list-that-got-an-element\nelement"
jobid=$(redis-cli blpop jobs 0 | tail -n 1)

# The message we received will have the job uuid
echo "Running job $jobid"

# Get the git revision we're supposed to check out
rev=$(redis-cli hget "${jobid}" "rev")
echo Checking out revision "$rev"

# Get the git ref
ref=$(redis-cli hget "${jobid}" "ref")

# Prepare the repository (hardcoded path) by getting that commit
cd test || exit; git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset --hard "$rev";

# Actually runs the job and saves the output
if ! output=$(./ci.sh "$ref" 2&gt;&amp;1);
then
    status="failed";
else
    status="success";
fi;

# Update the result status
redis-cli hset "${jobid}" "status" $status;

# Update the job output
redis-cli hset "${jobid}" "output" "$output";

echo "Job ${jobid} done"

done
</code></pre>
<h2>Running it</h2>
<p>Summing up:</p>
<ul>
<li>there's a bare git repository somewhere, called <code>test.git</code></li>
<li>we can clone the empty repo (or create a new one and add the respective remote)</li>
<li>on the server hosting the git repository we clone <code>test.git</code> into <code>test</code> and place <code>tiny-ci.sh</code> next to it</li>
<li>we run builds by starting <code>tiny-ci.sh</code> on the server hosting the repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if we <code>git push</code> a new commit to the <code>main</code> branch with the <code>ci.sh</code> file from above, the output will return the job id</p>
<pre><code>Enumerating objects: 5, done.
...
remote: Starting CI job dab82634-21cc-11eb-b3b3-9b8767dff47c
</code></pre>
<h2>Checking build status</h2>
<p>Knowing a job uuid, the easiest way to get the status
of a build is by using the <code>--csv</code> style output of the <a href="https://redis.io/commands/hgetall">HGETALL</a> command of redis.</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh example.com redis-cli --csv hgetall $JOB_UUID
"rev","f0706ea18a22031f84619b1161c8fbdb0dcd6850","ref","refs/heads/master","status","success","output","running tests\nDeploying"
</code></pre>
<h2>Possible further improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>multi-repo support</strong></p>
<p>This would mean changes to the <code>post-receive</code> hook to put jobs in a list named <code>job-${REPONAME}</code> and then have the worker also react based on that. Notice how <code>redis-cli blpop</code> takes several lists to watch and will also return the name of the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>job cleanup</strong></p>
<p>Creating a key for every job pollutes the redis database unnecesarily. Enqueuing the job could be done via <a href="https://redis.io/commands/setex">SETEX</a> so that the keys go away after one hour / one day / one week. The purpose of Redis here is short term storage and not long-term archival of job results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>more workers</strong></p>
<p>Scaling to multiple workers on the same machine would need different working folders (and some process isolation depending on the tasks run in there). Scaling to multiple machines would need access to a central redis instance for job distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>worker isolation / sandboxing</strong></p>
<p>For more complex tasks some kind of process and file-system isolation is necessary. The worker could spin up VMs or Docker containers. The build system used on <a href="https://builds.sr.ht/">builds.sr.ht</a> for instance uses a <a href="https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/installation.md#security-model">Docker container run as an unprivileged user in a KVM qemu machine</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>timestamps</strong></p>
<p>For convenience you would definitely want timestamps for every operation. This also allows to list queries like "the last five jobs" or to do maintenance on job results based on their time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>notifications</strong></p>
<p>Any CI system will have some form of notifications and the simplest form would be to do something in the script, right at the end. But this covers only the success case, so a better approach would be to create a notification queue and have a notification worker react on that.</p>

                <p>Indian food and grocery chain Big Basket was reported to have fallen prey to a data breach, with details of two crore of its customers reportedly being put up for sale on the dark web.&nbsp;</p><p>The retail giant known for online sale and delivery of groceries was founded in 2011 and offers its services across the country. Online grocery shopping became all the more popular in India ever since the country was placed under lockdown in light of the COVID 19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>According to researchers at Cyble, the data breach was discovered during a routine sweep of the dark web on Friday. Cyble, in an official update on their website, stated that the data was being offered for sale for USD 40,000. Based on the data examined so far, Cyble believes that it was hacked from Big Basket servers in mid-October this year.&nbsp;</p><p>“The leak contains a database portion, with the table name ‘member_member’. The size of the SQL file is 15 GB, containing close to 20 Million user data. More specifically, this includes names, email IDs, password hashes, contact numbers (mobile + phone), addresses, date of birth, location, and IP addresses of login, among many others,” Cyble update said.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyble founder Beenu Arora told CySpy India that inquiries were still underway regarding the threat actor who was offering the data for sale, and that all the details regarding the incident had been shared with Big Basket.&nbsp;</p><p>CySpy India has reached out to Big Basket for comment and their response will be added to this article as soon as it is received.</p><p>Cyble has acquired the data and published it on its indexing website - AmiBreached - where users who suspect that their details might be part of the leaked data can check for the same.&nbsp;</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Teardown started as a technology experiment and it’s one of those games where gameplay was designed to fit the technology, rather than the other way around. It’s not the first time I’ve been involved in such projects (Sprinkle, Smash Hit), and probably not the last, but Teardown was by far the most frustrating experience yet.</p>

<p>The idea of a fully destructible environment is compelling for the player but a nightmare for the game designer. Walls can no longer be used as obstacles, key objects that the player might need to complete an objective can break and the designer is no longer in control over a players path through the game, potentially breaking the intended progression. Not to mention all the technical hurdles a fully destructible environment implies when it comes to physics, lighting, scripting, etc, but more on that is a future blog post.</p>

<p>Destruction is often used in games as a decorative special effect, but for Teardown the intention was always to use destruction as the key element in gameplay and with a limited amount of action, allowing the player to do detailed precision work rather than total mayhem.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2020-11-05-teardown.png"><img src="http://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2020-11-05-teardown.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>After nearly a full year of experimentation and many failed prototypes, the idea of a two-phase heist setting was born. It’s compatible with all the limitations (or lack thereof) that a fully destructible environment impose, while still offering an interesting challenge. It allows the player to move around freely in a fully accessible environment, carefully planning the heist and creating shortcuts using destruction, vehicles and objects from the environment in a creative way. The player chooses when, and I think it’s important that this is the players decision, to go into action mode and try out the created path.</p>


<p>Allowing the player to destroy everything has a huge impact on level design. Since any wall can be torn down, the only true obstacles at our disposal are elevation, distance, water and unbreakable objects. We could use unbreakable objects more, but it would make the environment harder to read and imply a failure to deliver on the promise of a fully destructible environment. Therefore unbreakable objects are only used for rock formations and the ground you’re standing on.</p>

<p>The relatively small level size started as a technical limitation, but I don’t think the game would benefit from larger levels even if it was technically possible. Villa Gordon is currently the largest level in the game, and it can already be a bit tedious to walk around during the preparation phase. Personally I think the game shines in a more compact and cluttered environment like Hollowrock Island, with some verticality to allow for more interesting shortcuts.</p>

<p>The only place we found the level size to be a limitation was the end chase on Frustrum level. We originally anticipated it to be twice as long, but due to a 3D texture size limitation on AMD graphics cards, we had to restrict it to 400 meters. We could have made it twice as long using a U-shaped level, but we also wanted to keep the level straight to have the goal direction consistently aligned with the sun.</p>


<p>Nobody likes a timer, and in previous iterations of the game idea there was no timer. Since the game offers so much player freedom, the only viable option to impose any form of challenge would be resource limitations, and for a sandbox game where destruction plays a central role, adding restrictive resource limitations just doesn’t make the game fun. The goal with the alarm timer has always been to offer a challenge even with a generous amount of tools and resources. While I can agree that a timer is usually a bad idea in game design, I’m really happy the way it turned out in Teardown.</p>

<p>Along the way we’ve mixed up the timed missions with other types where the challenge comes more from moving heavy objects, demolishing buildings or putting out fires, but I’m not convinced that alone could support a whole game. In several missions there are alarmed targets attached to something heavy, allowing it to be moved around to some extent, which I think is a good mix, letting the player choose whether to tinker with the environment or just make a run for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2020-11-05-chopper.png"><img src="http://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2020-11-05-chopper.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>A popular suggestion has been to have the security chopper chase the player after arriving to the scene instead of 	instant failure, but as a general solution I don’t think it’s a good idea. It would introduce an element of randomness that would discourage the strategic thinking and careful planning that this game is all about, in favor of just replaying the mission until reaching the escape vehicle before dying. So instead we added a separate mission type that still allows the player to make preparations, but the chopper shows up shortly after clearing the first target, effectively replacing the timer with an enemy. I think both mission types work well, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good idea to combine them.</p>


<p>Quicksave can be a sensitive topic in game design. For linear games it’s often a tough decision whether to offer quicksave at any time or save progression only at certain times or locations. Some players refuse to use a generous quicksave feature, as it could be considered cheating.</p>

<p>This is something I think turned out particularly well in Teardown - allowing just one save slot, freely available at any time during preparation, but disabled as soon as the alarm goes off. It encourages player experimentation during the preparation phase, but since there is only one slot, it must still be used wisely. Even with quicksave available, a major change of plans often requires a full restart anyway due to resource limitations, vehicle condition or broken objects.</p>

<p>Trying out a route and then go back to the planning phase for improvement is a key part of the core loop and so intrinsic to the game that we actually enforce it in the third mission to communicate that this is the intended way to play the game.</p>


<p>Since any mission can be played in an infinte number of ways there is already natural incentive for replayability, but there are a couple of things in the game specifically designed to increase replayability. Most missions have optional targets that will increase the score. These optional targets are often placed in strategic locations that break up the most efficient path of the required targets, encouraging the player to use a different strategy and/or starting location.</p>

<p>New tools and upgrades introduced later in the game make all earlier missions easier to complete. It gives a natural incentive to go back and replay missions with better tools, clearing more optional targets, which increases score and gives even better tools, forming an outer game loop that can be quite rewarding. Admittedly, for this to have a strong impact on the game, there would need to be more optional targets. However, introducing a lot of optional targets early in the game can be quite overwhelming, so the whole thing might need to be redisigned a bit to work as intended.</p>


<p>Let’s be honest - no one plays Teardown for the story, but I think it serves an important role to frame the missions and as an incentive for progression. It was an early decision to deliver the story in the form of one way e-mail communication and I’m quite happy the way it turned out. Since the player can go back and read old e-mails, it’s possible to catch up on the story when coming back after taking a break from the game. This is something I miss in a lot of other games - the ability to recap the story when coming back to them.</p>

<p>The reason e-mails cannot be replied to is part of the bigger goal of making the player fully anonymous. The main character in Teardown is intentionally lacking name, age, gender and personality traits to fully leave that up the players imagination.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2020-11-05-mail.png"><img src="http://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2020-11-05-mail.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>The story is also told through the environments, how they progress, descriptions of objects in them, themed valuables and last but not least the television. There’s a lot of room for improvements here. I originally envisioned much more environmental changes when coming back to the same environment (also involving procedural changes based on the players actions) but for several reasons we had to cut back on that.</p>

<p>Missions are kept separate from the e-mails on the Missions tab to give the player an overview of available missions for a particular location. This is to further incentivice replayability and make it clear where improvements are possible to increase score and rank.</p>


<p>Whether to have sandbox levels directly accessible or tied to campaign progression has been a long internal discussion. Knowing that a lot of people would want to play Teardown just for the sandbox experience, it may seem a bit inconsiderate to enforce a complete playthrough to make everything accessible. On the other hand, keeping all environments and tools available in sandbox mode from the beginning would ruin the experience for campaign players.</p>

<p>The route we chose was to keep them locked, but introduce new environments and tools relatively early in the campaign. The first three environments can be unlocked after completing just five missions while the fourth one requires a bit more work. While not suiting everyone, I think it turned out quite well, and I hope more people play and enjoy the campaign because of this decision.</p>

<p>Tool upgrades also carry over to the sandbox mode, which gives a stronger incentive to scavenge valuables and upgrade tools in the campaign.</p>

<p><strong><span>Update</span></strong>: We got a call this evening from someone who runs App Review. They apologized for the experience we had, then told us they've accepted our appeal and won't be removing iSH from the store tomorrow. We'll stay in contact with them to work out details. Thanks everyone for your support!
</p>


<p>On Monday, October 26th, just four days after we launched iSH on the App Store, we received a call from Apple informing us that they had found our app noncompliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines and that they would remove the app from sale if we did not submit a satisfactory update within two weeks. Despite our best efforts, we do not believe we will be able to bring iSH into compliance by tomorrow, the conclusion of this 14 day period, and we expect iSH to no longer be available to download from the App Store after that time. We are working our hardest to get iSH back on the App Store as soon as possible and hope for your understanding and support as we navigate our next steps in this process.</p>

<p>Thanks for using iSH!<br>
Theodore Dubois, Saagar Jha &amp; Martin Persson</p>

<h2 id="why-is-ish-being-removed">Why is iSH being removed?</h2>
<p>Apple believes iSH is not compliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines, which governs applications which download and run executable code. Specifically, they believe that iSH “is not self-contained and has remote package updating functionality”, and suggest that we should “remove the remote network activity functionality which could allow for remote code importing into the app, such as wget or curl, or other remote network commands”. Additional communication with Apple has indicated that they believe that iSH is a security concern if we allow any sort of code importing by the user.</p>

<p><strong>We believe iSH is fully compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines.</strong> <a href="https://saagarjha.com/blog/2020/11/08/fixing-section-2-5-2/">Saagar has written</a> a more detailed analysis of why we believe this rejection is incorrect, how we believe Apple has misinterpreted and misapplied this rule to our app, and describe how 2.5.2’s poor wording coupled with the review team being unable to review functionality of scripting applications leads to mistaken classifications like these. At a high level, Apple has selectively targeted iSH using section 2.5.2 without fullying understanding our application, their own guidelines, or the consequences of what they are asking and how they affect the App Store ecosystem as a whole. <strong>Consistent enforcement of Apple’s incorrect interpretation would require the removal of all scripting apps, including many of the most popular applications in the App Store and some of Apple’s own applications.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-done-to-get-ish-back-on-the-app-store">What have we done to get iSH back on the App Store?</h2>
<p>We’ve been working for the last two weeks to try to keep iSH available without interruptions. We have drafted numerous appeals, requests for clarifications, rule modifications, and explanatory emails. We’ve been on the phone with Apple for hours. Unfortunately, even with this we have been unable to resolve the issue, and the process has been significantly more stressful than we would have liked it to be. Theodore, the primary iSH liaison to Apple, <a href="https://tbodt.com/2020/11/08/app-review-experiences.html">has written about</a> how this process should be improved.</p>

<p>Our first interaction with the App Store review team actually dates back to May, not October: we wanted to know what Apple thought of iSH, since we weren’t sure how the rules would be enforced for it. Of course, iSH complies with the letter of the guidelines, but review found it to violate 2.5.2 because it could download Linux executable code. The problem appeared that apk lets you install packages, so we decided to remove it and work on other features to make the app more useful in its absence. We submitted this updated build in October and this was what is currently on the App Store.</p>

<p>After our build was flagged for noncompliance, we went through the usual review process: we first asked for clarification, and then after we realized that the rule was being misapplied we submitted a rule change request and of course appealed the decision as well. As the deadline approached we sent off an email to Phil Schiller as well detailing our situation. Unfortunately none of this led anywhere, which brings up to our current situation today.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-mean-i-cant-use-ish-anymore">Does this mean I can’t use iSH anymore?</h2>
<p>No, not at all. However, it will mean that you will no longer be able to get iSH from the App Store, which is something which we would still like to be able to provide. The App Store remains the easiest and most popular method of software distribution on iOS, and we’re working hard to save iSH’s listing because we think the app should have a permanent spot there for users who prefer this method of distribution.</p>

<p>Removal of iSH’s listing on the App Store should not affect your use of iSH if you download the app before it is removed. We have not received any compliance messages from Apple regarding <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O">our TestFlight beta</a>, so we plan to continue offering prerelease versions of iSH there for up to 10,000 beta testers.</p>

<p>Precompiled builds of iSH (distributed as IPA files) will <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish/releases">remain available on GitHub</a> for <a href="https://ish.app/altstore">installation through AltStore</a> and for jailbroken users. Advanced users are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish#build-for-ios">build iSH</a> themselves—it’s free and open source and always will be!</p>

<p><strong><span>Update</span>: <a href="https://twitter.com/a_Shell_iOS/status/1325526061099196416">a-Shell has mentioned</a> that they have received a similar rejection notice. Apple may be running extra review for scripting apps.</strong></p>

<![CDATA[CVE-2020-5387: Prevent a Dell XPS 9370 from booting]]>

November 8, 2020 | https://sayr.us/exploit/dell-exploit/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sayr.us/exploit/dell-exploit/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In August 2019, I’ve discovered a bug in how the XPS Bios handles a bootable
device. This bug allows an attacker with write permission to a bootable device
or physical access to the computer to prevent it from booting.</p>

<h2 id="the-bug">The bug</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vulnerability is available <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/en-us/sln322626/dsa-2020-209-dell-xps-13-9370-improper-exception-handling-vulnerability">on Dell’s website</a>
or by its <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5387">CVE Identifier</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Dell XPS reads and drops file on the primary disk during the booting and
BIOS upgrade process. Namely, it drops:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>/boot/EFI/Dell/Bios/Recovery/BIOS_PRE.rcv</code></li>
  <li><code>/boot/EFI/Dell/Bios/Recovery/BIOS_CUR.RCV</code></li>
</ol>

<p>These files are used by a process called BIOS Recovery Tool. On the XPS 9370,
<a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/en-us/sln300716/how-to-recover-the-bios-on-a-dell-computer-or-tablet">BIOS Recovery 3</a>
is used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code> is used for F2/F12 recovery.
<code>BIOS_CUR.rcv</code> is used only during the process of flash update failures. After the successful FW update <code>BIOS_CUR.rcv</code> is always copied to <code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code> is corrupted, the BIOS crashes. Triggering this bug prevents
the laptop from accessing the boot menu and accessing the BIOS. The only way to
recover from the exploit is to unplug the exploited boot device. If the exploit is
done on the internal disk, this means that you need to disassemble the laptop.</p>

<p>When “Bios Recovery from Hard Drive” is disabled, recovery (and the exploit) only works from USB stick / USB hard drive.</p>

<h2 id="a-tale-of-failure">A tale of failure</h2>

<p>This writeup is not your usual exploit writeup. I am not an experienced
attacker, especially not against a blackbox such as my laptop’s BIOS. So how did
I end up finding it?</p>

<p>It all started while I was benchmarking my laptop’s internal drive using <code>fio</code>. I
simply wrote <code>randrw</code> instead of <code>randread</code> and thus overwrote a part of my
own hard drive. This part mostly included my boot partition and the two aforementioned BIOS
files.</p>

<p>Luckily, I already had a live Arch Linux USB key to repair everything. My plan was
simple: reboot, fix, reboot. That doesn’t sound so hard!</p>

<p><img src="https://sayr.us/assets/images/20minutesadventure.jpg" alt="Reboot and fix. Twenty minutes adventure."></p>

<p>After rebooting, I could not access a single BIOS Menu. Everything either froze
on a black screen, or on “Preparing one-time boot menu”. If I was unable to boot
anything or access the BIOS setup, I was not going to be able to fix my problem.</p>

<p>At that time, I didn’t know I found a bug in the BIOS, only that I somehow
fucked up so hard that my laptop was bricked. So I contacted the Dell support,
because I should not be able to brick my laptop like this! They agreed that it
was not supposed to happen and offered me a replacement.</p>

<h3 id="backups-and-a-surprise">Backups and a surprise</h3>

<p>Before sending back my laptop, I wished to recover what I was working on as it
had yet to be pushed. So I took the NVMe out of the laptop and put it in another
machine to dump a disk image. Right after removing the NVMe, I could access the
Bios and even boot on my USB stick.</p>

<p>Was my NVMe broken? From another computer, I could access any file on it. The
boot partition was indeed corrupted but the content of the LUKS partition was
sane.</p>

<p>Well then, if it’s not hardware, is it something on the drive? I dumped a full
disk image on an external HDD, tried to boot it on my laptop and <strong>boom</strong>. I
just reproduced the bug I had earlier on another drive.</p>

<p>I couldn’t miss the chance to play with what I had found so I kept a full disk
image as a backup of my data and another as a way to trigger the bug.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-culprit">Finding the culprit</h3>

<p>Now that I had a disk image that triggered the bug, it was time to investigate.
At that point, the only information I had were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I wrote random bytes on my disk, including in the partitions table, the boot
partition, and part of my encrypted disk</li>
  <li>Something on the disk is definitely messing up with the BIOS</li>
  <li>Duplicating the disk image and plugging it in as a USB Disk triggers the bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I assumed that bytes inside my encrypted partition were not the cause as the
BIOS had no reason to read them and they were valid when read from another
computer. Hopefully, it is not broken hardware either.</p>

<h4 id="partitions-table">Partitions table</h4>

<p>My first guess was that my partitions table was invalid and something broke
while enumerating tables. For instance, I might have been listing a partition
offset outside of the disk size, or an invalid size.</p>

<p>To verify that, I created a new partition table from scratch and copied the boot
partition content (files) and tried to boot.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: <strong>Still broken.</strong></p>

<p>Even better, I did not copy my encrypted partition so the bug was definitely
triggered by something inside the boot partition!</p>

<h4 id="boot-partition">Boot partition</h4>

<p>Obviously, there was something in my boot partition that triggered the bug. But
why would the BIOS read the content of the boot partition? Silly me, I did not
know that BIOS recovery from hard drive was a thing. As far as I knew, it might
have been coming from anything: an invalid folder name, a corrupted file or even
a hard-link to an invalid INode…</p>

<p><em>Obviously not an invalid hard-link as I just did copy the files and there were
no hard-links on this new drive…</em></p>

<p>I was lacking the experience in this kind of bug so the easiest way for me was
to proceed by elimination:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Delete a folder</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Try to boot</li>
  <li>If it boots, restore only this folder, and apply Step 1 to the content of this
folder</li>
  <li>If it does not boot, simply go back to Step 1</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat</strong> until there is only a single file or folder remaining that triggers
the bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I deleted files using this method until I found out that deleting the
<code>/boot/EFI/Dell/Bios/Recovery</code> folder fixed the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed !</strong></p>

<p>At this point, I notified Dell about the bug and sent them the two files that
were triggering the bug. The BIOS being closed source, it would be time
consuming to find:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What the format of <code>BIOS_PRE.rcv</code> and <code>BIOS_CUR.rcv</code> was (looking at
Dell’s documentation, <em>it might just be a Windows executable</em>)</li>
  <li>What field in that file triggers the bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I might have been able to <code>hexdiff</code> a working file with the broken one, to
highlight the differences. However, that would not have given me a better
understanding of the issue. From there, Dell took over and we now have access to
the result of the investigation: <strong>Improper Exception Handling</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<ul>
  <li>12 August 2019: Message sent to secure@dell.com without the PoC</li>
  <li>13 August 2019: Answer from Dell asking for more details</li>
  <li>11 September 2019: Message sent to secure@dell.com with steps to reproduce,
including a small disk image and the broken files.</li>
  <li>12 September 2019: Answer from Dell with the ticket number</li>
  <li>26 September 2019: Dell confirmed the problem exists</li>
  <li>January 2020: Dell plans to try to release a patch in April</li>
  <li>April 2020: Dell plans to publish the patch end of May</li>
  <li>May 2020: Dell plans to publish the patch beginning of July</li>
  <li>19 August 2020: Bios 1.13.1 released with the patch</li>
  <li>29 September 2020: Dell notifies me a Security Advisory was published</li>
  <li>16 October 2020: Dell updates the CVE score as the CVE does not require physical access, only high privileges</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>

<p>The story might have begun as a scary <em>do your backups</em> story, but it ends without
any data-loss and with a reported vulnerability. Overall, it was a lot of fun and
a fine addition to my collection.</p>

<p>Perhaps next time we’ll talk about how to destroy the displayed image on my
monitor using only a JPEG file or making a video input detected as HDR by
squeezing the DisplayPort cable.</p>

    <h3>how we pay for software</h3>

    <p>Quality software costs money to make.</p>

    <p>The tech industry has backed itself into a corner in the last couple decades by implying to users that software doesn’t cost much. Google led the charge here, by providing a series of useful and well-made applications like Gmail, Google Maps, and its core search product for free. They aren’t free, of course: users ”pay“ with their attention and personal data for advertisements.</p>

    <p>Paying with attention and personal data is probably a good trade for search and maps, maybe less so for email. But it’s not a model that fits professional and creative tools.</p>

    <p>Here are three proven models for paying for software:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Ad-supported software.</strong> Only really appropriate for pure-consumer products that are attention-oriented to begin with (e.g. social media). Requires huge scale since <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Twitters-ARPU-average-revenue-per-user">each user is only worth a few bucks</a>. Because the user is the product rather than the customer, the user’s needs are not the priority of the business.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Software bundled with hardware or content.</strong> End users seem to be fine with paying directly for hardware (smartphone, laptop) or content (Netflix, Spotify). In these examples the software is a huge part of what you’re paying for—a Mac without macOS is just an overpriced PC, and Netflix without its excellent browsing and playback software is just cloud storage media stocked with MP4 files. Yet few people think of themselves as paying for macOS or Netflix’s app.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://adamwiggins.com/making-computers-better/spotify-pricing.png" alt="pricing page for Spotify">

      <figcaption>
        <svg width="50" height="10" viewBox="0 0 50 10" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <rect width="50" height="10" rx="2.5" fill="#298070"></rect>
        </svg>

        <p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/">Spotify’s pricing</a> demonstrates the common price range for individually-purchased subscriptions: $5/month on the low end, $15/month on the high end.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>B2B SaaS.</strong> ”Business-to-business software-as-a-service“ is a mouthful, but represents a a beautiful, pure, and simple payment model for software. A business has a problem; a software creator offers a web-based product that solves the problem; the business purchases directly from the creator, and continues to pay as long as they have the problem and the product is good. Interests are aligned, and the no-middleman nature of the web means software creators have a direct relationship with their customers. Everybody wins. That’s why there’s so many success stories here: Slack, GitHub, Mailchimp, Atlassian, Zoom, Notion, and Carta just to name a few.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I seek a world with a great diversity of lovingly-crafted software for niche audiences. But niche is not possible with ad-supported which requires huge scale to work, and hardware and content licensing have massive up-front capital costs that imply financing models not compatible with small-scale.</p>

    <p>Happily, B2B SaaS is having its <a href="https://microconf.com/">revolution for small independents</a> right now. So what’s the equivalent of that for pro creator tools like <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">video editing</a> or <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">writing</a> or <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">knowledge management</a>? Can we have something as beautiful and pure as B2B SaaS but for individuals as well as businesses, and for desktop, mobile, and other native apps?</p>

    <p>And indeed there does seem to be movement toward subscription-priced prosumer products in the $5 –&nbsp;$15/month range. See
      established players like
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/individual/plans-comparison">Dropbox</a>,
      <a href="https://evernote.com/compare-plans">Evernote</a>,
      <a href="https://ulysses.app/get/">Ulysses</a> and
      <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/buy/">OmniFocus</a>;
      plus up-and-comers like
      <a href="https://hey.com/pricing/">HEY</a>,
      <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>,
      <a href="https://www.descript.com/pricing">Descript</a>, and my own venture <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a>.

        <p><a href="https://calendly.com/pages/pricing">Calendly’s pricing</a> is similar to other prosumer products.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>As a <strike>user</strike> customer, I like the idea of finding a few great tools that empower my work and paying for them directly. That gives me confidence the product will serve my needs long-term, because I’m the customer.</p>

    <p>And this doesn’t mean a bigger budget for my tech product purchases overall: I can subtract these subscriptions from the money I previously spent on a new phone and laptop every two years, then buy new hardware a little less often. Right now I think great software is more important than hardware advances, much as I love shiny new devices.</p>

    <p>As a software creator, I love the idea of serving a niche of customers who are deeply connected with the product I’m making and get lots of value from it. It has that pure, direct, and personal relationship we see in B2B SaaS, but maybe even more initimate because these are personal tools.</p>

    <p>Ok sounds good—but now the next problem with a direct-payment model. If we’re going to make software subscriptions work, we as creators have to address the sharp edges and <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/misnomers">subscription fatigue</a> people may experience maintaining a stack of software subscriptions.</p>

    <p>Individuals are cautious about recurring billing due to poorly-designed—even <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003499613-Cancel-your-subscription">borderline scammy</a>—subscription buying, renewal, and canceling experiences. The reference worst-case scenario are gym memberships or mobile phone contracts: being trapped in a recurring payment that no longer fits your needs, and being forced to navigate a customer service maze to try to downgrade or cancel.</p>

    <p>So how can we give customers a great experience with subscriptions? A few proposals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Treat the <strong>buying experience as part of your product</strong>. Make it easy for prospective customers to see what they will get; making buying easy and fun; show them love afterward, not just a ”you’re all set“ dialog and nothing else.</p></li>
    </ul>

        <p><a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> offers <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/NlhpD">a great buying experience</a> with a minimum of fuss.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Make it <strong>easy to cancel</strong> at any moment. Canceling should be as smooth as purchasing initially. For bonus points, give a refund for any unused portion of purchased time.</p></li>
      <li><p>For longer-cycle payments (e.g. annual), give <strong>heads-up notifications before payment</strong> so that users are not surprised. Direct them on how they can cancel with just a couple of clicks. You shouldn’t want any money from someone who is no longer getting value from your product.</p></li>
    </ul>

        <p>HEY makes canceling easy: just two clicks. The confirmation dialog is clear on exactly what happens next.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
     <li><p>Don’t lock users out of their data, even if their trial runs out or their subscription ends. Make it easy to <strong>get at their data and export</strong> for use in other places.</p></li>
      <li><p>Don’t treat lapsed or canceled subscriptions as strangers or defectors. Instead, <strong>consider them alumni and offer them your respect</strong> and maybe even some extra perks. They’ve been customers in the past, so be thankful for that. Remember they might return as a customer in the future or refer other potential customers.</p></li>

        <p>Slack delights and surprises with their <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/218915077-Fair-Billing-Policy">fair billing policy</a>.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Beyond prosumer subscriptions, I’m happy to see products experimenting with models appropriate to their domain, like the ski app <a href="https://twitter.com/parrots/status/1314192830500347906">Slopes offering</a> packs of day passes; time-based notes app <a href="https://medium.com/@drewmccormack/cash-cow-revisited-4c2185e2b3d8">Agenda</a> with feature unlock based on subscription time windows; and <a href="https://www.komoot.com/product">Komoot</a> with hiking region budles for sale.</p>

    <p>One last one I find especially promising is the half-crowdfunding, half-early-purchase model that’s seen success with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/earlyaccessfaq/?snr=1_200_200_Early+Access">video games</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/kickstarter-film-projects/">films</a>, and <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/about">typefaces</a>. This blurs the distinctions between customer, investor, and donor. When you buy a Steam Early Access game you’re saying not just ”I want to purchase this product“ but also ”I believe in this product and the team behind it; I want it to exist; and I’m willing to risk a bit of my money to make that happen.“ And maybe: ”I like getting to give early feedback and influence the outcome of the finished product.“ <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/support/">Wikipedia with its pure patronage model</a> and <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">Are.na with its earnings transparency</a> are variations on this theme.</p>

    <p><strong>The world we have:</strong> Almost all software is paid for by (1) ads and selling personal data (2) bundling software with hardware or content or (3) business-purchased subscriptions. As a result, the type of software we have is limited to what will fit in those boxes.</p>

    <p><strong>The world I want:</strong> A wide diversity of funding and payment models for pure software products. Prosumer subscriptions are commonplace; users feel great about buying tools that matter to them; and they get a great experience when buying and canceling. Crowdfunding, patronage, and many other models flourish and individual products can choose the model that best fits them and their customers.</p>

	<div>

		<p><span>During recent research into the life of Machiavelli something began to become quite clear to me. We weren’t always, universally, socially, communally or even personally, political. That is to say, it’s only recently that it’s become commonplace to declare oneself as left, right, Republican, Democrat, Labour, Conservative, Centrist, Reactionary, Socialist, Red, Blue, x-pilled, y-pilled etc. In terms of human history this way of </span><span><em><span>being</span></em></span><span> – as a political-being, or even as homo-politicus – is </span><span><em><span>extremely</span></em></span><span> new. The very idea of a left/right split/spectrum comes from where people sat during the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly divided themselves into those in support of the king (right) and supporters of the Revolution (left). Arguably this is one and only time that the idea of a left/right spectrum has ever made sense. Since then </span><span><em><span>both</span></em></span><span> ‘directions’ signal virtue to various camps and striate one into relatively specific ways of thinking. The year we’re roughly talking about here is 1789, that’s round that all up and say – for clarity’s sake – we’ve been political ‘beings’ for just over 200 years. Once again, humans in their current evolutionary iteration have been around for 200,000 years. So we’ve had this political chip on our shoulders for roughly 0.1% of our entire lifetime. Of course, you could argue that for a large amount of that time we haven’t exactly had the infrastructure to allow for what we now commonly understand as politics or political economy, but we </span><span><em><span>have</span></em></span><span> had that for a few thousand years at least, so even going by that metric, the notion of a political-being or of a political-human is still quite new. </span></p>
<p><span>It seems to me the reason for the original (non) position, wherein man wasn’t apolitical, nor anti-political, but simply detached from the political, wasn’t due to some oppression (though some would argue otherwise)[1], nor was it really to do with any ignorance; it was largely because in relation to man’s daily life, the specific political on-goings didn’t matter to him. I would argue that this is still true, we’re just all caught up in status and popularity games. </span></p>
<p><span>The very idea that within contemporary (Western) society one could be ‘detached’ from politics seems absurd, that’s how tight of a grasp it has on our lives. A grasp which is ever-tightened by the popular rhetoric surrounding politics. Society in general seems to unconsciously believe that they now have some kind of duty to </span><span><em><span>be</span></em></span><span> political, they must be in a certain camp, they must have certain opinions on various matters, and most of all, they must </span><span><em><span>care</span></em></span><span> in a specifically political way. I’m here to say that this way of thinking and being is complete bullshit, and it slowly leads one to misery and submission. There are a lot of factors as to why someone might feel compelled to constantly </span><span><em><span>be</span></em></span><span> political, largely emanating from one’s perpetual attachment to media. The two most heinous forms of media are – of course – social and mainstream. Primarily because, once you actually begin to think about what these terms actually mean, like most things in modernity, they no longer make any sense whatsoever. Let’s begin with ‘social media’.</span></p>
<p><span>We all apparently ‘know’ what social media is, which is another way of saying we understand it. I’ll admit, I don’t really understand social media, and I never have. The basic reasons as to why it’s so popular are of course clear, on average humans quite like attention, they quite like having a say and they quite like boasting about their lives. However, I would ask this? If it wasn’t </span><span><em><span>for</span></em></span><span> social media, and its invasive societally pressuring structures, would you actually </span><span><em><span>want</span></em></span><span> to express certain opinions? Would you even have them? Would you have even thought about them? Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn’t, be honest with yourself. If no one was looking, and you had no proof anyone </span><span><em><span>had</span></em></span><span> looked, would you expend energy on the various political and social tasks you do? Ok, so this then begs the question, why the hell </span><span><em><span>do</span></em></span><span> we want to express these opinions? Well, for that you need a mainstream current which tells you the correct, conventional and confirmative way to </span><span><em><span>be.</span></em></span><span> Enter the mainstream media. Such an idea of a ‘mainstream’ is already idiotic. There can’t be such a thing because we all live in different areas of the world, within different cultures, within different families, with different values, within different contexts, and so, the job the mainstream media then is to subsume all of these alternative ways of being and differing value systems into one relatively homogenous lump, which is then there’s to mold as they wish. I’d insert here Ted Kaczynski’s ‘critique’ of ‘multiculturalism’, though it’s less a critique and more of a deconstruction. Kaczynski’s point is that there isn’t really any such thing as ‘multiculturalism’ as it’s sold to us. The overt idea is that multiple diverse cultures live amongst one another, learn from each other and share their cultures for the betterment of all. Kaczynski makes it clear that this is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> what happens within contemporary multiculturalism, all that really happens is that every culture is subsumed into the exact same culture of middle-class consumerist aspiration, and perhaps allowed to retain any cultural aesthetic which might be deemed profitable by their new culture of consumerist aspiration. The exact same thing happens with mainstream media. One begins with a variety of views, opinions, values, outlooks, perspectives and contexts which have been grown organically, from their local surroundings and upbringing, these are then pushed through the conformity thresher of mainstream media, cherry-picked for their applicability for submission, and what’s left are deemed dangerous, archaic, bad, fascist, radical, silly, absurd, weird, not-normal, odd or perhaps just too common-sensical for them to remain.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the </span><span><em><span>exact</span></em></span><span> same process happens with the idea of a ‘political-human’ with a few minor alterations. Much like homo-criminalis, or homo-economicus, once the suffix is assumed </span><span><em><span>a priori</span></em></span><span> as a </span><span><em><span>way</span></em></span><span> of being – man </span><span><em><span>can</span></em></span><span> be a criminal, or man </span><span><em><span>can</span></em></span><span> be economical. There’s no longer such a thing as a man detached entirely from criminality or the economy, there is only a man who is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> a criminal, or a man who acts within the economy in a </span><span><em><span>different</span></em></span><span> way than what is preferred. The exact same thing happens with political man. Once a political-outlook, a political-perspective or a political-reality is assumed as the given reality, everything is then filtered through politics in some manner. Then there is no longer such a thing as a entirely unpolitical man, only a man who is deemed ignorant of politics, someone who is seen as turning a blind eye or as simply too lazy to investigate that which they </span><span><em><span>should</span></em></span><span> be. The language here is the problem. Foucault makes this point clear with homo-criminalis and homo-economicus, once the ontology is taken as a given, no one is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> of it, but simply seen as not part of a certain section of it. Men are not men, they are either criminals or </span><span><em><span>not-</span></em></span><span>criminals, we are not ourselves we are either economizing or </span><span><em><span>not-</span></em></span><span>economizing, either way, we’re still tethered to a way of being we had no say in.</span></p>
<p><span>Well I’m here to say that this is complete and utter crap. If you want to go get involved in politics, then be my guest, but do NOT assume that just because I don’t care about a certain topic, opinion or perspective that I am immediately the antagonist of that position. There is a difference between a hostile apathy, in which one truly doesn’t care about the plight of others and a detachment within one simply is not involved. Of course, any </span><span><em><span>involved</span></em></span><span> are going to disagree. ‘It’s your duty!’ they will cry. ‘Do you not care about the world!’ they will shriek. ‘How can you just do nothing?’ they will plead. Actually, I am doing something, I’m not expending my energy on a status game which largely exists to inflate various egos and create jobs. Lest we forget that politicians are </span><span><em><span>workers</span></em></span><span>, to be a politician is a </span><span><em><span>job</span></em></span><span>, and by the looks of it, quite a cushy one at that. </span></p>
<p><span>Being </span><span><em><span>detached</span></em></span><span> from politics isn’t </span><span><em><span>not caring</span></em></span><span> about those things you left behind, in fact, it’s arguably the opposite. As soon as a charitable organization, a communal effort or a group event becomes politicized, I am instantly skeptical of its agenda, why? Well, because since when did helping others, loving thy neighbor or creating something helpful </span><span><em><span>have</span></em></span><span> to be seen through a political lens. Call me a soppy-sod, but buying a homeless person some food, donating to a local charity or helping out in a local event isn’t – and doesn’t have to be – a specifically political move or motivation, and if it is, you’re doing so to cater to your own narcissism. What </span><span><em><span>are</span></em></span><span> these acts then? Well, they are what they are. You help someone because they need help, you do something because it needs doing, you create because something needs creating; once sincere acts are filtered through the malicious gauze of politics they are usually lost entirely, abused into a self-congratulatory mutation. </span></p>
<p><span>Ok, maybe you’re with me, but you’re starting to think…’Ok, so what do I…</span><span><em><span>do?</span></em></span><span>‘ Isn’t that the point? Up until now, for many people, each and every act they undertook was done primarily from a political position as opposed to the multitude of other (healthier) perspectives that exist. What do you do? Do what you’d like and what you understand to be right. </span></p>
<p><span>“Ah yes Meta, but if we ‘do nothing’ as you propose, wont we be simply bolstering support for whichever party is in the running to win?” You’re still thinking politically, why does it </span><span><em><span>actually</span></em></span><span> matter to you? If I support X I’ve entered into a system which is so unfathomably corrupt, confused and rife with personality that I will never </span><span><em><span>truly</span></em></span><span> know what it is my vote is doing. It is NOT an apathy, an ignorance or a superiority. It is a detachment. It is one unclipping themselves from a perspective they never asked for in the first place. The years upon years spent drooling …</span></p></div></article></div>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on November 08, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's Python blog post is about building a command line tool for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to parse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> using Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">xml.etree.ElementTree</a> module.</li>
<li>How to traverse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a> queries.</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a> to parse macro definitions.</li>
<li>How to use string methods to normalize text.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate programming</a> is a programming paradigm created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>.
Dr. Knuth, Professor Emeritus at Stanford University, is better known as the
creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a> (see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>) and the book series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">"The Art of
Computer Programming"</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of literate programming is to allow programs to be displayed in a
narrative order -- as opposed to being limited by the constraints of a compiler
or interpreter.
Literate programming tools allow writers to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)">macros</a> to abstract
and reorder source code to best suit the narrative.</p>
<p>There are two things to do with a literate program:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <strong>tangle</strong> the literate program into source code -- which can then be
compiled and executed.</li>
<li>Or, you can <strong>weave</strong> the literate program into documentation -- which can be
read.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a sample literate program for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Khan's Algorithm</a>:</p>

</blockquote>
<pre><code># Topological Sort with Khan's Algorithm

``` &lt;&lt;MAIN&gt;&gt;=
&lt;&lt;imports&gt;&gt;

def khans_algorithm(*, V, E):
    &lt;&lt; init graph &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; init topological order &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; init source nodes &gt;&gt;
    
    while &lt;&lt; source nodes exist &gt;&gt;:
        &lt;&lt; take source node &gt;&gt;
        &lt;&lt; add node to topological order &gt;&gt;
        &lt;&lt; add neighboring source nodes &gt;&gt;
    
    if &lt;&lt; edges remain &gt;&gt;:
        raise &lt;&lt; cycle error &gt;&gt;
    else:
        return &lt;&lt; topological order &gt;&gt;
```

I initialize the graph indices from vertices `V` and edges `E`:

``` &lt;&lt; init graph &gt;&gt;=
E_idx0 = defaultdict(set)
E_idx1 = defaultdict(set)

def index(n, m):
    E_idx0[n].add(m)
    E_idx1[m].add(n)

def deindex(n, m):
    E_idx0[n].remove(m)
    E_idx1[m].remove(n)

def indegree(n):
    return len(E_idx1[n])

def outdegree(n):
    return len(E_idx0[n])

def is_source(n):
    return indegree(n) == 0

for n, m in E:
    index(n, m)
```

I use the `indegree` and `outdegree` helper functions to determine
whether any edges remain:

``` &lt;&lt; edges remain &gt;&gt;=
any((indegree(n) &gt; 0) or (outdegree(n) &gt; 0) for n in V)
```

I represent the topological order as a list:

``` &lt;&lt; topological order &gt;&gt;=
L
```

``` &lt;&lt; init topological order &gt;&gt;=
&lt;&lt; topological order &gt;&gt; = []
```

``` &lt;&lt; add node to topological order &gt;&gt;=
&lt;&lt; topological order &gt;&gt;.append(n)
```

I represent the source nodes as a set:

``` &lt;&lt; source nodes &gt;&gt;=
S
```

``` &lt;&lt; init source nodes &gt;&gt;=
&lt;&lt; source nodes &gt;&gt; = set(filter(is_source, V))
```

``` &lt;&lt; take source node &gt;&gt;=
n = &lt;&lt; source nodes &gt;&gt;.pop()
```

``` &lt;&lt; source nodes exist &gt;&gt;=
len(&lt;&lt; source nodes &gt;&gt;) &gt; 0
```

Given a node, I use the graph indices to find the
neighboring source nodes:

``` &lt;&lt; neighbors &gt;&gt;=
tuple(E_idx0[n])
```

``` &lt;&lt; add neighboring source nodes &gt;&gt;=
for m in &lt;&lt; neighbors &gt;&gt;:
    deindex(n, m)
    if is_source(m):
        &lt;&lt; source nodes &gt;&gt;.add(m)
```

If the graph contains a cycle, I will raise an exception:

``` &lt;&lt; cycle error &gt;&gt;=
RuntimeError("Graph contains a cycle.")
```

Here are the required imports:

``` &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;=
from collections import defaultdict
```

<p>To write literate programs, I use <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, a style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>.
I turn this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> file into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> using the <code>cmark</code> command line tool:</p>
<pre><code>$ cmark --to xml sample.markdown &gt; sample.xml
</code></pre>
<p>To support macro definitions, I use the "info strings" on fenced code blocks. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ echo '
``` hello world
a 
b
```
' | cmark --to xml

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s no secret that this year has been a testing year on all fronts of our waking lives, leading us to ‘get out of our comfort zones’ and learn to adapt in vastly changing times. Subsequently, most employees have had to work remotely to some capacity (if not fully remotely), and we’ve all had to learn how to improve our work-life balance while finding new ways to still be as efficient as before in our professional lives.</p><p>Needless to say, today you do not need to be tech-savvy to adjust to the digital world. The key to surviving and succeeding in this world is to make sure you’re prepared with the necessary online tools, mindset, and time management skills.</p><p>Below is a list of tips to help you thrive in a digital workforce:</p><h2>1. Make sure you have a strong internet connection</h2><p>This may seem like a no-brainer, but possibly the first thing you need to make sure you have when working remotely is a strong internet connection. This will help ensure you’re always accessible to your colleagues, therefore able to carry out your daily tasks and duties without interruption. Depending on your household and the number of devices you have connected to your WIFI, you may need to upgrade your internet package so you have a fast and reliable connection.</p><p>Just as in the traditional work environment, it’s important to collaborate with your co-workers and management, and poor internet connection may hinder that. Luckily, most service providers provide affordable internet bundle packages that will cater to your needs without breaking your bank balance.</p><h2>2. Invest in good office furniture and computer equipment</h2><p>Following some basic, yet essential ergonomics tips can improve your efficiency, reduce fatigue and strain to your back and neck, and facilitate proper posture. That’s why it’s important to invest in comfortable and adjustable furniture just as much as it is to have reliable computer equipment and updated software to complete your home office setup.</p><p>When working an eight-hour day or more, maintaining proper posture while sitting is crucial, not only for immediate benefits but for long-term damage you may cause to your back if you do not adopt the correct seating posture with adequate lower back support. Adjustable chairs and tables are a must-have to help ease pressure and body discomfort while working.</p><p>What often goes overlooked is the importance of taking care of your eyes. Protect your eyes from digital eye strain with an anti-blue light screen protector for your laptop or display monitor and you’ll disrupt the chances of sleep deprivation, fatigue, and risk of macular degeneration.</p><h2>3. Have a dedicated workspace</h2><p>Apart from helping you curb unnecessary distractions from the TV, social media, or dare I say: your kids, having a dedicated workspace is necessary to help improve productivity and creativity. Usually, when you go to the office it’s easier to get into ‘work-mode’ since you’re in an environment that induces productivity, but when working from home, you have to put in a little more effort to stay focused and motivated. Avoid working from your bed, the couch, or anywhere else that may lead to inattentiveness and interruptions to the work at hand.</p><p>Working remotely is a benefit that requires both accountability and responsibility as an employee, so creating an environment that promotes efficiency<strong></strong>goes a long way. Even if you don’t have the luxury of having an actual office at home you can still dedicate a certain ‘work-zone’ (preferably close to a window so you can enjoy the benefits of fresh air and natural light) in a quiet part of your home.</p><h2>4. Take breaks</h2><p>Don’t be hesitant to take breaks during the day. Taking regular short breaks will help keep your productivity at a high as well as help you feel constantly recharged and engaged. These could include short breaks to meditate for 5-10 minutes, having coffee, stretching, or simply just walking around to increase your blood circulation. Incorporate the 20-20-20 rule into your schedule: Take a 20-second break every 20 minutes by looking at things at least 20 feet away.</p><p>You can set reminders on your phone to help you remember to get up and walk. You can even get creative and strategic in your approach and place certain equipment (like the printer for instance) in another room to necessitate getting up and walking.</p><h2>5. Keep learning and improving your skills.</h2><p>Continuously upgrading your knowledge and skills will not only help keep you relevant in your respective field but will also help you map out your career progression. In an ever-changing job market and surplus in demand for remote work, you need to be marketable to progress. The more skilled and experienced you are, the wider your opportunities and growth prospects.</p><p>There are amazing free online learning materials you can take advantage of, or find reasonably affordable online courses. Even reading books on self-improvement, motivation, and success will help to keep you driven and inspired.</p><h2>6. Engage with colleagues and maintain positive professional relationships</h2><p>One of the downsides of working remotely is that you lose the benefits of building rapport with colleagues and your managers, which can result in life-long and beneficial professional connections.</p><p>You spend 8 hours of the day working, so it’s important to have healthy relations with the people you work with so that you feel level-headed and motivated to work. Something as simple as a good morning message to using professional and friendly jargon to communicate will help facilitate solid and positive relationships.</p><p>Be proactive and participate actively in meetings, after-work activities (provided you’re protecting yourself and others by social distancing and wearing a mask), and any other engagement activities offered. Be mindful to respect each other's diversities but also know when to not distract your co-workers as you must always maintain a professional demeanor. This will help to build trust, mutual respect, and open communication amongst each other, and bring about teamwork.</p><h2>7. Disconnect and know when to ‘call it a day’</h2><p>Time is valuable, and so are you! In order to be the best employee you can be, you need to learn to take care of yourself and your health, including your mental health. In a cut-throat work environment where we’re constantly being graded on our performance, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and work to an excess.</p><p>Follow a strict work schedule but know when it’s time to ‘switch off’ and relax. If you find yourself unable to disconnect, practice managing your time better throughout the day so you’re able to finish your work on time. This will help reduce stress and improve the quality of your sleep.</p><p>Working overtime is necessary in certain cases, but downfall into the trap where you don’t give yourself (and your family and loved ones) the time to live and enjoy your life. Remember, the most productive employees are the ones who are well-rested and feel motivated to work.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Multiple well-funded teams in crypto are studying ancient human history to design new methods for securing the cryptographic keys for holding cryptocurrencies. </p>



<p>“Material that we have interpreted from ancient rocks prove that the methods we use today are already very close to the solution. Some of these techniques are hundreds of thousands of years old, so this is a significant undertaking” opined John Keymaker, Head of Research at GoldenKeys, a startup focused on innovative methods to secure crypto.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>When "progress" is backwards</h2>

<p>20 Oct 2020 15:58 UTC</p>
<p>Lately I see many developments in the linux FOSS world that sell themselves as progress, but are actually hugely annoying and counter-productive.</p>

<p>Counter-productive to a point where they actually cause major regressions, costs, and as in the case of GTK+3 ruin user experience and the possibility that we'll ever enjoy "The year of the Linux desktop".</p>

<h2>Showcase 1: GTK+3</h2>

<p>GTK+2 used to be <em>the</em> GUI toolkit for Linux desktop applications.
It is highly customizable, reasonably lightweight and programmable from C, which means almost any scripting language can interface to it too.</p>

<p>Rather than improving the existing toolkit code in a backwards-compatible manner, <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/">its developers</a> decided to introduce many breaking API changes which require a major porting effort to make an existing codebase compatible with the successor GTK+3, and keeping support for GTK+2 while supporting GTK+3 at the same time typically involves a lot of #ifdef clutter in the source base which not many developers are willing to maintain.</p>

<p>Additionally GTK+3 made away with a lot of user-customizable themeing options, effectively rendering useless most of the existing themes that took considerable developer effort for their creation.
Here's a <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/gtk3-regressions-from-a-gtk2-perspective/19511">list of issues</a> users are complaining about.</p>

<p>Due to the effort required to port a GTK+2 application to use GTK+3, many finished GUI application projects will never be ported due to lack of manpower, lost interest of the main developer or his untimely demise.
An example of such a program is the excellent audio editor <a href="http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/">sweep</a> which has seen its last release in 2008.
With Linux distros removing support for GTK+2, these apps are basically lost in the void of time.</p>

<p>The other option for distros is to keep both the (unmaintained) GTK+2 and GTK+3 in their repositories so GTK+2-only apps can still be used, however that causes the user of these apps to require basically the double amount of disk and RAM space as both toolkits need to live next to each other. Also this will only work as long as there are no breaking changes in the Glib library which both toolkits are built upon.</p>

<p>Even worse, due to the irritation the GTK+3 move caused to developers, many switched to QT4 or QT5, which requires use of C++, so a typical linux distro now has a mix of GTK+2, GTK+3, GTK+4, QT4 and QT5 applications, where each toolkit consumes considerable resources.</p>

<p>Microsoft (TM) knows better and sees backwards compatibility as the holy grail and underlying root cause of its success and market position. Any 25 year old Win32 GUI application from the Win95 era still works without issues on the latest Windows (TM) release. They even still support 16bit MS-DOS apps using some built-in emulator.</p>

<p>From MS' perspective, the freedesktop.org decision makers played into their hands when they decided to make GTK+3 a completely different beast.
Of course, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">taught to never believe in malice but in stupidity</a>, so it is unthinkable that there was actually a real conspiracy and monetary compensations behind this move.
Otherwise we would be conspiracy theorist nuts, right ?</p>

<h2>Showcase 2: python3</h2>

<p>Python is a hugely successful programming/scripting language used by probably millions of programmers.</p>

<p>Whereas python2 development has been very stable for many years, python3 changes at the blink of an eye. It's not uncommon to find that after an update of python3 to the next release, existing code no longer works as expected.</p>

<p>Many developers such as myself prefer to use a stable development environment over one that is as volatile as python3.</p>

<p>With the decision to <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-announce-list@python.org/thread/OFCIETIXLX34X7FVK5B5WPZH22HXV342/">EOL python2</a> thousands of py2-based applications will experience the same fate as GTK+2 applications without maintainer: they will be rendered obsolete and disappear from the distro repositories. This may happen quicker than one would expect, as python by default provides bindings to the system's OpenSSL library, which has a history of making backwards-incompatible changes. At the very least, once the web agrees on a new TLS standard, python2 will be rendered completely useless.</p>

<p>Porting python2 to python3 isn't usually as involving as GTK+2 to GTK+3, but due to the dynamic nature of python the syntax checker can't catch all code issues automatically so many issues will be experienced at runtime in cornercases, causing the ported application to throw a backtrace and stopping execution, which can have grave consequences.</p>

<p>Many companies have <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/jpmorgans-athena-has-35-million-lines-of-python-code-and-wont-be-updated-to-python-3-in-time/">millions of line of code still in python2</a> and will have to produce quite some sweat and expenses to make it compatible to python3.</p>

<h2>Showcase 3: ip vs ifconfig</h2>

<p>Once one had learned his handful of ifconfig and route commands to configure a Linux' box network connections, one could comfortably manage this aspect across all distros. Not any longer, someone had the glorious idea to declare ifconfig and friends obsolete and provide a new, more "powerful" tool to do its job: <code>ip</code>.</p>

<p>The command for bringing up a network device is now <code>ip link set dev eth1 up</code> vs the older <code>ifconfig eth1 up</code>. Does this really look like progress?
Worst, the documentation of the tool is non-intuitive so one basically has to google for examples that show the translation from one command to the other.</p>

<p>The same critics apply to <code>iw</code> vs <code>iwconfig</code>.</p>

<h2>Showcase 4: ethernet adapter renaming by systemd/udev</h2>

<p>Latest systemd-based distros come up with network interface names such as <code>enx78e7d1ea46da</code> or <code>vethb817d6a</code>, instead of the traditional <code>eth0</code>.
The interface names assigned by default on Ubuntu 20 are so long a regular human can't even remember them, any configuration attempt requires one to copy/paste the name from <code>ip a</code> output.
Yet almost every distro goes along with this <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/">Poettering/freedesktop.org-dictated</a> nonsense.</p>

<h2>Showcase 5: CMake, meson, and $BUILDSYSTEMOFTHEDAY</h2>

<p>While the traditional buildsystem used on UNIX, <code>autoconf</code>, has its warts, it was designed in such a way that only the application developer required the full set of tools, whereas the consumer requires only a POSIX compatible shell environment and a <code>make</code> program.</p>

<p>More "modern" build systems like <code>cmake</code> and <code>meson</code> don't give a damn about the dependencies a user has to install, in fact according to <a href="https://kevstras.com/programming/2017/12/18/meson.html">this</a>, <code>meson</code> authors claimed it to be one of their goals to force users to have a bleeding edge version of python3 installed so it can be universally assumed as a given.</p>

<p><code>CMake</code> is written in C++, consists of 70+ MB of extracted sources and requires an impressive amount of time to build from source. Built with debug information, it takes up 434 MB of my harddisk space as of version 3.9.3.
It's primary raison-d'etre is its support for the Microsoft (TM) Visual Studio (R) (TM) solution files, so Windows (TM) people can compile stuff from source with a few clicks.</p>

<p>The two of them have in common that they threw over board the well-known user interface to configure and make and invented their own NIH solution, which requires the user to learn yet another way to build his applications.</p>

<p>Both of these build systems seem to have either acquired a cult following just like systemd, or someone is paying trolls to show up on github with pull requests to replace GNU autoconf with either of those, for example <a href="https://github.com/containers/crun/issues/495">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/pull/968">2</a> .
Interestingly also, GNOME, which is tightly connected to freedesktop.org, has made it one of its goals to <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting">switch all components to meson</a>.
Their porting effort involves almost every key component in the Linux desktop stack, including cairo, pango, fontconfig, freetype, and dozens of others. What might be the agenda behind this effort?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We live in an era where in the FOSS world one constantly has to relearn things, switch to new, supposedly "better", but more bloated solutions, and is generally left with the impression that someone is pulling the rug from below one's feet.
Many of the key changes in this area have been rammed through by a small set of decision makers, often closely related to Red Hat/Gnome/freedesktop.org.
We're buying this "progress" at a high cost, and one can't avoid asking oneself whether there's more to the story than meets the eye.
Never forget, Red Hat and Microsoft (TM) are <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/partners/microsoft">partners</a> and might even have the same shareholders.</p>

Doing this is tricky in a React app that uses server side rendering (SSR) because client and server rendering work quite differently: Client render is async so data can be loaded inside components when they render, but server render is completely synchronous - the data must be loaded before render happens.</p><p data-reactid="57">Data loading is, of course, async. The client component-centric data loading pattern is nice, but it's incompatible with synchronous server render. React simply has no mechanism to wait for data to load when components render on SSR. There's a further problem too: React also provides no built-in way to hydrate data loaded during SSR into client state on first render. This is also up to you to implement.</p><p data-reactid="58">So, full stack data loading in React is a tricky problem. A couple of solutions have emerged:</p><ol data-reactid="59"><li data-reactid="60"><p data-reactid="61">Load data at the route level, instead of the component level, then pass data to all components under the route. Works on SSR since the route is known in the request, so data can be loaded before render begins. Can be implemented by piecing together router and state manager libraries.</p></li><li data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">Use a framework that wraps React and abstracts the problem away, perhaps by providing a framework-specific async data loading function for components that works on SSR, and also takes care of hydrating state on the client.</p></li></ol><p data-reactid="64">React Frontload aims to provide a third way - the component-centric data loading pattern available full stack, but without having to buy into a whole framework just to get this feature. It's just a small library that solves this one problem, and can be used in any React stack.</p><p data-reactid="68">Here's an example of loading data into a component with React Frontload</p><p><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

Nick is a great dude, not only because of how helpful and knowledgeable he is but because of his willingness to explain the fundamentals of CAD and engineering until one deeply understands it.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s become a routine when I finish the assignments, we talk about life, economics, psychology, and anything that comes our way. In our conversation, the topic of competition came up.&nbsp;</p><p>He tells me when he applied to colleges, he avoided the “famous” and “prestigious” places from the East Coast because of the overfocus on competition, and the lack of focus on what you’re genuinely curious about.&nbsp;</p><p>He says, “Students don’t do what they like or what they want to learn more about, rather they tend to do what they’re good at because the school, parents, friends, etc tell them to.”</p><p>As soon as he said that, sparks started happening in my head, and I was ready to share my response about the dangers of competition.&nbsp;</p><p>Competition is great [1], yet I avoid it as much as possible. Competing with others can lead you to an unhealthy path where you end up doing what you thought would make you a winner, and not what would make you enjoy what you do.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick tells me that often being the best and competing with others can often lead to putting other people down. In zero-sum games, if I win, that means you have to lose. There are plenty of cases where it's positive-sum, where no one wins at someone else’s expense.&nbsp;</p><p>I avoid competition [2] because if you want what other people want 1) it becomes harder to get what you want, and 2) even if you win or get what you wanted, you may realize that was not what you wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t have to be this way, as there are many alternatives to thrive without putting other people down and doing things you want to do by following your curiosity and interests.&nbsp;</p><p>How?</p><p><strong>You uniquely define what you do in a way that no one else is doing it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you are passionate about entrepreneurship, you can’t call yourself an “entrepreneur.” You need to go deeper. For instance, if you are an entrepreneur, define the areas, the people who you work with, where you work, how you work, and why you work.&nbsp;</p><p>You might be an entrepreneur focused on the well-being of the environment and human life in the southern parts of the country who is trying to implement Algae-based biofuel on tractors. That’s specific and you can go even deeper like the states, the brand of the tractors, and the type of algae.&nbsp;</p><p>Or if you like writing, you can’t call yourself a “writer.” See within and start unburying. You could write about how the sophisticated Roman city of Pompeii affected how we think about building and designing cities in the 20th and 21st centuries.&nbsp;</p><p>I know you may feel uncomfortable being that specific because you may think: 1) You’re passionate about more topics, 2) You may lose opportunities, 3) You may not like being that specific.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly, that’s how I feel too. However, I can define what I do in such a unique way so I can see where to go or what to do. I don’t have to follow it and can always change it. In my case, I didn’t even worry about it, and I followed what interested me and what seemed curious.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve realized that following your genuine curiosity is the best way to avoid competition and win (whatever that means for you).&nbsp;</p><p>I followed my curiosity and I can look back at the essays. Although they may seem like different topics, they all have one purpose: making my readers more optimistic, ambitious, and curious.&nbsp;</p><p>Define what you do uniquely so you have no competition. That way, you’ll win without winning and without other people down.&nbsp;</p><p>And that was only ten minutes of one of my chats with Nick. Our conversations get more interesting every week. If you’d like to hear more about them, join hundreds of people in the <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong><em>Weekly Memos</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>[1] I’m not talking about “Market Competition.” I’m referring to competition at a personal and an individual level.</p><p>[2] I don’t just avoid competition for the sake of avoiding it. But if I find myself competing for no reason, it could be a sign that I’m not thinking for myself. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604669904171_5110"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my <a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Weekly Memos</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

  <br>
</p>

<p>This year, we saw a dazzling application of machine learning. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">The OpenAI GPT-2</a> exhibited impressive ability of writing coherent and passionate essays that exceed what we anticipated current language models are able to produce. The GPT-2 wasn’t a particularly novel architecture – it’s architecture is very similar to the decoder-only transformer. The GPT2 was, however, a very large, transformer-based language model trained on a massive dataset. In this post, we’ll look at the architecture that enabled the model to produce its results. We will go into the depths of its self-attention layer. And then we’ll look at applications for the decoder-only transformer beyond language modeling.</p>

<p>My goal here is to also supplement my earlier post, <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">The Illustrated Transformer</a>, with more visuals explaining the inner-workings of transformers, and how they’ve evolved since the original paper. My hope is that this visual language will hopefully make it easier to explain later Transformer-based models as their inner-workings continue to evolve.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-language-model">What is a Language Model</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">The Illustrated Word2vec</a>, we’ve looked at what a language model is – basically a machine learning model that is able to look at part of a sentence and predict the next word. The most famous language models are smartphone keyboards that suggest the next word based on what you’ve currently typed.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/word2vec/swiftkey-keyboard.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>In this sense, we can say that the GPT-2 is basically the next word prediction feature of a keyboard app, but one that is much larger and more sophisticated than what your phone has. The GPT-2 was trained on a massive 40GB dataset called WebText that the OpenAI researchers crawled from the internet as part of the research effort. To compare in terms of storage size, the keyboard app I use, SwiftKey, takes up 78MBs of space. The smallest variant of the trained GPT-2, takes up 500MBs of storage to store all of its parameters. The largest GPT-2 variant is 13 times the size so it could take up more than 6.5 GBs of storage space.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-sizes.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>One great way to experiment with GPT-2 is using the <a href="https://gpt2.apps.allenai.org/?text=Joel%20is">AllenAI GPT-2 Explorer</a>. It uses GPT-2 to display ten possible predictions for the next word (alongside their probability score). You can select a word then see the next list of predictions to continue writing the passage.</p>

<h3 id="transformers-for-language-modeling">Transformers for Language Modeling</h3>

<p>As we’ve seen in The <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">Illustrated Transformer</a>, the original transformer model is made up of an encoder and decoder – each is a stack of what we can call transformer blocks. That architecture was appropriate because the model tackled machine translation  – a problem where encoder-decoder architectures have been successful in the past.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-encoder-decoder.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>A lot of the subsequent research work saw the architecture shed either the encoder or decoder, and use just one stack of transformer blocks – stacking them up as high as practically possible, feeding them massive amounts of training text, and throwing vast amounts of compute at them (hundreds of thousands of dollars to train some of these language models, likely millions in the case of <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/">AlphaStar</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt-2-transformer-xl-bert-3.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>How high can we stack up these blocks? It turns out that’s one of the main distinguishing factors between the different GPT2 model sizes:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-sizes-hyperparameters-3.png">
  <br>
</p>

<h3 id="one-difference-from-bert">One Difference From BERT</h3>
<blockquote>
<strong>First Law of Robotics</strong><br>
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
</blockquote>

<p>The GPT-2 is built using transformer decoder blocks. BERT, on the other hand, uses transformer encoder blocks. We will examine the difference in a following section. But one key difference between the two is that GPT2, like traditional language models, outputs one token at a time. Let’s for example prompt a well-trained GPT-2 to recite the first law of robotics:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/gpt-2-output.gif">
  <br>
</p>

<p>The way these models actually work is that after each token is produced, that token is added to the sequence of inputs. And that new sequence becomes the input to the model in its next step. This is an idea called “auto-regression”. This is one of the ideas that <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">made RNNs unreasonably effective</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/gpt-2-autoregression-2.gif">
  <br>
</p>

<p>The GPT2, and some later models like TransformerXL and XLNet are auto-regressive in nature. BERT is not. That is a trade off. In losing auto-regression, BERT gained the ability to incorporate the context on both sides of a word to gain better results. XLNet brings back autoregression while finding an alternative way to incorporate the context on both sides.</p>

<h3 id="the-evolution-of-the-transformer-block">The Evolution of the Transformer Block</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">initial transformer paper</a> introduced two types of transformer blocks:</p>

<h4 id="the-encoder-block">The Encoder Block</h4>

<p>First is the encoder block:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-encoder-block-2.png">
  <br>
  An encoder block from the original transformer paper can take inputs up until a certain max sequence length (e.g. 512 tokens). It's okay if an input sequence is shorter than this limit, we can just pad the rest of the sequence.
</p>

<h4 id="the-decoder-block">The Decoder Block</h4>
<p>Second, there’s the decoder block which has a small architectural variation from the encoder block – a layer to allow it to pay attention to specific segments from the encoder:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-decoder-block-2.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>One key difference in the self-attention layer here, is that it masks future tokens – not by changing the word to [mask] like BERT, but by interfering in the self-attention calculation blocking information from tokens that are to the right of the position being calculated.</p>

<p>If, for example, we’re to highlight the path of position #4, we can see that it is only allowed to attend to the present and previous tokens:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-decoder-block-self-attention-2.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>It’s important that the distinction between self-attention (what BERT uses) and masked self-attention (what GPT-2 uses) is clear. A normal self-attention block allows a position to peak at tokens to its right. Masked self-attention prevents that from happening:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/self-attention-and-masked-self-attention.png">
  <br>
</p>

<h4 id="the-decoder-only-block">The Decoder-Only Block</h4>
<p>Subsequent to the original paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf">Generating Wikipedia by Summarizing Long Sequences</a> proposed another arrangement of the transformer block that is capable of doing language modeling. This model threw away the Transformer encoder. For that reason, let’s call the model the “Transformer-Decoder”. This early transformer-based language model was made up of a stack of six transformer decoder blocks:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/xlnet/transformer-decoder-intro.png">
  <br>
  The decoder blocks are identical. I have expanded the first one so you can see its self-attention layer is the masked variant. Notice that the model now can address up to 4,000 tokens in a certain segment -- a massive upgrade from the 512 in the original transformer.
</p>

<p>These blocks were very similar to the original decoder blocks, except they did away with that second self-attention layer. A similar architecture was examined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04444.pdf">Character-Level Language Modeling with Deeper Self-Attention</a> to create a language model that predicts one letter/character at a time.</p>

<p>The OpenAI GPT-2 model uses these decoder-only blocks.</p>

<h3 id="crash-course-in-brain-surgery-looking-inside-gpt-2">Crash Course in Brain Surgery: Looking Inside GPT-2</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.
~<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgie_(band)">Budgie</a></strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let’s lay a trained GPT-2 on our surgery table and look at how it works.</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt-2-layers-2.png">
  <br>
  The GPT-2 can process 1024 tokens. Each token flows through all the decoder blocks along its own path.
</p>

<p>The simplest way to run a trained GPT-2 is to allow it to ramble on its own (which is technically called <em>generating unconditional samples</em>) – alternatively, we can give it a prompt to have it speak about a certain topic (a.k.a generating <em>interactive conditional samples</em>). In the rambling case, we can simply hand it the start token and have it start generating words (the trained model uses <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> as its start token. Let’s call it <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> instead).</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-simple-output-2.gif"></p>
</div>

<p>The model only has one input token, so that path would be the only active one. The token is processed successively through all the layers, then a vector is produced along that path. That vector can be scored against the model’s vocabulary (all the words the model knows, 50,000 words in the case of GPT-2). In this case we selected the token with the highest probability, ‘the’. But we can certainly mix things up – you know how if you keep clicking the suggested word in your keyboard app, it sometimes can stuck in repetitive loops where the only way out is if you click the second or third suggested word. The same can happen here. GPT-2 has a parameter called top-k that we can use to have the model consider sampling words other than the top word (which is the case when top-k = 1).</p>

<p>In the next step, we add the output from the first step to our input sequence, and have the model make its next prediction:</p>

<p><img src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt-2-simple-output-3.gif">
  <br>
</p>

<p>Notice that the second path is the only that’s active in this calculation. Each layer of GPT-2 has retained its own interpretation of the first token and will use it in processing the second token (we’ll get into more detail about this in the following section about self-attention). GPT-2 does not re-interpret the first token in light of the second token.</p>

<h3 id="a-deeper-look-inside">A Deeper Look Inside</h3>

<h4 id="input-encoding">Input Encoding</h4>
<p>Let’s look at more details to get to know the model more intimately. Let’s start from the input. As in other NLP models we’ve discussed before, the model looks up the …</p></div></div>

                    <div>
                 <p>102 years ago on 11 November 1918 the Armistice with Germany was signed ending the Great War. All was quiet on the Western front. The guns of August had led to the mechanized slaughter of millions. The armistice did not end the conflict; it only delayed the resolution another 30 years or so. </p>
<p>On this day we remember all veterans of wars who go out and do the dirty work for the rest of us. It's the old men who always start wars. It's the rich, lazy and indolent who refuse to fight them. It's the veterans who respond to the call.</p>
<p>We remember you. Thank you.</p>

                <p>Close your eyes and think about these situations:</p><p>Situation one: Imagine you are on your way to work on a Monday morning. You take the regular metro (or subway or bus), which is extremely crowded. Five minutes after you get in, you notice that an older woman loses her balance and falls. She gets hurt and is crying in pain. By the looks, it might be a severe injury.</p><p>What would you do?</p><p>Before you read on, please take a second to visualize what you would do for the older woman.</p><p>Situation two- It is the same as above. The only difference is that the injured person is not an older stranger, but one of your parents.</p><p>What would you do now? Would it be any different from the first situation?</p><p>I believe that a lot of people would help the older woman from the first situation to a certain extent. Maybe they take her to the closest hospital, or they call the emergency services, or they call someone from her phone. And the situation would end there.</p><p>In the second case, most would probably take their parent to the hospital, take the day off from work, and stay with their parent until they get the necessary treatment and recover fully.</p><p>As expected, the level of <em>ownership</em> is much higher in the second case compared to the first.</p><p>In the first instance, the person worked towards a short term goal or an instant output - get the injured person immediate help. In the second case, the person fought for a longer-term goal and an <em>outcome - </em>help the parent get <em>whatever</em> they need to recover.</p><p>The above set of actions sound apparent, because in one situation, the wounded is a stranger, and in the second, they are a parent. But that is not the point. The point is that the same person can operate at different levels of ownership depending on how much they care about the outcome.</p><p>Great product managers genuinely care about the problems they solve and the solutions they deliver. Great product managers also have an exceptionally high level of ownership.</p><p>Let us understand the advantages of being a high ownership PM:</p><ol><li><strong>Confidence and trust. </strong>Direct manager, peers, and seniors will have very high confidence in those who consistently own and deliver results. They will be the most coveted team member or leader for critical and complex tasks.</li><li><strong>Better decision making. </strong>High ownership individuals have the "do whatever it takes" attitude. Getting things done requires excellent decision making. PMs who are ownership driven create systems and processes to enable and improve their decisions.</li><li><strong>Bigger and stronger network.</strong> Most business-critical decisions require alignment across multiple leaders and teams. High ownership PMs build and leverage relationships to expedite the process of making difficult decisions.</li><li><strong>Create a positive and happy culture in the organization. </strong>Great PMs are self-motivated and deliver positive results, which builds a success-driven culture - something that every employer desires.</li><li><strong>Create a meaningful and visible impact. </strong>As long as PMs are working on the right tasks - which great PMs always do - their work will create a positive impact on their team and the organization.</li></ol><p>At this stage, you might be asking yourself - "How do I become (more) ownership driven?" And, we have the answer to that question, which I will share in the next post.</p><p>For now, I leave you with one of Gary W. Keller's quote, that summarizes the importance of <em>ownership</em>.</p><blockquote>Taking complete ownership of your outcomes by holding no one but yourself responsible for them is the most powerful thing you can do to drive your success.</blockquote>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
	<p>Silentium has introduced advanced, broad-band active road noise cancellation to the auto industry for the first time.</p>
<p>After several years in development, Jaguar and Land Rover are the first carmakers to integrate Silentium’s ‘Active Acoustics’ software in three of their new vehicles, meaning the technology is now available for car buyers to experience. Active road noise cancellation removes 90% of unwanted noise across a broad band of frequencies – from 20Hz up to 1kHz – providing a quieter and more refined experience for occupants, and therefore preventing driver fatigue.</p>
<p>In addition to wellbeing benefits, Silentium’s Active Acoustics technology offers vehicle manufacturers a way to reduce their reliance on costly passive noise damping and insulation materials, and reduce vehicle weight – an increasingly important R&amp;D factor as the industry enters a new era of electro-mobility.</p>
<p>Anthony Manias, Head of Automotive at Silentium, commented: “<em>Active Acoustics will change the way car manufacturers reduce, cancel and enhance sound inside their vehicles, and how customers perceive and interact with these sounds. Silentium has proven that it can make broadband in-car noise cancellation work – now the duty is on carmakers to adopt the technology and ensure their customers can enjoy the benefits.”</em></p>
<p><img src="https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="756" srcset="https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1.jpg 1000w, https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1-768x581.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><strong>How active noise cancellation works</strong></p>
<p>Silentium’s industry-first technology is similar to that found in a pair of high-end noise-cancelling headphones, but more advanced as it manipulates a larger amount of air. Up to six strategically positioned accelerometers on a vehicle’s chassis monitor unwanted road noise and send a signal to an on-board control unit with Silentium’s software, which plays an equivalent anti-noise signal through the vehicle’s speaker system. The pressure waves from both the unwanted exterior noise and manufactured anti-noise reach occupants’ eardrums at exactly the same time and cancel each other out.</p>
<p>Silentium’s Active Acoustics software can reduce, cancel and enhance sound inside any vehicle, improving occupant comfort, safety and wellbeing, and creating a more enjoyable environment for all.</p>

reasons: analyzing the competition, aggregating news feeds to follow trends in particular markets, or collecting daily
stock prices to build predictive models…</p>
<p>Whether you’re a data scientist or a business analyst, you may be in this situation from time to time and ask yourself
this ever-lasting question: <strong>How can I possibly extract this website’s data to conduct market analysis?</strong></p>
<p>One possible free way to extract website data and structure it is scraping. In this post, you’ll learn about data
scraping and how to easily build your first scraper in python.</p>

<p>Let me spare you long definitions.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, data scraping is the process of extracting a website’s data programmatically and structuring it
according to one’s needs. Many companies are using data scraping to gather external data and support their business
operations: this is currently a common practice in multiple fields.</p>
<h4 id="What-do-I-need-to-know-to-learn-data-scraping-in-python"><a href="#What-do-I-need-to-know-to-learn-data-scraping-in-python" aria-label="What do I need to know to learn data scraping in python permalink"></a>What do I need to know to learn data scraping in python?</h4>
<p>Not much. To build small scrapers, you’ll have to be a little bit familiar with Python and HTML syntaxes.</p>
<p>To build scalable and industrial scrapers, you’ll need to know one or two frameworks such as
<a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> or <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2---Build-your-first-scraper-in-Python"><a href="#2---Build-your-first-scraper-in-Python" aria-label="2   Build your first scraper in Python permalink"></a>2 - Build your first scraper in Python</h3>
<h4 id="Setup-your-environment"><a href="#Setup-your-environment" aria-label="Setup your environment permalink"></a>Setup your environment</h4>
<p>Let’s learn how to turn a website into structured data! To do this, you’ll first need to install the following
libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">requests</a></strong>: to simulate HTTP requests like GET and POST. We’ll mainly
use it to access the source page of any given website.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a></strong>: to parse HTML and XML data very easily</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://lxml.de/">lxml</a></strong>: to increase the parsing speed of XML files</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a></strong>: to structure the data in dataframes and export it in the format of your
choice (JSON, Excel, CSV, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>, you should be good to go: all these packages are already
installed. Otherwise, you should run the following commands:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> requests
pip <span>install</span> beautifulsoup4
pip <span>install</span> lxml
pip <span>install</span> pandas</code></pre></div>
<p>To make people easily follow along with my video tutorial, I also used a jupyter notebook to make the process
interactive.</p>

<p>One friend of mine asked me if I could help him scrape this
<a href="https://www.premiumbeautynews.com/fr/marches-tendances/">website</a>. So I decided to do it in a tutorial.</p>
<p>This website is called <strong>Premium Beauty News</strong>. It publishes recent trends in the beauty market. If you look at the
front page, you’ll see that the articles that we want to scrape are organized in a grid.</p>

<p>Of course, we won’t extract the header of each article appearing on these pages only. We’ll go inside each post and grab
everything we need:</p>
<p>the <strong>title</strong>, the <strong>date</strong>, the <strong>abstract</strong>:</p>
<figure>
    <span>

<p>And of course the remaining <strong>full content</strong> of the post.</p>
<h3 id="Show-me-the-code"><a href="#Show-me-the-code" aria-label="Show me the code permalink"></a>Show me the code!</h3>
<p>Because that’s why you’re here, right?</p>
<p>Basic imports first:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> requests
<span>from</span> bs4 <span>import</span> BeautifulSoup
<span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd
<span>from</span> tqdm <span>import</span> tqdm_notebook</code></pre></div>
<p>I usually define a function to parse the content of each page given its URL. This function will be called multiple
times. Let’s call it <strong>parse_url</strong>:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>parse_url</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    response <span>=</span> requests<span>.</span>get<span>(</span>url<span>)</span>
    content <span>=</span> response<span>.</span>content
    parsed_response <span>=</span> BeautifulSoup<span>(</span>content<span>,</span> <span>"lxml"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> parsed_response</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="Extracting-each-post-data-and-metadata"><a href="#Extracting-each-post-data-and-metadata" aria-label="Extracting each post data and metadata permalink"></a>Extracting each post data and metadata</h4>
<p>I will first start by defining a function that extracts the data of each post (the title, date, abstract, etc) given its
URL. Then we’ll later call this function inside a for loop that goes over all the pages.</p>
<p>To build our scraper, we first have to understand the underlying HTML logic and structure of the page. Let’s start by
extracting the title of the post.</p>
<p>By inspecting this element on Chrome inspector:</p>
<figure>
    <span>
      <a href="https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/static/4fbd9fabd279423673553a46b7b6776d/a8200/title.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span>
    <figcaption>title of the post</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>we notice that the title appears inside an <strong>h1</strong> of the class <strong>“article-title”</strong>. After extracting the content of the
page using BeautifulSoup, extracting the title can be done using the <strong>find method</strong>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>title <span>=</span> soup_post<span>.</span>find<span>(</span><span>"h1"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"class"</span><span>:</span> <span>"article-title"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>text</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s now look at the date:</p>
<figure>
    <span>
      <a href="https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/static/e0c41610dab1b93cf1c5893af9e5393a/a8200/date.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="date of the post" title="date of the post" src="https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/static/e0c41610dab1b93cf1c5893af9e5393a/b9e4f/date.png" srcset="https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/static/e0c41610dab1b93cf1c5893af9e5393a/cf440/date.png 148w,
https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/static/e0c41610dab1b93cf1c5893af9e5393a/d2d38/date.png 295w,
https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/static/e0c41610dab1b93cf1c5893af9e5393a/b9e4f/date.png 590w,

  </a>
    </span>
    <figcaption>date of the post</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The date appears inside a <strong>span</strong>, which itself appears inside a <strong>header</strong> of the class <strong>“row sub-header”</strong>.
Translating this into code is quite easy using BeautifulSoup:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>datetime <span>=</span> soup_post<span>.</span>find<span>(</span><span>"header"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"class"</span><span>:</span> <span>"row sub-  header"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>find<span>(</span><span>"span"</span><span>)</span><span>[</span><span>"datetime"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Regarding the abstract:</p>

<p>it looks like it’s contained in an <strong>h2</strong> tag of the class “article-intro”.</p>

<p>Now, what about the full content of the post? It’s actually pretty easy to extract. This content is spread over multiple
paragraphs <strong>(p tags)</strong> inside a <strong>div</strong> of the class <strong>“article-text”.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of going through each individual <strong>p tag</strong>, extracting its text, and then concatenating all the texts,
BeautifulSoup can extract the full text in one way like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>content <span>=</span> soup_post<span>.</span>find<span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"class"</span><span>:</span> <span>"article-text"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>text</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s package everything in a single function:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>extract_post_data</span><span>(</span>post_url<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    soup_post <span>=</span> parse_url<span>(</span>post_url<span>)</span>

<p>If we inspect the source of the home page, where articles are shown with their headlines,</p>

<p>we’ll see that each of the ten posts appearing in the grid is inside a div of class <strong>“post-style1 col-md-6”</strong> which is
itself inside a <strong>section</strong> of class <strong>“content”</strong>.</p>
<p>Extracting posts per page is therefore quite easy:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>url <span>=</span> <span>"https://www.premiumbeautynews.com/fr/marches-tendances/"</span>
soup <span>=</span> parse_url<span>(</span>url<span>)</span>
section <span>=</span> soup<span>.</span>find<span>(</span><span>"section"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"class"</span><span>:</span> <span>"content"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
posts <span>=</span> section<span>.</span>findAll<span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"class"</span><span>:</span> <span>"post-style1 col-md-6"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, for each individual post, we can extract the URL which appears inside an <strong>“a tag”</strong> that is itself inside an
<strong>h4</strong>. We’ll use this URL to call our previously defined function <strong>extract<em>post</em>data</strong>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>uri <span>=</span> post<span>.</span>find<span>(</span><span>"h4"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>find<span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>)</span><span>[</span><span>"href"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="Paginating"><a href="#Paginating" aria-label="Paginating permalink"></a>Paginating</h4>
<p>Once the posts are extracted on a given page, you may want to go to the next page and repeat the same operation.</p>
<p>If you look at the pagination, you’ll notice a “next button”:</p>

    </span>
    <figcaption>pagination</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>This button becomes inactive once you reach the last page. Put differently, while the next button is active, you have to
tell the scraper to grab the posts of the current page, move to the next page and repeat the operation. When the button
becomes inactive, the process should stop.</p>
<p>Wrapping up this logic, this translates into the following code:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>next_button <span>=</span> <span>""</span>
posts_data <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
count <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

        count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once this loop completes, you’ll have all the data inside posts_data, which you can turn it into a beautiful dataframe
and export to CSV or Excel file.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>df <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>DataFrame<span>(</span>posts_data<span>)</span>

<p>You just learned how to build your first scraper, congratulations!</p>
<p>Now if you want to improve it you may think about these next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiprocessing and multithreading the execution of the script</li>
<li>Scheduling the run of the scraper over periods of time, to automate data scraping</li>
<li>Handle error — scrapers are hard to maintain over time because the source code may change</li>
<li>Deploy a database or an s3 bucket to store the scraped items</li>
</ul>
<p>This may get you busy for a while! Happy data scraping!</p></article></section><section></section></section></section></div></div>]]>

November 8, 2020 | https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2020-09-28-alfred-github-repos/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2020-09-28-alfred-github-repos/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One thing I do multiple times a day is browsing my company’s GitHub organization repositories.<br>
My process for opening these repositories in the browser is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Chrome</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to focus the address bar</li>
<li>Start typing the GitHub repository name</li>
<li>Look for the page suggestion and click on it</li>
</ul>
<p>This flow works well for repositories that I have starred as bookmarks or that I browsed recently…<br>
…But because I’m a total sucker for Alfred, today I wasted almost an hour moving this process into an Alfred workflow.</p>

<h2>The Action Plan</h2>
<p>Knowing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire repository list is huge and doesn’t change often</li>
<li>I wanted the Alfred repository search result to be instant</li>
</ul>
<p>Making an API request to filter the repositories each time I invoke the Alfred workflow wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>So I decided to 1) download the entire repository list into a JSON file, 2) transform it into an Alred-compatible format, and 3) use the <a href="https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alfred’s fuzzy search helper</a> to filter the results.</p>
<h2>Creating the GitHub repository list</h2>
<p>First of all, I <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">created a GitHub API token with a scope to access the repositories list</a>.</p>
<p><span>

<blockquote>
<p>TIL: Selecting all the “repo” sub-scopes is not the same as selecting the entire scope — which is needed to use the API token to get the list of all the private repositories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GitHub API pagination has a limit of 200 items per page. I needed to fetch way more than 200 repositories, so I modified <a href="https://gist.github.com/mbohun/b161521b2440b9f08b59" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this cool (but outdated) bash script</a> to fetch all of them in a single command and print them out to the console:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>${<span>#</span>@}</span> -lt <span>2</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"usage: <span>$0</span> [your github credentials as 'user:token'] [REST expression]"</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> -z <span>"<span>$last_page</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    
    rest_call <span>"https://api.github.com<span>${GITHUB_API_REST}</span>?per_page=200"</span>

    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>

<span>cat</span> <span>$TMPFILE</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I named the script <code>githubapi-get.sh</code> and used it this way:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
githubapi-get.sh <span>"{USERNAME}:{TOKEN}"</span> <span>"/orgs/{ORGANIZATION}/repos"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-company-repos.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>FYI, you can also run it this way to get all the repositories you have access to (both on your personal account and on other organization accounts):</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
githubapi-get.sh <span>"{USERNAME}:{TOKEN}"</span> <span>"/user/repos"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-github-repos.txt</code></pre></div>
<h2>Making the repository list compatible with Alfred</h2>
<p>To populate the Alfred list filter, for each repo I extracted the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: Unique identifier for the item which allows Alfred to learn about this item for subsequent sorting and ordering of the user’s actioned results. I used the repository ID (<code>id</code>).</li>
<li><code>arg</code>: The argument which is passed through the workflow to open it in the browser. I used the repository URL (<code>html_url</code>).</li>
<li><code>title</code>: The title displayed in the result row. I used the repository name (<code>name</code>).</li>
<li><code>subtitle</code>: The subtitle displayed in the result row. I used the repository description (<code>description</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the following <code>jq</code> script:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>cat</span> ~/my-company-repos.txt <span>|</span> jq -s <span>'.[] | map({ arg: .html_url, uid: .id, title: .name, subtitle: .description }) | { items: . }'</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-company-repos.json</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>jq</code> script generates a <code>~/my-company-repos.json</code> file compatible with the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/json/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alfred Script Filter JSON format</a>.</p>
<h2>Creating the Alfred workflow</h2>
<p>The Alfred standard script filtering doesn’t have a good fuzzy search option — which I really wanted given the huge amount of repositories.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I used <a href="https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">alfred-fuzzy</a>, a Python helper script for Alfred that replaces the “Alfred filters results” option with fuzzy search.</p>
<p>Here’s what I did, step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new empty Alfred workflow</li>
<li>Right-click on the created workflow ⭢ “Open in Finder”</li>
<li>In the workflow directory, copy and paste both <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy/master/fuzzy.py" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fuzzy.py</a> and <code>my-company-repos.json</code>.</li>
<li>In the workflow, create the following “Script Filter”:

<li>In the workflow, connect the “Script Filter” to the “Open URL” action:

      <span></span>
  <img alt="workflow 2" title="workflow 2" src="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/ca9a91ea4b4aed993050fc92f0780f4d/fcda8/workflow-2.png" srcset="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/ca9a91ea4b4aed993050fc92f0780f4d/12f09/workflow-2.png 148w,

    </span></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it.
I can now invoke the workflow using the keyword set in the “Script Filter” action and fuzzy search the repo I’m interested in.</p>
<p>Alfred is also smart enough to keep track of my workflow usage, surfacing the most clicked results to the top of the list 💥</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the workflow can be improved in several ways (e.g.: auto-update the repository list after n days)… but I’m happy enough with the current result for now.</p>

And the way that I got started on was writing my first book, about 10 years ago, almost exactly, I got a book deal to write my first book. I was not a writer, I hated writing as a kid did not think of myself as a writer. But I’d written some blog posts, and got a book deal.</p><p>0:45<br>And I</p><p>0:47<br>quickly realized that nothing that I had learned about productivity, had prepared me to write a book, I had been a productivity enthusiast, I love to getting things done, and was always trying different tools. But when it came time to write a book, I realized it was just banging my head against the wall for 12 hours a day. And just to get like, 15 minutes of writing that that came easily. And, you know, I tried to clear away my whole schedule, I fired clients, I kind of a lot of my social life, I outsource things, you know, my meal preparation, household chores, cleaning the house, all this stuff. I just cleared out my whole schedule. And I just still couldn’t really get the book, yet it progress going on the book. And I even had a friend say, you just look at the data on your contract and break it down. It was like 250 words a day. Okay, cool. I put that on the calendar and everything. No, it doesn’t work that way. You can’t just like, sit down and write 250 words a day, you have to have the thoughts behind those 250 words, first, you have to like get that all organized. And I did suffer through writing that book. But when the smoke cleared on that process, I wanted to figure out how I had managed to accomplish this, I had started to develop patterns and routines to make that sort of moment of flow happen to make those insights happen. And I started to dig into the neuroscience and the psychology of creativity. And I started to see patterns there. And so I wrote a blog post in 2012, called mind management, not time management. And that prompted Dan Ariely, the behavioral scientist to reach out to me and he was working on an app called timeful. And we collaborated on that app, I was the design advisor to the team, helping them integrate sort of a mind management philosophy into that app. And then an app sold to Google. And I all along been experimenting. I’ve even redesigned my entire life around my creative output. I moved to Columbia five years ago, where I now live. And so during all that time, I’ve really been trying to tweak this system to have a consistent way to manage creative energy toward having those moments where you have the ideas come easily to you. And so I think I’ve I think I’ve got it. So the book just came out. And I have like a far more healthy approach to creativity now, thanks to the things that I’ve learned.</p><p>3:52<br>Or how do you think the being creative engine has helped you? And what about creativity is so important in today’s world?</p><p>4:06<br>Well, I mean, as far as right helping me, I think that I had sort of settled into unhealthy patterns of getting creative work done, I wanted to create my own thing. But I it just became, it just became very unsustainable, which is working around the clock, damaging relationships, of just being obsessed with trying to create things and trying to deal with the day to day world along the way. And so being able to have the confidence that I have a system to manage the energy to manage my project, so they go forward consistently, is just great for my mental health in general, because Take, for example, something like writing that book, it was just, it was just this huge single to do item that was never done. And I didn’t know or have a confidence that I would arrive at the point where I would get it done. But now I have a better perspective of how the creative process works, how my energy works, along with that creative process, how the cycles in the world are there that you can harness to propel your creative projects forward. And so it’s just day to day a lot more relaxing, to be me than it was before. And I think that my work improves as a result of it. Now, as far as why creativity is so important, this wasn’t the reason that I became a creator. But, you know, in this age of AI, where if you can teach a human how to do something, or you can automate it, or you can outsource it, and it will soon be automated, you know, Kai Fuli, who I was, who was a AI expert, work for Google projected 40 to 50% of jobs being replaced by AI in the next 10 to 20 years or so. And a lot of people think it is kind of scary, in a lot of people think that is scary. And you know, there’s a whole other conversation about whether that should happen. But it’s happening there, it appears to be happening. And it’s actually very freeing for us as humans because it means that well now we can go back to being creative. And in fact, if you want to have an edge as a human, you need to be creative. So you can sit down and you can type in 50,000 nonsense words in a day or so. And but you your computer could generate 50,000 nonsense words in you know, instantly fashion you could blink. So you know what the where the value is in is in writing that novel or 50 the thoughts behind the words not in the words themselves?</p><p>7:23<br>Have you seen the stuff on GPT three, and they they’ve produced content that has apparently like full people? Well, some of the some of the content produced by GPT three ranks like on the top page on the first page of Hacker News.</p><p>7:40<br>Yeah, I haven’t seen that level of GPG three I have seen some experiments from sage and l Shane who is messing around with, with ay ay ay. Ay ay ay ay weirdness, calm and, and it was, you know, it was not that impressive, actually, like, how many how many eyes does a horse have? And it just like kept saying for? Like, I don’t know, I think that who knows, I guess I could be wrong like the way that some people were writing and cranking out formulaic say, mystery novels or something I could see AI doing that at some point, but I think there’s always going to be a place for becoming you because there’s only one you and and, and finding a way to present that to the world. So I could be wrong. But I defer to Kai Fuli on this, he doesn’t seem to think that that’s gonna be happening</p><p>8:40<br>terribly soon, if ever.</p><p>8:45<br>So I think that, I guess that</p><p>8:50<br>in terms of the the last thing to be automated by AI would be harnessing that creativity. A lot of the followers on, on this, on this channel are into, into writing and note taking, how do you think that? What What’s something that? How do you think they can benefit from changing, changing their perspective on focusing only on, you know, being busy and focusing on like managing the time and getting as much as possible out of time, as opposed to focusing on mind management and on creative energy management?</p><p>9:37<br>Yeah, so one of the things I’m a note taker, as well, I’ve sort of built my own little zettelkasten. And I think one of the things that makes it work is a lot of the similar to what I’ve found in writing this book, which is that you don’t arrive at great insights or you don’t arrive at learning All at once, you know, taking notes makes, it just reduces the cognitive load for thinking about, say, what is this book about you just like write one little note, another note, another note, another note. And then eventually, you can connect those things. And, you know, make a summary or you can check for new project ideas from different places and make new ideas. But this is kind of like one of the things that I’ve discovered. In dissecting creativity, there is this sort of framework for understanding the stages of creativity, I’m calling it in the book, the four stages of creativity is based upon a speech by a German scientists from the late 1800s, which was then picked up by a guy named Herman Bell, von Helmholtz. And then there was a social scientist named Graham Wallace, who called the four stages of control, and which I just adapted to the four stages of creativity, and their prep your preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. So preparation is the collecting of information. incubation is the sort of pulling away from the problem space. And there’s all sorts of subconscious incubation, that happens, that makes things easier to later Connect for new ideas. illumination is that moment of having an insight. And then verification is preparing something to verify that it’s ready to be shipped or that it actually is a valid idea. And so this is something that happens when you’re you’re taking notes, as you’re doing the preparation, you’re just collecting these short, little notes. And that is, as you’re doing that you’re exercising those connections in your mind. And so as you sleep, or as you do other things, your brain is sort of testing out connections, it’s any sort of bad dead end connections that you came up with along the way. Are, those are falling away, it’s a it’s called fixation forgetting. And then later on, when you do sit down to say, write the summary of the book that you just took a bunch of notes on it, suddenly, it’s way, way easier. Because that stuff has sunk into your mind. We very easily forget, when we sit down and say, Oh, I’m gonna try to write a summary of this book, or I’m gonna try to write an article or a blog post. And …</p></div></div></div></div>

November 8, 2020 | http://blog.danieljanus.pl/2020/11/08/coronalotto/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.danieljanus.pl/2020/11/08/coronalotto/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Before</h2><p>It seems so obvious in hindsight. Here in Poland, people have been guessing it ever since the pandemic breakout: in private conversations, in random threads on social media, in comments under governmental information outlets. It seemed a&nbsp;matter of time before someone came up with something like this. In fact, on one Sunday evening in October, I&nbsp;found myself flabbergasted that apparently no one yet has.</p><p>I&nbsp;doled out $4 for a&nbsp;domain, <a href="http://koronalotek.pl/">koronalotek.pl</a> (can be translated as “coronalotto” or “coronalottery” – occurrences of the name on Twitter date back at least as far as April), and fired up a&nbsp;REPL. A&nbsp;few hours and 250 Clojure LOCs later, the site was up.</p><p>I&nbsp;wanted it to&nbsp;be as simple as possible. A&nbsp;form with two fields: “your name” and “how many cases tomorrow?” A&nbsp;top-ten list of today’s winners, sorted by the absolute difference between the guess and the actual number of cases, as <a href="https://twitter.com/mz_gov_pl">reported daily on Twitter</a> by the Polish Ministry of Health. The official number, prominently displayed. And that’s all.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek.png"></p><p>On 17 October, I&nbsp;posted the link on my Facebook and Twitter feeds, and waited. The stream of guesses started to&nbsp;trickle in.</p><h2>After</h2><p>It never grew to&nbsp;be more than a&nbsp;stream, but it hasn’t gone completely unnoticed either.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-g1.png"></p><p>The above plot shows daily number of accepted guesses (i.e., those that were used to&nbsp;generate the next day’s winners) over time – a&nbsp;metric of popularity. Each day’s number means guesses cast in the 24 hours up until 10:30 (Warsaw time) on that day, which is when the official numbers are published by the Ministry of Health.</p><p>I’ve been filtering out automated submissions, as well as excess manual submissions by the same IP that seemed to&nbsp;skew the results too much – I’ve arbitrarily set the “excess” threshold at 10. The missing datapoint for 19 October is not a&nbsp;zero, but a&nbsp;N/A: I’ve lost that datapoint due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;glitch. More on this below.</p><p>The interest peaked on October 23, with more than a&nbsp;thousand guesses for that day (I&nbsp;think it was reposted by someone with a&nbsp;significant outreach back then), and has been slowly declining since.</p><p>I&nbsp;have privately received some feedback. One person has pointed out that they found the site distasteful and that making fun of pandemic tragedies made them uncomfortable. (I&nbsp;empathise; for me it’s not so much making fun as it is a&nbsp;coping mechanism—a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;put distance between my thoughts and the difficult times we’re in and to&nbsp;keep fears at bay.) Some people, however, have thanked me for making them smile when they guessed more or less correctly.</p><p>Back to&nbsp;data. Being a&nbsp;data junkie, I&nbsp;looked at what I&nbsp;had been collecting. First things first: how accurate is the collective predictive power of the guessers?</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-g2.png"></p><p>Quite accurate, in fact! Data for this plot has only been slightly preprocessed, by filtering out “unreasonable” guesses that don’t fall within the range <code>[100; 50000]</code>.</p><p>People have over- and underguesstimated the number of new cases, but not by much. There were only a&nbsp;few occasions where the actual case count didn’t fall within one standard deviation of the mean of guesses (represented by the whiskers around blue bars on the plot). Granted, the daily standard deviation tends to&nbsp;be large (on the order of a&nbsp;few thousand), but still, I’m impressed. A&nbsp;paper on estimating the growth of pandemic based on coronalottery results coming soon to&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal near you! ;-)</p><p>Just for the heck of it, I’ve also been looking at individual votes. Specifically, names. Here’s a&nbsp;snapshot of unique guessers’ names sorted by decreasing length, on 23 October. (NSFW warning: expletives ahead!)</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-names.jpg"></p><p>Let me translate a&nbsp;few of these for those of you who don’t speak Polish:</p><p>1 is “Sasin has fucked over 70 million zlotys for elections that didn’t take place and was never held responsible.” This alludes to&nbsp;the <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/05/27/70-million-zloty-bill-for-polands-abandoned-presidential-election/">ghost election in Poland</a> from May. This news had gone memetic, going so far as Minister Sasin’s name being ironically used as a&nbsp;dimensionless unit of 70 million (think Avogadro’s number). You’ll discover the same theme in #2, #3, #5, and others.</p><p>6 is “CT {Constitutional Tribunal}, you focking botch, stop repressing my abortion”. Just a&nbsp;day before, the Polish constitutional court (whose current legality is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Tribunal_(Poland)#2015%E2%80%93present:_Polish_Constitutional_Court_crisis">disputed at best</a>) has <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/10/22/constitutional-court-ruling-ends-almost-all-legal-abortion-in-poland/">decreed a&nbsp;ban on almost all legal abortion</a> in Poland, giving rise to&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/31/europe/poland-abortion-protests-scli-intl/index.html">the biggest street protests in decades</a>.</p><p>Not all is political: 4 is “Why study for the exam if we’re not gonna survive until November anyway?”. I&nbsp;hope whoever wrote this is alive and well.</p><p>Corollary? Give people a&nbsp;text field, and they’ll use it to&nbsp;express themselves: politically or otherwise.</p><p>In fact, I&nbsp;have taken the liberty of chiming in. Shortly after, I&nbsp;altered the thank-you page (which used to&nbsp;just say “thanks for guessing”) to&nbsp;proudly display one of the emblems of the Women’s Strike, along with a&nbsp;link to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://zrzutka.pl/kasa-na-aborcyjny-dream-team-55g5gx">crowdfounding campaign</a> for an NGO that supports women needing abortion.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-thanks.jpg"></p><h2>Inside out</h2><p>I’m not much of a&nbsp;DevOps person, so I&nbsp;deployed it the quick and dirty way, not caring about scalability or performance. The maxim “make it as simple as possible” permeates the setup.</p><p>I&nbsp;just started a&nbsp;REPL within a&nbsp;<code>screen</code> session on the tiny Scaleway C1 server that also hosts this blog and some of my other personal stuff. I&nbsp;launched a&nbsp;Jetty server within it, and set up a&nbsp;nginx proxy. And that’s pretty much it. I&nbsp;liberally tinker with the app’s state in “production,” evaluating all kinds of expressions when I&nbsp;feel like it.</p><p>Code changes are deployed by <code>git pull</code>ing new developments and doing <code>(require 'koronalotek.core :reload)</code> in the REPL.</p><p>Someone tried a&nbsp;SQL injection attack. This is doomed to&nbsp;fail because there’s no SQL involved. In fact, there’s no database at all. The entire state is kept in an in-memory atom and periodically synced out to&nbsp;an EDN file.

November 8, 2020 | https://blog.min.io/the-long-term-costs-of-storage-in-the-cloud/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.min.io/the-long-term-costs-of-storage-in-the-cloud/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The promise/allure of the public cloud is based on the concept that it is elastic. One can, with little effort, scale up workloads and, if desired, scale down those same workloads. We have <a href="https://blog.min.io/repatriation_wave/">written on this subject before</a> - from the perspective of what workloads to consider as you evaluate what to take to the public cloud and what to repatriate to the private cloud. <br></p><p>We have not, however, taken a hard look at the costs associated with the two options. Our position can be related as an analogy. The public cloud is like a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities, secure, spacious etc. It is priced like a nice hotel too. As a result, people don’t live in nice hotels - they stay there for a period of time to achieve a certain objective (business trip, vacation) because it gets too expensive otherwise. <br></p><div><p>We wanted to quantify this objectively so we rolled up our sleeves, made some reasonable assumptions and wrote this post. Here we go:</p><p>If we assume that we will be using object storage in the cloud and want to understand the costs of deploying a PB of data (200TB active, 800TB inactive, with a Read:Write ratio of 80:20) we can compute what this storage would cost on various public clouds.</p></div><p>AWS S3 storage tiers costs are as follows (See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/</a>). This should not be a surprise as prices have not changed in the last four years (but costs have :).<br></p><ul><li><strong>S3 Standard</strong> storage the first 50TB costs $0.023 per month per GB, the next 450TB costs $0.22 per month per GB, and all storage over 500TB costs $0.021 per month per GB. So 1PB of S3 Standard storage would cost $1.2K/month for the 1st 50TB, $9.9K/month for the next 450 TB and $10.3K/month for the next 500TB or <strong>$21.6K/month for 1PB of data</strong>.</li><li><strong>S3 Intelligent Tiering </strong>storage costs the same as S3 Standard for frequently active data and $0.0125 for infrequently accessed data plus an $0.0025 per 1000 Objects fee for management. So assuming 200TB:800TB active:inactive the active data would cost $1.2K/month for 50TB and $3.3K/month for the 150TB and $10.0K for the inactive 800TB. To that, we must add object management costs. It’s not unusual to see PB data warehouse with billions of objects/files. So if we assume 1B objects (average ~1MB/object) in our PB of data object management costs would be $2.5K per month. Totaling all that together we have an overall <strong>storage and object management costs of</strong> ~<strong>$17.0K per month for our 1PB of data</strong>. <br></li></ul><p>It is true one could do a blend of standard S3 plus S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive, but that doesn’t really get to the apples to apples comparison we are seeking. So for the purposes of this we will consider the first two. <br></p><p>Although Azure and GCP don’t have exactly equivalent tiers of storage, if we just focus on S3 Standard equivalents then Azure Blob and GCP cloud storage costs are:</p><ul><li>Azure (Hot) Blob storage <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/">costs</a> a flat $0.0184 per GB per month or $18.4K per 1PB per month, or about 85% of AWS S3 standard costs.</li><li>GCP us-central cloud storage costs are $0.020 per GB per month or $20K for 1PB per month or about 93% of what AWS S3 standard costs. <br></li></ul><p>There are some additional costs that are associated with per 1,000 S3 operations. But we estimate in the scheme of things they don’t add more than $300/month to the above costs. As such we will ignore these costs here.</p><h3 id="what-if-we-wanted-to-copy-the-data-out-of-the-cloud">What if we wanted to copy the data out of the cloud?</h3><p>Of course none of the above cloud storage costs takes into consideration any egress charges which for AWS and GCP are $0.09 to $0.05/GB per month and $0.12/GB, respectively. So if you wanted to move the active 200TB of your 1PB of data out of the (AWS or GCP) cloud each month you would need to add it would cost you another ~$14K/month (on average) with AWS S3 and $24K/month with GCP. <br></p><p>For Azure they don’t appear to have a standard egress charge but rather charge per operation and bandwidth used. We would guess (although we haven’t verified this) that the costs would be comparable to AWS S3 standard egress charges. <br></p><p>Of course there would be no direct charge to move the 1PB of data center data around. You would incur bandwidth costs depending on where you moved it. But the server costs are already accounted for in the costs above. <br></p><h3 id="the-private-cloud-onprem-equivalents-software">The Private Cloud/OnPrem Equivalents: Software</h3><p>First off, you need equivalent software. MinIO offers that (and more) with its S3 compatible, feature rich object storage suite. It is literally a private cloud, drop-in equivalent for AWS. While MinIO is open source, it does offer two tiers for the MinIO Subscription Network. SUBNET, as we call it, combines a commercial license with 24/7/365 direct-to-engineer support, security and resilience audits and other diagnostic technologies that effectively insure production deployments of our software. <br></p><p>The Standard tier is priced at .01 per GB per month and the Enterprise tier is priced at .02 per GB per month.<br></p><p>For our PB of data, that equates to 10K and 20K per month respectively. Needless to say, there is the open source option as well, which would be appropriate if your data was not mission critical. That cost is zero.</p><p>There are no egress costs. There are no per object management costs. <br></p><p>For the purposes of this exercise let’s choose the middle - the Standard plan at <strong>$10K per month for software costs.</strong></p><h3 id="the-private-cloud-onprem-equivalents-hardware">The Private Cloud/OnPrem Equivalents: Hardware</h3><p>While MinIO can run on a range of hardware from Raspberry Pis to IBM Power, we wanted to target dense JBODs for the purposes of our analysis. <br></p><p>It just so happens that through our partnership with Seagate, we have publishable pricing for a 1TB configuration of the Exos AP 2U12 (Dual AP) with two Intel Silver Xeon CPUs. It has</p><p>60 drives at 16 TB per drive delivering .96 PB raw capacity and .72 actual capacity. This assumes erasure coding factor of .75. The price for that hardware is a very reasonable $70K. Let’s choose a three year amortization schedule on that hardware to determine a monthly per GB cost. At 36 months our monthly cost for the hardware works out<strong> to $1,510 per month or $0.0015 GB/month</strong>. <br></p><p>Interested in more? Jump over to the <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware#pricing-calculator">Reference Hardware page to play with the calculator</a> to see other capacities. <br></p><h3 id="don-t-forget-the-data-center-costs">Don’t Forget the Data Center Costs</h3><p>For a data center deployment, we would need to add administration, rack, space, power and cooling costs. We could go into great detail here to determine each of these costs but in general according to the US Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/ctec_datacenterrpt_lowres.pdf">data center space</a> can be had for about $1305/NRSF (net rentable square feet) in CapEx and another $112/NRSF ( ~8.6% of CapEx) in OpEx or a total of ~$1.4K/NRSF annual cost or an extra $116 per month. <br></p><h3 id="totaling-up-the-private-cloud">Totaling Up the Private Cloud</h3><p>The cost to run your own, 1 PB private cloud, with state of the art hardware, 24/7 direct-to-engineer support, panic button access and annual performance reviews is <strong>$11,510 per month</strong>. Let’s circle back and compare that to what we calculated above.</p><h3 id="summarizing-the-one-year-costs">Summarizing the One Year Costs</h3><p>At $11,510 MinIO and Seagate represent the best economics - by a considerable amount. The combination is 47% less expensive per month than standard S3 and 33% less than S3 with Intelligent Tiering. <br></p><p>These calculations ignore AWS egress costs - which would make MinIO and Seagate less than half as expensive as Standard S3. <br></p><p>MinIO and Seagate are also 38% less than Azure’s comparable option and 43% less than Google Cloud Platform’s comparable offering. <br></p><p>The breakeven point for building your own private cloud vs. S3 Standard comes in at seven months. Thought of another way - for the price of 1PB on S3 Standard you could have almost 1.5 PBs of MinIO and Seagate.</p><p><br>The overall point is not to compete on price. </p><p>We think it is a <a href="https://blog.min.io/the-new-metrics-of-object-storage/">poor metric</a> when thinking about object storage. What we seek to detail here, is that, over time, you will get better performance, superior security, more control and additional flexibility by going on prem - without sacrificing anything on cost (indeed you gain economic advantage). That is why many innovative enterprises are engaged in large scale repatriation strategies, because they realize the cloud is here to stay and they have a choice about what cloud that is - and they are picking the private cloud.</p><p>Feel free to disagree with us.

		<h2>Introduction to Makefiles</h2><p>
    I often use Makefiles in some of my projects.<br>
    I really like the flexibility it gives, and I often find myself writing a Makefile instead of a simple shell script to automatize tasks.
</p>
<p>
    So here's a little crash course.<br>
    I'll obviously only cover the basics, but I hope this will give you a good idea on how you could improve your workflows using Makefiles.
</p>
<h3>About Make</h3>
<p>
    Make was developed in 1976 mainly as a build automation tool, to produce executable files or libraries from source code.
</p>
<p>
    While it excels as a build system, it can also be used for a lot of different things.<br>
    If you do write shell scripts to automatize certain tasks, you'll be able to use Makefiles instead.<br>
    As we're going to see, a Makefile can have several advantages over a regular shell script.
</p>
<p>
    This tutorial will only be focused on the GNU version of Make, as it's the most widely used and the most powerful.
</p>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>
    First of all, when you invoke the <code>make</code> command, it will look for a file named <code>Makefile</code> in the current working directory.<br>
    This is the default, but note that a specific Makefile can be used with the <code>-f</code> flag, followed by the file name or path.
</p>
<p>
    If such a file is found, it will by default execute the <code>all</code> target.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Make is target-based system.</strong><br>
    Your Makefile can specify multiple targets, and targets may be executed individually when invoking <code>make</code>. But more on this later.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For now, we'll just start by creating a basic <em>hello world</em> example.</strong>
</p>
<h4>hello, world</h4>
<p>
    In some directory, create a file called <code>Makefile</code> with the following content:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    echo "hello, world"
</pre>
<p>
    <code>all</code> is the target name. Target definitions are followed by a colon sign.<br>
    As mentioned earlier, <code>make</code> will by default look for a target called <code>all</code>. So this is our main entry point.
</p>
<p>
    Inside the target, you'll simply execute shell commands.  
    Here, we print the <em>hello, world</em> string, using the shell's builtin <code>echo</code> command.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note that target commands need to be indented with at least a single tab.</strong><br>
    <strong>While spaces can be used elsewhere for indentation, tabulation is mandatory inside a target.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now from a command prompt, <code>cd</code> to that directory and type <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <code>make</code> will read the <code>Makefile</code>, and execute the <code>all</code> target, giving the following output:
</p>
<pre>echo "hello, world"
hello, world
</pre>
<p>    
    As you can see, <code>make</code> will first print the full command, before printing any output.<br>
    This can be disabled by using an <code>@</code> sign before the command:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    @echo "hello, world"
</pre>
<p>
    Now the output is simply:
</p>
<pre>hello, world
</pre>
<h4>Additional targets</h4>
<p>
    You can define as many targets as you want.<br>
    For instance:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    @echo "hello, world"

foo:
    
    @echo "hello, foo"

bar:
    
    @echo "hello, bar"
</pre>
<p>
    While invoking <code>make</code> will still only execute the <code>all</code> target, the <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code> targets can be executed individually by specifying their names:
</p>
<pre>$ make
hello, world

$ make foo
hello, foo

$ make bar
hello, bar
</pre>
<h4>Target dependencies</h4>
<p>
    A target may depend on another target, or on multiple other targets.<br>
    This is called a <strong>prerequisite</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Prerequisites follows the target name:
</p>
<pre>foo: bar
    
    @echo "hello, foo"
</pre>
<p>
    Here, the <code>foo</code> target depends on <code>bar</code>. This means that when <code>foo</code> is about to be executed, <code>bar</code> will be executed first.
</p>
<p>
    Multiple prerequisites are simply separated by a space:
</p>
<pre>foo: bar all
    
    @echo "hello, foo"
</pre>
<p>
    Here, upon executing <code>foo</code>, <code>make</code> will start by executing <code>bar</code>, then <code>all</code>, and finally <code>foo</code>.
</p>
<p>
    And obviously, chaining works too:
</p>
<pre>all: foo
    
    @echo "hello, world"

foo: bar
    
    @echo "hello, foo"

bar:
    
    @echo "hello, bar"
</pre>
<p>
    <code>all</code> depends on <code>foo</code>, which depends on <code>bar</code>. So when invoking <code>make</code>, you'll get the following output:
</p>
<pre>hello, bar
hello, foo
hello, world
</pre>
<p>    
    And you can also manually execute <code>foo</code> by typing <code>make foo</code>, which will give:
</p>
<pre>hello, bar
hello, foo
</pre>
<h4>Error handling</h4>
<p>
    <strong>A very nice thing about <code>make</code> is that it does error handling for you.</strong><br>
    If a command returns a <strong>non-zero</strong> exit status, <code>make</code> will report the error and <strong>abort execution</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    This means that if a command fails inside some target (which may be a prerequisite of another target), the whole execution will stop.<br>
    So you don't have to do any manual error checking, as you would/should do with a shell script.
</p>
<p>
    For instance:
</p>
<pre>all: foo
    
    @echo "hello, world"

foo: bar
    
    @echo "hello, foo"

bar:
    
    @echo "Executing false"
    @false
    @echo "hello, bar"
</pre>
<p>
    Note that in the <code>bar</code> target, we execute the shell's <code>false</code> command, which always returns a non-zero exit status.<br>
    Now if we invoke <code>main</code>, we'll get the following output:
</p>
<pre>Executing false
make: *** [bar] Error 1
</pre>
<p>
    <code>make</code> will execute <code>all</code>, which needs to execute <code>foo</code>, which needs to execute <code>bar</code>.  
    <code>bar</code> will print the first message, and then execute the <code>false</code> command.
</p>
<p>
    As it returns a non-zero exit status, this is detected as an error, and execution is stopped.<br>
    The remaining message in <code>bar</code> will not be printed, and the <code>foo</code> and <code>all</code> targets won't be executed.
</p>
<h4>Debugging</h4>
<p>
    Also note that you can obtain detailed informations about how <code>make</code> reads your Makefile using the <code>--debug</code> flag.<br>
    With the previous example:
</p>
<pre>$ make --debug
Reading makefiles...
Updating goal targets....
    File `all' does not exist.
        File `foo' does not exist.
            File `bar' does not exist.
        Must remake target `bar'.
Executing false
make: *** [bar] Error 1
</pre>
<h4>Variables</h4>
<p>
    You can also define variables inside your Makefile.<br>
    Variables are defined outside targets, and can be referred to with a <code>$</code> sign and parenthesis:
</p>
<pre>HELLO := hello, world

all:

    @echo "$(HELLO)"
</pre>
<p>
    Variables may also be overridden when invoking <code>make</code>, giving extra flexibility.<br>
    For instance, with the example above:
</p>
<pre>$ make HELLO="This is a test"
This is a test
</pre>
<p>
    We'll cover more about variables later.
</p>
<h3>Real life example - Build system</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Now that we have covered the basics, let's take a more useful example.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We'll create a simple build system for the C programming language.<br>
    The goal is to compile C source files, and to produce an executable.
</p>
<p>
    We'll start by a very simple build system, and work on it step by step to achieve a more generic one.
</p>
<h4>Project structure</h4>
<p>
    Here's the basic project structure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>build</code> (directory)</li>
    <li><code>Makefile</code></li>
    <li>
        <code>source</code> (directory)
        <ul>
            <li><code>main.c</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    We have a <code>build</code> directory for the final executable and temporary files, the Makefile, and a <code>source</code> directory with a single <code>main.c</code> file.
</p>
<p>
The <code>main.c</code> file is a basic <em>hello world</em> program:
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main( void )
{
    printf( "hello, world\n" );
    
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>Producing a simple executable</h4>
<p>
    We'll start with a very simple <code>Makefile</code> that invokes the <code>clang</code> C compiler.<br>
    You can obviously replace it with <code>gcc</code> if you want:
</p>
<pre>all:
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror source/main.c -o build/main
</pre>
<p>
    When invoking <code>make</code>, it will compile the <code>source/main.c</code> and produce an executable in <code>build/main</code>.<br>
    Dead simple.
</p>
<h4>Compiling multiple files</h4>
<p>
    Now let's say we want to compile multiple C files to produce the executable.
</p>
<p>
    We'll first create a function named <code>hello</code> in the <code>source/hello.c</code> file:
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "hello.h"

void hello( void )
{
    printf( "hello, world\n" );
}
</pre>
<p>
    And we'll also add the corresponding header in <code>source/hello.h</code> with the function prototype:
</p>
<pre>#ifndef HELLO_H
#define HELLO_H

void hello( void );

#endif
</pre>
<p>
    Our <code>main.c</code> file will then call the <code>hello</code> function:
</p>
<pre>#include "hello.h"

int main( void )
{
    hello();
    
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
    Now the <code>Makefile</code> could simply be:
</p>
<pre>all:

    @clang -Wall -Werror source/hello.c source/main.c -o build/main
</pre>
<p>
    However, this is not really flexible, and this is usually not how individual files are compiled.<br>
    Instead, we'll produce an <strong>object file</strong> for each C source file, and <strong>link them together</strong> to produce the final executable:
</p>
<pre>all:

    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    @clang -Wall -Werror build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
</pre>
<p>
    Note the additional <code>-c</code> flag, needed to tell the compiler to produce an unlinked object file, instead of an executable.
</p>
<p>
    But we obviously want the compilation to happen in separate targets, so we'll create a specific target for each C source file.<br>
    The <code>all</code> target will depend on these, and be responsible for linking the executable:
</p>
<pre>all: main hello
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    
hello:
    
    @clang -Wall -Werror -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
</pre>
<p>
    Also notice that the compiler flags (<code>-Wall -Werror</code>) are now repeated in each target.<br>
    Time to create a variable:
</p>
<pre>CFLAGS := -Wall -Werror

all: main hello
    
    @clang $(CFLAGS) build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @clang $(CFLAGS) -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    
hello:
    
    @clang $(CFLAGS) -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
</pre>
<p>
    This is obviously better, and it also mean we can now override the compiler flags when invoking <code>make</code>:
</p>
<pre>$ make CFLAGS=-Weverything
</pre>
<p>
    It might also be a good idea to create a variable for the compiler itself:
</p>
<pre>CC     := clang
CFLAGS := -Wall -Werror

all: main hello
    
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c source/main.c -o build/main.o
    
hello:
    
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c source/hello.c -o build/hello.o
</pre>
<p>
    So if you want to use <code>gcc</code> instead of <code>clang</code>, you can simply use:
</p>
<pre>$ make CC=gcc
</pre>
<p>
    And we should also add some output:
</p>
<pre>    
CC     := clang
CFLAGS := -Wall -Werror

all: main hello
    
    @echo "Linking executable"
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) build/hello.o build/main.o -o build/main
    
main:
    
    @echo "Compiling main.c"
    @$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c source/main.c …</pre></div></div>

                        The Emulator Framework was conceived, designed, and implemented by Steven Goodwin, between 2011 and 2020.

                    <p>
                        It is a system to build emulators, assemblers, disassemblers, and assorted tools
                        using a single description language.

                    <p>
                        The code is too much of a 'work in progress' to release, at the moment, but will
                        find its way onto Github at some point. But you can see the resultant examples on 
                        these pages. It truly does work!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>âœ�ï¸� Going meta - Working through a programming problem to understand problem solving techniques.</p><div>
        <p>The technical skills of computer programming fall under two broad categories, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The first category includes things like learning language syntax, constructs, and patterns. I would summarize it as the ability to connect and utilize the myriad, "tools of the trade" -- languages, frameworks, APIs, libraries -- to create software. There's usually tutorials for these things.</p>
<p>The second category includes things that are a little bit harder to put your finger on, but can probably be best described as problem solving. It's the ability to analyze, troubleshoot, debug, or solve a problem. It's the ability to reason with abstract ideas and turn them into code.</p>
<p>There is for sure some overlap between these two categories, but this is how I like to think about it.</p>
<p>It's hard to be specific about what it takes to be good at problem solving. I believe that's because we all have a slightly different perception of the world around us. Everyone learns differently. There must, however, be at least some techniques that I might learn from you, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Problems like the one I am about to share can be great tools for learning about problem solving. This one's from Project Euler. My intention is not to simply spoil the answer. I want to share my process of figuring it out, with the hope of being able to pinpoint some specific strategies that can be used to solve all kinds of problems.</p>
<h2 id="thechallenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>You can find the original problem statement <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=79">here</a>. It's short, so take a moment to read through.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The challenge is to determine what the shortest possible secret number is. Here's an excerpt from the keylogger file.</p>
<pre><code>...
160
689
716
731
736
...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="firststeps">First steps</h2>
<p>I began by sitting down with pencil and paper to write some numbers from the list. Writing helps me begin to think about the problem.</p>
<p>I thought about what these numbers in the list could tell me about the secret number. Maybe I could find a way to at least figure out its length. There are about fifty numbers in the list, so maybe that number is somehow correlated to the secret number.</p>
<p>These were a few of the questions going through my head. If the answers seem super obvious to you, then congratulations, you might be smarter than me. What's most important during the first steps is that you ask questions.</p>
<p>I realized pretty quickly that no, the length of the list I was given didn't tell me much, but you've got to start somewhere. Next, my thoughts turned to the fact that each number was three digits long.</p>
<p><em>What if I was given a list of two-digit numbers, or even a list of just one-digit numbers? What could that tell me about the length of the secret number? Is there something special about three-digit numbers in particular?</em> These were valuable questions to ask, because it helped me to simplify the problem.</p>
<p>I made a list of one-digit numbers and tried to think about how I might be able to solve the same problem with that instead.</p>
<pre><code>6
2
1
0
</code></pre>
<p>Given a list like this as clues, I could say for certain that the secret number has at least a 6,2,1, and 0, but I also loose essential information about the problem: The order that the numbers appear in. A list of one-digit numbers is too ambiguous. The secret number could be <code>6210</code>, <code>2601</code>, or any other combination, and I would have no way of knowing which one is correct.</p>
<p>A list of two-digit numbers might be nice. It's less to think about, yet is still able to convey the needed information. From this point forward, I decided to think about the list as two-digit numbers, rather than three-digit numbers.</p>
<h2 id="possibleoptionmaintainasortedarray">Possible option: Maintain a sorted array</h2>
<p>At this point, I still wasn't sure how to solve the problem on paper, so I decided to try and work backwards. I wrote down a random number and then picked a few pairs of digits from it to try and reconstruct my own version of the problem. I decided to go through each number in the list and write down the digits as if they were being inserted into some kind of array.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I realized an approach like this would not be very practical because it still leaves room for ambiguity.</p>
<p>In the example above, its clear that 5 is before 2, but if I continue to add the digits from the next number, I can't tell if the 1 should come before or after the 5. It's the same problem for the 8: I know it should come before the 2, but the data says nothing about if it should be before or after the 1, or the 5.</p>
<p>Even if I had another data point to disambiguate the clues -- <code>51</code>, for example -- sure, it would tell me that the 1 is in the correct spot between 5 and 2, but I already get the feeling that trying to write code to account for switching numbers around in an array is not going to be practical, and that there is probably an easier way.</p>
<p>Writing it out this way helped me realize that the help of some sort of data structure would be useful for solving this problem.</p>
<p>So now the question is, <em>what kind of data structure could help model this problem?</em> To help with this decision, I thought about what data is actually provided in the problem. Using the example above, the list of numbers reads as:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 "comes before" 2</li>
<li>1 "comes before" 2</li>
<li>8 "comes before" 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Each number in the list provides helpful clues, but the problem is that it's difficult to keep track of how each clue ultimately fits together. I tried to think of some kind of data structure that would be able to represent each clue individually, but also as a whole.</p>
<p>A directed graph seems to be a pretty natural fit to represent this information. Each node could be a digit, and the edges between nodes could represent the relationship between them.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I felt good about using a graph to solve the problem, but there were still some questions that I had to figure out.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would I know when the graph has enough information to to be able to get the secret number? In other words, how can I know when my answer is conclusive?</li>
<li>How could the graph be read or interpreted programmatically to produce the secret number?</li>
<li>What if a secret number had more than one of the same digit? Would that ruin my approach?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtoknowwhentheanswerisconclusive">How to know when the answer is conclusive</h2>
<p>To help answer this question I used the same technique of creating a simplified version of the problem and working backwards. Pretend now that 157 is the secret number. How many edges between the nodes would it take to definitively say that 1 comes before both 5 and 7, and 5 comes before 7? The answer is three edges for this particular graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, the order is known when number of edges are equal to the number of nodes. <em>Is it that simple? Can we know what the secret number is if the number of edges are equal to the number of nodes?</em></p>
<p>In this example, yes, but it doesn't hold true for the general case. By creating more examples, I start to find a relationship between the number of nodes, and the number of edges. Have a look at what four and five-digit secret numbers look like as a graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After drawing a few of these, I could begin to see a pattern emerge. As the number of nodes increase, the number of edges increase like, <code>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ..</code>.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to look for patterns, because it means that there's an equation which can be used to represent some aspect of the problem. Here the pattern showed me what condition to use in order to know when my answer could be considered conclusive. This is the equation that represents that pattern, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_6.png"></p>
<h2 id="readingthegraphtofindtheanswer">Reading the graph to find the answer</h2>
<p>A hand-drawn graph helps to visualize the approach of solving this problem, but I knew that I would also need to keep in mind how the graph could be represented with code. Specifically, how to programmatically traverse the graph to produce a result.</p>
<p>After staring at the examples for a bit longer, I realized an obvious and helpful property about the graph.</p>
<p>The nodes with the most outward edges come before those with less outward edges. Additionally, the number of edges for each node differ by exactly one. This means that the first digit of the secret number should have the most outward edges, while the last digit would not have any outward edges.</p>
<p>This property made logical sense to me, and was something that could be easily translated into code.</p>
<h2 id="duplicatedigits">Duplicate digits</h2>
<p>A secret number with more than one of the same digit could cause problems with my approach. This was something that worried me as I was working, because it was not clear how to know which two nodes to put the edge between. For example, take a look at 1030 as the secret number, and imagine the digits given in the following order:</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are multiple ways to draw the graph because there are two 0's. There should still be only one "correct" way. Creating a correct graph might depend on the order in which the digits are given. I might need to think of some way to backtrack and re-connect nodes in order to end up with the correct graph.</p>
<p>The correct and incorrect graphs can be compared to understand how exactly they differ. The incorrect graph has a circular dependency: 3 comes before both the orange and blue 0's, but then the blue 0 comes before 3, which is contradictory.</p>
<p>Another difference is that the correct version is the only one that satisfies the property mentioned above, where the number of each node's edges differ by exactly one. This property should always be true for any secret number modeled with the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point, I decided to put the question of duplicate digits on hold. It looked like this would break the approach that I had planned to use. I think its possible to figure out, but it was unclear if this use case needed to be supported at all.</p>
<p>My plan was now to turn my ideas into code to see if it would produce the correct answer.</p>
<h2 id="translateideastocode">Translate ideas to code</h2>
<p>This part went by pretty quickly because I had formed a good understanding of the problem, as well as an approach for how to solve it. I picked Python for no particular reason, …</p></div></div>

				<p><strong><span size="6" color="#5040ae"><em>W</em></span></strong>e previously covered average lifetime value by looking at actual past purchase lifetimes.&nbsp; There is however an alternative formulation that is widely used that doesn't look necessarily at averaging each individual lifetime value, but instead just uses the averages in customer behavior.&nbsp; Let us elaborate with each formula.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Order Size</span><br></h2>  <p>The Average Order size is given by&nbsp; AO = Total Revenue / Number of Orders. This treats all orders from everyone the same, as if they came from each individual equally.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Frequency Of Orders</span></h2>  <p>The Average Frequency of Orders is given by AF = Number of Customers / Number of Purchases.&nbsp; This doesn't measure true frequency because you don't know the actual time between purchases.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Lifetime</span></h2>  <p>The Average Lifetime is given by AL = sum of Customer Lifetimes / Number of Customers.&nbsp; However, because you can't necessarily wait 20 years to see the total customer lifetimes, it is sometimes suggested to use 1 / churn rate percentage to estimate this value.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">The Average Customer Lifetime Value</span></h2>  <p>The Average Customer Lifetime Value is then given by AvgCLV = AO*AF*AL.&nbsp; It is just the previous formulas multiplied with each other to get the "average" in lifetime value.<br></p>  <h2><span size="4">Correlated Values and Problems with using the "<em>Average</em>"</span><br></h2>  <p>The above formula, while simple, has a few glaring flaws that are not fixable.&nbsp; Customers don't behave like the average, and the "average" lifetime value will be terribly misleading.&nbsp; When you multiple the averages together, you assume that each factor AO, AF,&nbsp; and AL are statistically independent.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not.&nbsp; When the customer is a high lifetime value customer, the Average Order sizes are larger, the Average Frequency is greater, and the Average Lifetime is greater, for example.&nbsp; When the customer is a low lifetime value customer, the Average Order sizes are smaller, the Average Frequency is less, and the Average Lifetime is shorter, for example.<br></p>  <p>Let's work through an example where we can see the effect of correlation on the "average" lifetime value.&nbsp; For simplicity, assume the correlation is perfect, which won't be too far from the actual case.&nbsp; These numbers come from a Starbucks case study.&nbsp; For Starbucks, the average frequency is AF = 4.2 visits per week.&nbsp; The average order size is AO = $4.05 per visit.&nbsp; The estimated lifetime is 20 years, so AL = 52 weeks * 20 years.&nbsp; This gives the Average Customer Lifetime Value as<br></p>  <p>AvgCLV = $4.05*4.2*52*20 = $17,690.40<br></p>  <p>We can look at the correlation effect as equivalent to adding an extra term inside the formula for Average Customer Lifetime Value</p>  <p>AvgCLV = (AO+x)(AF+x)(AL+x)</p>  <p>When a customer is high lifetime value customer, x is added to all the base values.&nbsp; When a customer is a low lifetime value customer, you can think of subtracting x from all the base values.&nbsp; Now let us look at what happens to the Starbucks customer when they are a high value lifetime customer by assuming it raises all the values by 20%.<br></p>  <p>HighAvgCLV = ($4.05*1.2)*(4.2*1.2)*(52*20*1.2) = $ 30,569.01<br></p>  <p>This value is almost twice the baseline. And let's look similarly at what happens when the Starbucks customer is a low value lifetime customer by lowering all the values by 20%.<br></p>  <p>LowAvgCLV = ($4.05*0.8)*(4.2*0.8)*(52*20*0.8) = $9,057.48<br></p>  <p>This value is almost half the baseline value.&nbsp; High and Low value customers might not be a problem with there were an equal number of both types, but if you recall the L-Shaped distribution from the previous post on "Why The Average Customer Lifetime Value is Not Enough", the majority of customers come from the low value of the distribution with a long tail, since roughly 80% of revenue is generated by only 20% of the customers.<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.revenueforesight.com/uploads/1/3/4/4/134486339/clv-presentation-4-001_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>The real-world effect of correlation on the terms in the "average" lifetime value AvgCLV = AO*AF*AL, is to make the calculation highly biased and misleading by making the L-shaped distribution have greater extremes in the tails and making it more L-shaped.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the true lifetime value of customers affects the profitability of your business, you cannot depend on the "average" formulas. Given that there is a cost to acquiring customers (through ads and incentives), then knowing the true lifetime values is a key piece of information that you need for your business.<br></p>  <p>We can help you with discovering what the true lifetime value is of each and every customer in your business, because we have AI software that forecasts what each individual customer's lifetime value will be, and what their stream of future purchase values will be, with high accuracy, early in their life.&nbsp; Contact us for a demo.<br></p>

        <div>
            <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an important piece of the cloud puzzle and it’s usually a source of headaches from a security point of view. Let’s try to give some pointers from a blue team perspective.</p>

<p>If you are a security team that just inherited a bunch of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accounts, this guide is for you.</p>

<h2 id="identities-and-roles">Identities and Roles</h2>

<p>IAM revolves around the concept of <strong>identity</strong>: an (authenticated) entity to which authorization grants are applied.</p>

<h3 id="members">Members</h3>

<p>In Google Cloud, identities are called <strong>members</strong> and are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>User</strong>: defined by a Google Account</li>
<li>A <strong>Group</strong>: defined by a Google Group</li>
<li>A <strong>domain</strong>: a super group representing all accounts under a gsuite/workspace domain</li>
<li>A <strong>Service Account</strong>: an account for an application rather than an end user</li>
</ul>

<p>To make things spicier, there are also two special members that you are going to hate and you want to make sure they will <em>never be used</em> (unless valid business reasons):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>allAuthenticatedUsers</strong>: a special group comprised of everyone on earth with a google account (yes)</li>
<li><strong>allUser</strong>: anyone on the internet, authenticated or not</li>
</ul>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan your IAM policies and make sure that <code>allAuthenticatedUsers</code> and <code>allUsers</code> are never used</li>
<li>or even better, set up an organizational policy to only allow members from your gsuite/workspace domain</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>

<p>You assign (bind) a Role to a Member to grant that identity access to a resource. An example role is  <code>resourcemanager.projectCreator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcloud iam roles list
…
---
description: Access to create new GCP projects.
etag: AA==
name: roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
stage: GA
title: Project Creator
---
…
</code></pre>

<p>Roles are a set of <em>permissions</em> grouped together, each one representing a fine grained operation. You can’t assign permissions directly to members.</p>

<p>An example permission would be <code>resource manager.projects.create</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcloud iam roles describe roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
description: Access to create new GCP projects.
etag: AA==
includedPermissions:
- resourcemanager.organizations.get
- resourcemanager.projects.create
name: roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
stage: GA
title: Project Creator
</code></pre>

<p>Usually, every cloud service will come with a dedicated set of Roles (<a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/stricter-access-control-to-gcr/">not for Google Container Registry</a>).</p>

<h3 id="custom-roles">Custom Roles</h3>

<p>As a rule of thumb <strong>stick to standard roles</strong>, but if you have to bind a role to a member in a high level policy you might want to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles">use a custom role</a>. Custom Roles allows you to group together the specific set of permissions you need.</p>

<p>They are helpful to maintain least privilege because a role bind on a high level policy (like the Organization one) will affect way more resources.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use standard roles when the number of affected resources is limited</li>
<li>Use custom roles when the authorization grant affect too many resources</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="primitive-roles">Primitive Roles</h3>

<p>There are a bunch of roles you should be wary of: <em>primitive roles</em>. These are <code>Owner</code>, <code>Editor</code> and <code>Viewer</code>. When they are bind on the Project IAM policy they translate to admin, write and read access to everything inside that project.</p>

<p>You want to be wary for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The set of permissions change over time: when Google release new cloud services, permissions for such services are included in the primitive roles. This means <strong>you have an authorization grant that change over time and you have no control over</strong>. No bueno.</li>
<li><strong>They are a bridge to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists">Access Control List</a></strong> (ACL). ACL are the legacy authorization system for some storage services such as Buckets and Bigquery. In such resources you can assign ACL grants to whoever is bind to a primitive role in the Project. This relationship <strong>adds complexity when trying to understand the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">blast radius</a></strong> of a member.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can’t escape using a primitive role, bind them to members that you will use only in “break the glass” scenarios. In practice, you don’t want a team doing their day to day operations as <code>Owners</code>.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid primitive roles</li>
<li>Do not use Access Control Lists (ACL)</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="iam-policies-and-where-to-find-them">IAM Policies (and where to find them)</h2>

<p>Roles are bind to members in an IAM Policy. Policies are organized in hierarchical layers (from top to bottom):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Organization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Folder</strong></li>
<li><strong>Project</strong></li>
<li>Specific Resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bindings will be inherited from top to bottom.</p>

<p>So if you assign <code>Storage Admin</code> to a service account in the Organization IAM Policy, the same grant will be applied to everything down (don’t do that).</p>

<p>You obviously want to be extra careful when binding roles high in the hierarchy as the authorization grant will be quite large. That’s why it’s a good idea to use custom roles to shrink it to just the permissions you need.</p>

<p>Some specific cloud resources, such as Buckets, have their own IAM policy. These are easy to overlook because they don’t have a consistent place in the google cloud admin interface.</p>

<p>The best way to <strong>get visibility over all IAM policies</strong> is to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/">create a Cloud Asset Inventory (CAI) dump</a>. CAI is, in my opinion, <strong>the most useful thing in GCP</strong>. It’s an API that will generate a json (or bigquery) dump of all the resources and IAM Policies you are currently running.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do on day one is to set up periodical CAI dumps, and then build your detections on top of them.</p>

<h3 id="maintain-the-principle-of-least-privilege">Maintain the principle of least privilege</h3>

<p>The second best thing is to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/recommender-overview">use the IAM Recommender</a>: a service that monitors how role bindings are actually used to make sure you are not over granting them.</p>

<p>Another helpful trick to know is that you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview">attach conditions to role bindings</a>. For example you can set an expiration time, or you can scope down the binding to affect only certain resources matching a pattern.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>The higher in the IAM hierarchy, the wider the scope of the authorization grant: use sporadically, be a gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Set up Cloud Asset Inventory to not miss anything</li>
<li>Use the IAM Recommender</li>
<li>Use IAM Conditions</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="notes-on-service-accounts">Notes on Service Accounts</h2>

<p>Service accounts can be of two types: google managed and user managed.</p>

<p>A user managed service account is one you manually create. To use it, you need to create a private key and embed it into your application. A service account can have multiple keys.</p>

<p><strong>Service Account keys lifecycle is your responsibility</strong>: they never really expires, are hard to audit (you don’t see which key has been used from the audit logs). From day one you should start thinking how to keep track of them.</p>

<p>Personally I am a fan of wrapping keys creation into an internal service for your developers to use, but I understand it’s not always possible.</p>

<p>The best alternative is to <strong>use google managed service accounts</strong>. For example each project will come with a default service account that is used by Google Compute Engine (GCE) services (if the GCE API is enabled).</p>

<p>This means that virtual machines will transparently be identified by that service account, and they are authorized to request short-lived authorization tokens from the internal metadata service. You can configure them to use a service account of your choice and <strong>no keys are involved</strong>.</p>


<div><p>
Pro tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become a gatekeeper for provisioning Service Accounts keys</li>
<li>Use the identity of the virtual machines whenever possible</li>
<li>Are you running Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? Take a look at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a></li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/google-cloud-service-accounts-security-best-practices/">service accounts best practices</a></li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan your IAM policies and make sure that <code>allAuthenticatedUsers</code> and <code>allUsers</code> are never used</li>
<li>or even better, set up an organizational policy to only allow members from your gsuite/workspace domain</li>
<li>Use standard roles when the number of affected resources is limited</li>
<li>Use custom roles when the authorization grant affect too many resources</li>

<h3>Nov 8 2020</h3>


<p>Since I was 7 years old, I have wanted a LEGO Mindstorms robot. I will admit that in the later years it was mainly that I wanted to prove to myself that I got somewhere as it seemed so infinitely expensive back when I was younger…</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bitcynth/status/1319956429252513792" title="Tweet about it"><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/g1ZkG7sMAD" alt="LEGO Robot Inventor"></a></p>

<p>Well I finally got one!</p>

<p>I knew this thing had some capability to run <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> since that was mentioned in the product description quite predominantly, which sounded like a pretty hackable platform.</p>

<p>However, shortly after opening the box, I realized that this wasn’t at all just an update to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313">Mindstorms EV3</a>. Apparently the Robot Inventor was a slightly more expensive thing with less features and using a LiPo battery instead of AA cells.</p>

<p>Luckily I ordered it via the store’s website which means that by law I can return it within 14 days for any reason, and it allows me to open the box for inspection.</p>

<p>So after convincing some stubborn store employee that this is not a consumable product (which would remove my right to open the box), I got it returned and ordered the EV3.</p>

<p>Then two days later I finally had the thing which I have wanted for so long.</p>

<p>While I was waiting for the EV3, I was looking around at how it did MicroPython as it had this paragraph on the downloads page.</p>

<pre><code>You can now use your EV3 Brick to unleash the power of Python programming using MicroPython. Simply install the EV3 MicroPython image onto any micro SD card and boot up your EV3 Brick from it to start programming straight away. 
</code></pre>

<p>After just a few minutes of searching I found <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> which is an open source community project that allows you to run Debian on it!</p>

<p>It appears to be really well made and apparently good enough for LEGO to provide <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3">official builds</a> of it, which is what they use for MicroPython support.</p>

<p>So I just went ahead and downloaded and flashed the disk image to a microSD card with <code>dd</code>.
I then plugged in the microSD card into the EV3 controller and turned it on…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/rC3JqPiBNA" alt="EV3 kernel dmesg"></p>

<p>To my surprise, after applying power I was pleased to see kernel dmesg output scrolling out on the LCD of the EV3 on the first try!</p>

<pre><code>robot@ev3dev:~$ uname -a

</code></pre>

<p>After playing around with it for about two minutes, I realized something… this thing runs Debian with a pretty damn complete package repository (it has ~64000 packages and normal amd64 Debian has ~66000 packages), can this thing run BIRD?</p>

<p>I assumed that if the ARM926EJ-S CPU can run Debian and stuff it can probably run a very minimal BIRD config, however I wasn’t so sure about the 56MB of RAM.</p>

<p>But well you won’t know if you don’t try :p</p>

<p>So I just went ahead and typed <code>sudo apt install bird</code> and pressed enter…</p>

<pre><code>robot@ev3dev:~$ sudo apt install bird
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Suggested packages:
  bird-doc
</code></pre>

<p>(this was actually painfully slow as this thing doesn’t have a powerful CPU in the slightest)</p>

<p>As soon as I saw <code>bird-doc</code> I realized that yes it did at least have BIRD in the repo so that was a good first step.</p>

<p>I am only installing BIRD 1.6.3 here as it will probably use less resources than BIRD 2 if I only run the IPv6 daemon and disable the IPv4 daemon.</p>

<p>I then wrote a <a href="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/gv3GvwzBGH">quick little bird config</a> to let the EV3 (AS202314) announce 2a0d:1a45:666::/48 to my home router (AS210089), and the home router will then deal with the rest.</p>

<p>I applied that and wrote the other end of the config on my home router and applied that too.</p>

<p>Then I went to the <a href="http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/">NLNOG RING Looking Glass</a> and I saw the /48 show up as announced by AS202314!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/KVCU9bynjB" alt="NLNOG RING Looking Glass"></p>

<p>I then sent it to a friend who pointed out only about half of his sources could see the route, and well turns out I forgot to give AS202314 an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure">RPKI ROA</a> for the prefix, so I added that.</p>

<p>Then just for demo purposes I installed nginx which worked surprisingly well, so then I had a website I could access at http://[2a0d:1a45:666::]/ <sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This was surprisingly easy to get working. Hats off to the <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> people for making this Debian derivative for the EV3.</p>

<p>While having the EV3 sitting there announcing a /48 of IPv6 is not useful in itself, this shows off how flexible the platform is. The fact that I can do this silly thing means that I can do much cooler things that don’t involve BGP on this, like running web servers and other things.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>This year, I have been writing more than even before over. In this article, I would like to discuss some of the reasons for writing and provide some thoughts on each.</p>
<h2 id="writing-to-remember">Writing to Remember</h2>
<p>This is probably the most obvious reason to write for a lot of people. Having written down a piece of information, you can come back later and recall it. Historical context can be invaluable for decision making, and often covers information that is not readily available anymore.</p>
<p>The key here is being able to find notes later on. Paper-based ones can be sorted by topic or chronologically, digital ones can be searched for.<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>As an aside, I find paper notebooks really clumsy in this regard. They make a decent “staging area” to quickly capture information, but are terrible to find anything in unless you take care to maintain an index. Index cards can at least be reordered instead.</span></span> Formats can be useful here too, for example by supporting embedded code blocks or graphics.</p>
<h2 id="writing-to-solve-problems">Writing to Solve Problems</h2>
<p>Early this year, before the pandemic hit Europe, I saw Paulus Esterhazy’s talk <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7-2DW-KDV4&amp;t=1429s">Angels Singing: Writing for Programmers</a></em> at <a href="https://clojured.de/">clojureD</a>. It contained this great quote of Milton Friedman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you cannot state a proposition clearly and unambiguously, you do not understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/HammockDrivenDev.md">another talk</a>, Rich Hickey explained his notion of using notes as an extension of his working memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we have a problem, in general, because we’re just being asked to write software that’s more and more complex as time goes by. And we know there’s a 7 +/- 2 sort of working memory limit and as smart as any of us are, we all suffer from the same limit but the problems that we are called upon to solve are much bigger than that. So what do we do if we can’t think the whole thing in our head at the same time? How can we work on a problem with more than nine components. What I’m going to recommend is that you write all the bits down.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>But if we look at the 7 +/- 2 thing, we could say we can juggle seven to nine balls but if you can imagine having an assistant who every now and then can take one of those out and put a different color in and you can juggle balls of 20 different colors at the same time as long as there are only nine in the air at any one point in time. And that’s what you’re doing, you’re going to sort of look around at all these pieces and shift arbitrary shapes of seven into your head at different points in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing everything down allows digging deep into details and going off on tangents, and then returning to other aspects. As an added bonus, these notes can be useful in the future as well, if archived properly. I found <a href="https://orgmode.org/features.html">org-mode</a> outlines incredibly powerful for this purpose, with their foldable, tree-like structure that allows nesting sub-problems.</p>
<h2 id="writing-to-make-decisions">Writing to Make Decisions</h2>
<p>Writing is invaluable for decision making. Not only does it aid the decision process (see above), it also allows returning to a decision later and reviewing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record">Architecture decision records (ADRs)</a> are a tool established just for this purpose. The exact formats vary, and the details do not matter too much, but here are a few key points I consider essential:</p>
<ul>
<li>The motivation for the decision</li>
<li>The constraints involved</li>
<li>The alternatives to consider and their respective tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are useful in several ways: they force you to acknowledge the components of the decision, make it simple to get an opinion on the matter from someone else, and also allow you to review the (potentially bad) decision later on.</p>
<p>There is one more point: the conclusion. This is easy to forget, because once a conclusion is reached, no one wants to spend time writing it down. But if you do not write it down, the document does not tell the whole story if reviewed in the future.</p>
<h2 id="writing-to-develop-ideas">Writing to Develop Ideas</h2>
<p>This year I have seen a lot of people writing about Sönke Ahrens’ <a href="https://takesmartnotes.com/"><em>How to Take Smart Notes</em></a>, which is about taking notes as a means to develop long form writing. It popularised the idea of the <em>Zettelkasten</em>, a physical or virtual box of notes which reference each other to build an information network.</p>
<p>While I found the book quite interesting, I would not recommend it to everyone due to the significant organisation overhead involved.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>I think researchers and writers can gain a lot from this method, but others not so much. Of course, if you want to read the book, feel free to do so. It is an interesting read, and I wouldn’t call it overrated by any means.</span></span></p>
<p>That being said, I believe that if you have a digital system which can provide automatic back-links to avoid the exponentially growing amount of manual maintenance required, there is little harm in linking notes.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>, <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain">many others</a> can do so.</span></span> At the very least it will make it easier to find a note, and maybe it can aid the thinking process by exposing previously unseen connections between concepts.</p>
<h2 id="writing-to-communicate">Writing to Communicate</h2>
<p>This very article was written expressively to communicate information, and as such required some extra work for it to be effective.</p>
<p>The most important factor when writing for communication is the target audience. It dictates the format to use, and which prior knowledge can be assumed. Maximising information density by being as concise as possible is important to avoid wasting the reader’s time.</p>
<p>As an added difficulty, when writing something to be published you need to get it right the first time, there is no channel for discussing follow-up questions. The old adage in writing is “writing is rewriting”, and I very much believe that to be true in this case. Write an outline, then a first draft, then keep reading and revising it until it is just right. Maybe show it to someone you trust for feedback.</p>
<p>I personally also like to leave a draft and come back a few weeks later. This way I always have a few drafts for new articles ready for revision, until I feel that one is ready for publishing.</p>

November 8, 2020 | https://www.robinlinacre.com/command_control/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.robinlinacre.com/command_control/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Originally posted: <!-- -->2020-11-07<!-- -->. <!-- -->View source code for this page<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/RobinL/robinl.github.io/blob/dev/src/mdx/command_control.mdx">here</a>.</p><p>The phenomenal success of data driven businesses like Google and Amazon has led to increased recognition of the value of data, and a corresponding desire for new investment.</p><p>As a result, seemingly every big organisation has a new data platform that’s always just around the corner — a platform which will finally impose order on the organisation’s data and allow it to realise its data driven ambitions.  This vision of a step change in data capability is closely linked to a ‘command and control’ style of data leadership whereby solutions are designed and agreed by a small group of experts.</p><p>These platforms - if they arrive at all - never seem to deliver the step change that is promised.  Why is this such a common problem, and how can organisations realise more value from their data without falling into the ‘big bang platform’ trap?</p><h2>A Dangerous Narrative</h2><p>A root cause of later problems is the tension between an appealing narrative and a deliverable plan.  The politics of organisations tend to push towards an ambitious vision and a compelling narrative - and since senior decision makers rarely have deep experience of delivering data platforms, they can struggle to offer effective scrutiny.</p><p>The narrative usually centres around fixing the data mess once and for all by creating a new, beautifully curated data platform that contains a single version of truth for all the organisation’s data.  I think this is a compelling story because it appeals to a basic human instinct for order - capitalising on the same feeling we get when browsing the Ikea catalogue.</p><p>Unfortunately, this vision is usually undeliverable.</p><h2>Why it fails</h2><h3>The benefits are too vague</h3><p>The ultimate goal is not to deliver a platform but to enable the organisation to derive more value from its data.  Too much weight is often placed on the role of the platform in unlocking value, and this distracts from detailed scrutiny of how value will be realised.  For example, if operational efficiencies are expected, how much are these worth, and how does the platform help?  Could these benefits be delivered with current infrastructure?  It’s too often assumed that a better data platform will inevitably result in business value without enough focus on specific business problems and quantifiable benefits.</p><p>An example that illustrates the problem is the idea of the single version of the truth, which is often a key selling point of a new platform, and a big part of the ‘cleaning up the mess’ narrative.  The promise is that this will reduce complexity and duplication of work and eliminate inconsistency.  The narrative is compelling because it’s usually easy to find examples of different parts of the organisation using mutually inconsistent data.</p><p>Whilst opportunities for consolidation usually do exist, the benefits of the single version of truth are usually oversold, and many of the blockers are not due to the lack of a new platform.</p><p>There are legitimate reasons for holding different measures of the same thing.  A high profile example is the challenge of <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/public-health-england-death-data-revised/">defining the number of deaths from COVID</a>: various different definitions may be appropriate depending on the use of the statistics.</p><p>These competing user needs create tensions between the the vision and the delivery of value.  The vision promises to deliver simplicity, but this simplicity can only come at the cost of reducing the value of data to some customers.</p><h3>The delivery approach is flawed</h3><p>The vision of the ‘big bang’ platform implies some type of top-down design - a style of data leadership in which a small group of experts decide what’s best.  This could include decisions about what data to store, how to organise the data, how things should be measured and the tools available to users.</p><p>There may be wide consultation, but the assumption is that a few common solutions and patterns are used by everyone.  This simplification is an important part of the vision.</p><p>This fails to account for the complexity of real-world data.  Deep expertise about the organisation’s data generally sits relatively low down the hierarchy, with many details not written down.  It can take many months of working with a data source to understand its thorniest challenges.</p><p>This information is not something that can be distilled into a few interviews; and more generally the overwhelming complexity of big organisations’ data makes it extremely difficult to corral into a single new architecture.</p><p>Faced with the high complexity of existing systems, it's also too easy to assume that this is the result of a lack of expertise or tooling. Whilst this may be part of the story, the reality is a lot more nuanced, involving issues like underlying data quality, user needs, staff skills, or organisational culture that a new platform cannot usually solve.</p><p>As a result, whilst a top down design may superficially accommodate each dataset, it is unlikely to meet real-world user needs.  Information simply cannot flow fast enough between planners and implementers to make it work - and attempts to gather enough information can result in suffocating governance requirements.</p><h2>The role of data leaders</h2><p>If centrally designed platforms and a command-and-control style of data leadership don’t work, what does?</p><p>In a nutshell, the recipe for success is to have small delivery teams working on specific problems with well-defined business value. Data leaders should explicitly recognise that the organisation’s data problems are too complex for a small group of people to understand and solve. Teams should therefore be empowered by a flexible range of tools, and are given the freedom to find innovative solutions themselves. This provides a sustainable model for the delivery of real business value and continuous improvement.</p><p>There is still a huge role for data leaders in this delivery model, but the focus is more about creating the right conditions for success rather than designing solutions.  The key elements are as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Understanding value and prioritising work.    </strong>This means managing the portfolio of work to make sure it’s focussed on areas that have tangible business value and have a realistic prospect of success.  It also means being explicit about the tradeoffs between delivery speed and perfection and defending these choices to stakeholders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empowering teams to solve problems. </strong>  A data platform is important, but its role should be to give flexibility to users and remove barriers to data flow, not to provide cookie-cutter solutions to all problems.  The platform should empower users to try a range of different tools and approaches to help them find the best fit for their problem.  This is a critical driver of continuous innovation in a world where data tooling is rapidly evolving.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coordinate teams and drive adoption of good ideas.  </strong>Whilst individual teams should be given considerable flexibility, there is an important role for data leadership in coordinating teams and promoting information flow between them.  This is a delicate balance.  It involves encouraging ground rules and principles to emerge, and promoting (and occasionally enforcing) best practice, but falls short of designing and imposing solutions. Solutions themselves will generally originate in delivery teams, with the role of data leaders to recognise quality and encourage adoption amongst other teams.</p><p>The purpose of ground rules is to encourage transparency and re-use without significantly harming flexibility.  For example, one ground rule may be that there should be no data without metadata, and that metadata should be held in a consistent, open-source, machine readable format.  This enables coordination between teams whilst imposing very little constraint on how individual teams solve their problems.</p><p>Another principle may be of transparency and reproducibility, with a ground rule that all code should be stored in the same version control system.  This allows teams to easily see what each other are doing.</p><p>If this approach is successful, it should be very rare to need to force teams to use particular tools or implement principles. This should only happen after significant reflection on why adoption has not occurred.  Enforcement should only be used where there is ample proof of a tool or rule working in similar contexts, and a clear explanation for why the existing approach is harmful.</p></li></ul><h2>Does it work?</h2><p>Having experienced both styles of leadership,  I have been able to observe the difference in outcomes.  I am lucky to currently work on a delivery team where we are empowered to find our own solutions, and what I see is a huge amount of innovation, leading to a rapid, sustained improvement in data capability, and highly motivated staff who love their work.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Log Collection</h2>



<p>It contains a basic log, time, source system and a message. For example, when we look at the content of the “/var/log/auth.log” file on an Ubuntu server, we can see the source, time and message information.</p>



<figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log.png" alt="" srcset="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log.png 685w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log-300x22.png 300w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log-330x24.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></figure>



<p>Logs are generally collected in the following 2 ways:</p>



<ul><li>Log Agents</li><li>Agentless</li></ul>



<p>We created online lab for investigation SIEM alerts. If you are interested, you can try for free on <a href="https://letsdefend.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">letsdefend.io</a></p>



<h3>Log Agents</h3>



<p>In order to implement this method, a log agent software is required. Agents often have parsing, log rotation, buffering, log integrity, encryption, conversion features. In other words, this agent software can take action on the logs it collects before forwarding them to the target.</p>



<p>For example, with the agent software, we can divide a log with “username: LetsDefend; account: Administrator” into 2 parts and forward it as:</p>



<ul><li>message1 = “username: LetsDefend”&nbsp;</li><li>message2 = “account: Administrator”</li></ul>



<p><strong>Syslog</strong></p>



<p>It is a very popular network protocol for log transfers. It can work with both UDP and TCP, and can optionally be encrypted with TLS. Some devices that support syslog: Switch, Router, IDS, Firewall, Linux, Mac, Windows devices can become syslog supported with additional software.</p>



<p>If you want to forward your log with Syslog, you will need to parsing in syslog format.</p>



<p>Syslog Format:</p>



<p>Timestamp – Source Device – Facility – Severity – Message Number – Message Text</p>



<figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/09fig02.gif" alt=""><figcaption><em>https://flylib.com/books/1/297/1/html/2/images/1587051583/graphics/09fig02.gif</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, the maximum packet size that can be sent with Syslog UDP is 1024 bytes. For TCP it is 4096 bytes.</p>



<p><strong>3. Party Agents</strong></p>



<p>Most SIEM products have their own agent software. 3rd party agents have more capabilities than syslog because of the features they support. Some agents:</p>



<p><strong>Splunk: </strong>universal forwarder</p>



<p><strong>ArcSight</strong>: ArcSight Connectors</p>



<p>These agents are easy to integrate into SIEM and have parsing features.</p>



<p><strong>Open Source Agents</strong></p>



<p>They are generally agents that provide basic needs comfortably. However, it may not be as effective as the agent of the SIEM product itself. (Ease of installation, integration, additional features etc.)</p>



<p>Popular open source agents:</p>



<ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beats </a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nxlog.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NXLog </a></li></ul>



<h3>Agentless</h3>



<p>Agentless log sending process is sometimes preferred as there is no installation and update cost. Usually, logs are sent by connecting to the target with SSH or WMI.</p>



<p>For this method, the username and password of the log server are required, therefore there is a risk of the password being stolen.</p>



<p>Easier to prepare and manage than the agent method. However, it has limited capabilities and credentials are wrapped in the network.</p>



<h3>Manual Collection</h3>



<p>Sometimes there are logs that you cannot collect with existing agent software. For example, if you cannot read the logs of a cloud-based application with the agent, you may need to write your own script</p>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>As you can see, there are various ways to collect logs. These are agents and agentless. In cases where the agents on the market are not sufficient, you should write your own scripts.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Last week I ran a poll on Twitter to see what people considered with respect to the meaning of ‘pwd’ in Unix and Linux systems. The results were varied, for perhaps good reason.</em></p>

<p>At the end of Oct 2020 I ran a <a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1322567992551624705">brief poll on Twitter</a>, on which 82 people voted. Here’s that poll, and the results. They’re quite mixed, which at first might seem surprising. But there are reasons for that, as we’ll find out.</p>

<p><img src="https://qmacro.org/content/images/2020/11/twitter-poll-pwd.png" alt="Poll on Twitter: &quot;Fun Saturday afternoon shell poll. In Unix (and Linux), what do you think the P in $PWD (or pwd) stand for?&quot;"></p>

<p><strong>Print working directory</strong></p>

<p>The most popular option was “print working directory”. At first sight it seems logical: “print out the current working directory, i.e. where I am right now”. Moreover, the description in various versions of the manual for <code>pwd</code> help to drive home that notion. Typically we see sentences like “<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/pwd">print name of current/working directory</a>” or “<a href="https://www.mankier.com/1/pwd">print the current directory</a>”.</p>

<p>But there are lots of commands that print stuff, and are described in that way too. Take the <code>id</code> command. Here’s what one man page says: “<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/id.1.html">print real and effective user and group IDs</a>”. There’s “print” again. But the command isn’t <code>pid</code>, it’s <code>id</code>. When you think about it, many, many commands in Unix send information to STDOUT, i.e. to the terminal. That’s sort of the point of many of them.</p>

<p>This time arguably only superficially definitive, it would seem, the Wikipedia entry states, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd">page for <code>pwd</code></a>: “the pwd command (print working directory) writes the full pathname of the current working directory to the standard output”. As if to underline the hopeful authority of this statement, there are five (!) footnotes that supposedly link to resources that back this up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first footnote points to a Wayback Machine copy of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050520231659/http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/v7vol1.pdf">UNIX PROGRAMMERS MANUAL - Seventh Edition, Volume 1 - January, 1979</a>, wherein there are actually zero references to <code>pwd</code> being short for “print working directory”:</p>

<p><img src="https://qmacro.org/content/images/2020/11/programmers-manual-pwd.png" alt="excerpt from UNIX PROGRAMMERS MANUAL on pwd"></p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but this historic document carries more weight for me than other sources I’ve come across, and it only serves here to undermine the credibility of the Wikipedia entry.</p>

<p>The rest of the footnote links seem dubious at best, except for the one pointing to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#pwd-invocation">GNU Coreutils manual on pwd</a> which has it as “print working directory”. But everything else I’ve seen so far makes me think that this is a misunderstanding that has spread for obvious and innocent reasons. In addition, the one footnote in the Wikipedia page that is not used to back this claim up is a pointer to <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pwd.html">The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition’s information on pwd</a>, which almost seems like it’s actually avoiding using the word “print” at all: “return working directory name” … “The pwd utility shall write to standard output an absolute pathname of the current working directory, which does not contain the filenames dot or dot-dot.”. Very specific, very not-print.</p>

<p>So I’m thinking that “print working directory” isn’t what <code>pwd</code> stands for. In fact, “print working directory” may be common to some man pages, but on this macOS machine, with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a> heritage, we have, instead: “pwd – return working directory name”. Moreover, it goes on to say “The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the standard output”.</p>

<p><strong>Pathname of working directory</strong></p>

<p>So perhaps it really is “pathname of working directory”. That would, at least to me, make more sense. Not only does it eschew the redundancy of “print”, it also is more specific about the output - if I’m in <code>/home/dja/</code> for example, then invoking pwd will tell me that, i.e. where I am, including the whole path, and not just <code>dja</code>:</p>



<p><strong>Process working directory</strong></p>

<p>As for the other options, I do favour “process working directory”, mostly because it makes a lot of sense to me; every process in Unix has the concept of a current working directory, and that’s exactly what I’m asking for when I’m in my shell process and enter <code>pwd</code> - there’s a part in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/hgFBRZmwpSM?t=165">Unix terminals and shells</a> that explains this very well.</p>

<p>I’d love to be able to point to some old Unix sources that definitively explain the answer, but unfortunately that search has come up with very little - the <code>pwd</code> source in both the <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V5/usr/source/s2/pwd.c">5th</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yisooan/unix-v6/blob/master/source/s2/pwd.c">6th</a> Editions of Unix shed no light on this whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Present working directory</strong></p>

<p>What about “present working directory”? Well, that option seems to have legs, in the form of the Korn shell. While <a href="https://northstar-www.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/ipe-help/dbx/dbx88cc.html">one source</a> implies that the answer might well be “pathname of current working directory”, in that <code>pwd</code> just emits the value of the <code>$PWD</code> environment variable (and a variable called “print working directory” makes no sense at all) … it would seem that in ksh-land, at least, “present working directory” is what <code>pwd</code> represents. Take, for example, the <a href="https://osr507doc.xinuos.com/en/man/html.C/ksh.C.html">ksh man page</a> which states “PWD - The present working directory set by the cd command”.</p>

<p>There’s a ton of discussion, both direct and indirect, on this very question. Take for example these two entries in the Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange forum: <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/399026/etymology-of-pwd">Etymology of $PWD</a> and <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/174990/what-is-pwd-vs-current-working-directory">What is $PWD? (vs current working directory)</a>. Of course, perhaps the definitive answer will never be found, as computing history is nothing if not varied and prone to forking.</p>

<p><strong>Multics and print_wdir</strong></p>

<p>Talking of history, we could go further back to pre-Unix roots, in the form of Multics, which indirectly gave rise to Unix (originally “Unics”). In the <a href="https://multicians.org/multics-commands.html">list of Multics Commands</a>, we see, nestled amongst other similarly named commands, something that jumps out at us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>print_mail (pm)	display mail in a mailbox
print_messages (pm)	display interactive messages in a mailbox
print_motd (pmotd)	display message of the day (source)
print_proc_auth (ppa)	display process's sensitivity level and compartments
print_request_types (prt)	display list of I/O daemon request types
print_search_paths (psp)	display search paths
print_search_rules (psr)	display ready messages
print_wdir (pwd)	display working directory
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s <code>pwd</code>, and in fact, just like its sibling <code>pmotd</code>, for example, which is short for <code>print_motd</code>, it’s short for <code>print_wdir</code>. Now, given the context of the original poll being set to Unix and Linux, perhaps we must discount this information. But as someone who is fascinated with Unix history in general - how can I?</p>

<p>I guess there are few things to conclude. The history is rich and diverse, and maybe we’ll never know for sure. Perhaps, in fact, the answer will depend on whom we ask. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter … but to those who delight in minutiae, it’s a fun topic worth exploring.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the longest time felt like I didn’t fail at things. I was brought up with the mindset that if something is doable, it cannot be hard. A mindset which compels you to find harder and harder challenges.</p><p>That all changed when Flex, the Techstars company I co-founded didn’t work out. It broke me.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>What surprised me was that the network, “give first” and all of the opportunity that comes with it is great when you’re on the up but awkward, uncomfortable and at times “crickets” on the down.</p><p>Part of this I now realise is because when you’re in failure mode, you’re insufferable to everyone around you.</p><p>You carry this huge weight on your shoulders that you put on others every time you meet like a wounded animal, limping around looking to be put down.</p><p>I’m not sure if everyone has gone through this, but for me I suffered through thoughts like:<br>Will I be ever successful?<br>Will I ever be happy?<br>Will I ever have another good idea?<br>Was my idea good?<br>Can I have good Ideas?<br>Can I be good at anything?</p><p>I came to learn these can be called cognitive distortions, and the best way to stop them is to write them down and use reason and logic to disprove them.</p><p>Everyone just tells you its okay, put in their perspective, you’ll work it out - This whole experience was incredibly frustrating, how could a non founder possibly relate to the level of aspiration I had taken away from me. What is a well meaning attempt at helping often comes across as people shrugging you off.</p><p>There was a limit to what my coach could do because I convinced myself he hadn’t experienced it. How could he possibly understand what was left behind after this huge emotional debt bubble deflated.</p><p>I sought out others who’s companies had died, or who had been ousted from their own boards but it was hard to match with other failures because it was either a sufferfest of two people feeling sorry for themselves or one of you values success more than the other and you judge the others’ failure.</p><p>I didn't grieve, I tried to re-inflate the bubble inside me.</p><p>I didn’t get angry, I just wanted to get better, I just wanted to feel better without putting in the work.</p><p>I turned to reading, thinking that with over a century of modern business practices surely titans have recovered from this. Reading a gazillion business biographies, literature I now know to pop science schlop, did not help. In fact it made it worse.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember reading Lean In and it slid me into depression. How did Sheryl Sandberg career magically line up at the end? Was I on the right track? How do I get on track? Where is the track? What is the track?</p><p>I would openly talk about imposter syndrome to explain why I approached work and decisions the way I did, and came to learn that:</p><ul><li>Outside of tech many people have never heard of the concept<br></li><li>People who had, did not understand it<br></li><li>Many people thought imposter syndrome was in fact the Dunning Kruger effect and thus I was admitting to them I was a fraud.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For me, the voices in my head eventually did die off. Normalcy came about a year later when I realised I was talking about and writing about my experiences from a perspective of wisdom rather than re-hashing scar tissue.</p><p>Serendipitously after this point, I was gifted the book - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Smart-People-Fail-Rebuilding/dp/0140178112" target="_blank">When Smart People Fail </a>by another Techstars founder whose grandmother had gifted her the book after she had experienced a set back. A set back which ultimately led to the founding of her Techstars company.</p><p>Where was this book when I failed? While a subjectively unnecessary read, I read it anyway. In my personal opinion, it was probably the best thing I’ve ever read on dealing with personal failure.</p><p>I think it would have saved me months of anguish had I read it earlier, and while I truly love helping entrepreneurs and makers - my goto advice now, when someone has experienced failure and is looking for guidance is - read this book.</p><p>I think Techstars should gift this to every founder that fails, whether they leave their company, are forced out or go insolvent.</p><p>Between stories of failure, to understanding the core stages of grief that one must go through - there is something in the book for everyone.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Key things the book taught me:</p><ul><li>Failure is subjective to the victim</li><li>Failure has stages of grief that you must go through - if you skip any, you will experience prolonged pain. I can first hand attest to this.</li><li>If we treat success as a binary outcome, everything we sacrifice in the pursuit of success is meaningless when we fail.</li></ul><p>The third point is something I embraced over the year that followed. Clearly others think I have experience/advice/wisdom/ideas to share so there is value there and it made it all much less painful. If success is binary, those of us who don’t make it, lose many years of our lives for nothing.</p><p>This is a stance I fully reject and I thank Jen and the book for really teaching me this.</p><p>In full realisation of this final point - <a href="https://www.mquinn.online/failures.html">I’m committing to my failures in public.</a> We’ll see how long I can keep it up for, but for every project that didn’t hit the goal, the ideas that crash landed and the products that went unloved I’m keeping a record because these failures are not a waste of life, they are the stepping stones that when looking back in 20 years will all make sense.</p><p>Show me someone without failure and I’ll show you someone without learning.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Thanks to everyone that listened to me moan for a year about my failures.</p><p>A special thanks to fellow Techstars founder Sarah Tuneberg who gave me perspective through the journey, <span>Techstars founder&nbsp;</span>Jen Saxton who gifted me “When smart people fail” and my wife for supporting me while I put myself back together.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/exe/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTjjDo57B8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>CSS File Changes</strong>

                    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ihp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ihp</a> also supports live reloading of CSS. <a href="https://t.co/uRCCr3gkHz">pic.twitter.com/uRCCr3gkHz</a></p>— digitally induced (@digitallyinduce) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallyinduce/status/1277583045919375363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
                    

                    <p>
                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type Errors</strong>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

                    <img src="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/releases/v07082020.png" alt="Example of a status server error message">

                    <p>
                        Additionally open browser tabs will be notified about this and will refresh. This way the error is instantly visible to you.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Batteries-included</strong>

                    <p>
                        While the above steps are technically complicated, when doing actual development you will not see much of this complexity.  Lots of time have been spent to find the best approach and smoothing out all the edge cases. The whole process is very much inspired by PHP where you just make file changes and it works. The live reloading really <q>just works</q>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dev server is the heart of IHP and makes the dev process extremely productive. You get all the benefits of type-safety with the development speed you previously only got with scripting languages. If you haven't already it's time to try it out! 🚀

November 8, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/jaccard-minhash | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/jaccard-minhash">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Set similarity measure finds its application spanning the Computer Science spectrum; some applications being - user segmentation, finding near-duplicate webpages/documents, clustering, recommendation generation, sequence alignment, and many more. In this essay, we take a detailed look into a set-similarity measure called - Jaccard's Similarity Coefficient and how its computation can be optimized using a neat technique called MinHash.</p>

<p>Jaccard Similarity Coefficient quantifies how similar two <em>finite</em> sets really are and is defined as the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union. This similarity measure is very intuitive and we can clearly see that it is a real-valued measure bounded in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98461673-302d7180-21d4-11eb-9722-41f473c1fe84.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98461673-302d7180-21d4-11eb-9722-41f473c1fe84.png"></p>
<p>The coefficient is <code>0</code> when the two sets are mutually exclusive (disjoint) and it is <code>1</code> when the sets are equal. Below we see the one-line python function that computes this similarity measure.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>similarity_jaccard</span><span>(a: set, b: set)</span> -&gt; float:</span>
    <span>return</span> len(a.intersection(b)) / len(a.union(b))
</code></pre>
<h2>Jaccard Similarity Coefficient as Probability</h2>
<p>Jaccard Coefficient can also be interpreted as the probability that an element picked at random from the universal set <code>U</code> is present in both sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98462221-8dc3bd00-21d8-11eb-95bf-5a9267e88b97.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98462221-8dc3bd00-21d8-11eb-95bf-5a9267e88b97.png"></p>
<p>Another analogy for this probability is the chances of throwing a dart and it hitting the intersection. Thus we see how we can transform the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient into a simple probability statement. This will come in very handy when we try to optimize the computation at scale.</p>
<h2>Problem at Scale</h2>
<p>Computing Jaccard Similarity Coefficient is very simple, all we require is a union operation and an intersection operation on the participating sets. But these computations go haywire when things run at scale.</p>
<p>Computing set similarity is usually a subproblem fitting in a bigger picture, for example, near-duplicate detection which finds near-duplicate articles across millions of documents. When we tokenize the documents and apply raw Jaccard Similarity Coefficient for every two combinations of documents we find that the computation will take <a href="https://mccormickml.com/2015/06/12/minhash-tutorial-with-python-code/">years</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of finding the true value for this coefficient, we can rely on an approximation if we can get a considerable speedup and this is where a technique called MinHash fits well.</p>

<p>MinHash algorithm gives us a fast approximation to the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient between any two finite sets. Instead of computing the unions and the intersections every single time, this method once creates <em>MinHash Signature</em> for each set and use it to approximate the coefficient.</p>
<h2>Computing single MinHash</h2>
<p>MinHash <code>h</code> of the set <code>S</code> is the index of the first element, from a permuted Universal Set, that is present in the set <code>S</code>. But since permutation is a computation heavy operation especially for large sets we use a hashing/mapping function that typically reorders the elements using simple math operation. One such hashing function is</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463097-f7df6080-21de-11eb-8b61-a84ff7ad85de.png"></p>
<p>If <code>u</code> is the total number of elements in the Universal Set <code>U</code> then <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the random integers less than <code>u</code> and <code>c</code> is the prime number slightly higher than <code>u</code>.  A sample permute function could be</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>permute_fn</span><span>(x: int)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>return</span> (<span>23</span> * x + <span>67</span>) % <span>199</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have defined permutation as a simple mathematical operation that spits out the new row index, we can find MinHash of a set as the element that has the minimum new row number. Hence we can define the MinHash function as</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>minhash</span><span>(s: set)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>return</span> min([permute_fn(e) <span>for</span> e <span>in</span> s])
</code></pre>
<h2>A surprising property of MinHash</h2>
<p>MinHash has a surprising property, according to which, the probability that the MinHash of random permutation produces the same value for the two sets equals the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient of those sets.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463732-8229c380-21e3-11eb-9b26-04ec08bc8753.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98463732-8229c380-21e3-11eb-9b26-04ec08bc8753.png"></p>
<p>The above equality holds true because the probability of MinHash of two sets to be the same is the number of elements present in both the sets divided by the total number of elements in both the sets combined; which in fact is the definition of Jaccard Similarity Coefficient.</p>
<p>Hence to approximate Similarity Coefficient using MinHash all we have to do is find the Probability of MinHash of two sets to be the same, and this is where the MinHash Signature comes in to play.</p>
<h2>MinHash Signature</h2>
<p>MinHash Signature of a set <code>S</code> is a collection of <code>k</code> MinHash values corresponding to <code>k</code> different MinHash functions. The size <code>k</code> depends on the error tolerance, keeping it higher leads to more accurate approximations.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>minhash_signature</span><span>(s: set)</span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> [minhash(s) <span>for</span> minhash <span>in</span> minhash_fns]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>MinHash functions usually differ in the permutation parameters i.e. coefficients <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now in order to compute <code>Pr[h(A) = h(B)]</code> we have to compare the MinHash Signature of the participating sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and find how many values in their signatures match; dividing this number by the number of hash functions <code>k</code> will give the required probability and in turn an approximation of Jaccard Similarity Coefficient.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>similarity_minhash</span><span>(a: set, b: set)</span> -&gt; float:</span>
    sign_a = minhash_signature(a)
    sign_b = minhash_signature(b)
    <span>return</span> sum([<span>1</span> <span>for</span> a, b <span>in</span> zip(sign_a, sign_b) <span>if</span> a == b]) / len(sign_a)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>MinHash Signature could well be computed just once per set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus to compute set similarity, we need not perform heavy computation like Union and Intersection and that too across millions of sets at scale, rather we can simply compare <code>k</code> items of in their signatures and get a fairly good estimate of it.</p>

<p>In order to find how close the estimate is we compute the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient and its approximate using MinHash on two disjoint sets having equal cardinality. One of the sets will undergo a transition where one element of it will be replaced with one element of the other set. So with time, the sets will go from disjoint to being equal.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98465023-860e1380-21ec-11eb-8813-7cb6920bc1fd.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/98465023-860e1380-21ec-11eb-8813-7cb6920bc1fd.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows the two plots and we can clearly see that the MinHash technique provides a fairly good estimate of Jaccard Similarity Coefficient with much fewer computations.</p>

In the United States, the cold war has been declared officially over and a young Bill Clinton is set to become the 42nd president of America. The space shuttle Atlantis takes off from Cape Canaveral with meteorological instruments to study global warming as the resources tied up in the costly cold war are freed for nobler pursuits. In South Africa, white citizens vote for political reforms to end apartheid, the struggle of the past two years is coming to an end. On the British Isles, the most famous speculative attack in history has been carried out on the British Pound by a group of investors masterminded by Hungarian-American financier George Soros. On ‘Black Wednesday’ 16 September 1992, investors sell massive amounts of British Pounds, expecting a devaluation- a drop in the price of the pound against other currencies. The Bank of England buys £4 billion in order to keep the demand for the pound high, but by the next day the value of the pound has fallen by more than 10%. The Bank reports a loss of £3.3 billion, a third of which George Soros gets to keep.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2001. The September 11 attacks have just taken place prompting the formation of four new security agencies and a war on terror that would last for over a decade.
What do these two events have in common? Two things. Firstly, they are both ‘black swan’ events. ‘Black swan’ is a termed coined by Lebanese-American statistician Nicholas Nassim Taleb to describe events that have low probabilities of happening and cannot be predicted. They usually have major effects and are often wrongly explained away by historians and analysts who have the benefit of hindsight. In other words, events that seem obvious when viewed from a perspective further in time, but are unpredictable by observers in the present. Examples include; World war 1, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the housing crisis of 2008, and Donald Trump’s election.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603548997001/tSn4UkG9K.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="donald-trump-portrait-with-silhouette-style_23-2147952267.jpg"></p>
<p>More interestingly, both of these events may not have happened today. This due to the advances being made in the prediction of rare events in the field of Machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of the Artificial intelligence discipline that automates analytical model building. A model is a simple structure that captures all the features of more complicated real-world situations.</p>

<p>Machine learning is currently being considered in predicting future cyber-terrorist attacks, and is already being used to anticipate sudden changes in stock prices here, and here.</p>
<p>While Machine learning already has so many applications today in almost every sphere of human life; </p>
<ol>
<li>Technology (virtual assistants and self-driving cars) </li>
<li>Banking (fraud detection)</li>
<li>Marketing (adaptive online ads)</li>
</ol>
<p>A number of criticisms have yet to be addressed by proponents of machine learning in black swan event prediction such as;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delusional turkeys:</strong> Algorithms predict events based on past data, which is well… from the past. This has been likened to Inductive reasoning, a generalization of which is the anecdotal turkey predicting that the farmer will not kill it, based on past data which holds up until thanksgiving.</li>
<li><strong>Fighting fire with fire:</strong> Other critics have pointed out that the stock market is very complex and responds to the actions which members take. This means that algorithms that predict what humans do right now, will eventually have to predict what other algorithms will do as more traders resort to Machine learning. Eventually those algorithms will also have to predict what other algorithms predict that other algorithms will do. The same reasoning applies to terrorist attacks. What happens when the terrorists resort to machine learning?</li>
<li><strong>The enemy within:</strong> Other critics have yet opined that machines are incapable of predicting black swan events and instead are most likely to cause one like in the 2010 flash crash. This carries greater implications in predicting terrorist attacks. Implications such as strained diplomatic relations or even war.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, while the pros and cons of machine learning have not yet been fully measured, we can only say two things with the exact minimum degree of certainty with which you might be comfortable, that machine learning will predict black swan events or that it will itself be absolved as a factor in the black hole that is the quest for the prediction of black swan events. But whatever the case, like with google maps, there is no wrong turn and there certainly is no going back now.</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he state of education in Nigeria is dismal, especially in rural areas. Access to good education is scarce, and where it isn’t, it is ridiculously expensive. This is due to the enormous amount resources that go into setting up a school. Infrastructure, Licensing, Staff payment, Environmental maintenance are some of the major culprits, and rightly so.</p>
<p>In a nation ravaged by poverty, there must be ways to give access to quality education beyond the confines of the classroom, or school. <strong>This is where Digitalization comes in</strong>. </p>
<p>In this ever digital world where you have computers more and more becoming prerequisite for learning, it is wise to harness the power these devices wield and channel them towards creating a system that can cater for education with or without the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Taking Over</strong></p>
<p>Technology keeps on advancing and making life easier. People make use of their computers and cellular devices more often than not these days and this is drastically improving the way we accomplish tasks, keep records, and even deliver lecturers all over the world.</p>

<p>Technology has made it possible for students in rural areas to gain access to standard education from anywhere in the world, up to certificate level. The opportunities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>A step further</strong></p>
<p>A step further would be the harnessing of technology to suit both academic and administrative needs and processes. This is what the Project Appman brings to the table.
We envision such a time when every school would be capable of offering virtual options for every course, such that students who cannot afford to go to school, can have school meet them halfway through a simple device.
We envision a time when field trips will be turned to webinars, so that students who cannot afford to go on trips, can traverse within the screens of their devices and gain relevant experience equal to that gotten on the field. 
We envision a time when self learning can be encouraged, practiced and rewarded. A time when we can achieve equitable access to learning material and content to every individual.</p>
<p>A step further is the <strong>Project Appman</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e3d84c4e3b6158abd6f5"><div><div><p>A key contributor to stagnation could be a growing reluctance to take risk. All creation involves risk, because when embarking on the journey you rarely know the result. As Paul Graham said, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/early.html">you might fear creating something "lame"</a>.</p><p>As society develops, it could become less attractive to take risk. For example, if you are musically inclined, learning and performing the works of Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Wagner may deliver more instant rewards then creating your own musical forms. There is a large audience for the renowned, little for the unknown. In addition, someone like J.S. Bach could focus more on writing music, because he didn't have any of those four composers to listen to, and couldn't be paid for performing their works.</p><p>Similarly, as wealth grows, more people are employed to manage it. In a society with little wealth, financiers are few as there are fewer assets to trade. The mathematicians and engineers who become quants in our current age would actually have done maths and engineering in a poorer one.</p><p>These are two particular instances of a general problem whereby established paths are less risky and therefore more attractive than novel ones.</p><p>But without risk, no one will come up with new paradigms of knowledge and organisation. We need people to take risk to ward off stagnation. How can we encourage people to do so?</p><p>A potential answer to this question emerged in a <a href="https://jimruttshow.blubrry.net/the-jim-rutt-show-transcripts/transcript-of-episode-87-joscha-bach-on-theories-of-consciousness/">conversation between Jim Rutt and Joscha Bach</a>. Rutt cited a psychological experiment <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad1e/6dac677b7793836585405076e63839e99b22.pdf" title="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad1e/6dac677b7793836585405076e63839e99b22.pdf">(Dutton and Aron, 1974)</a> whereby those who just walked across a dangerous bridge were more likely to arrange a date with a member of the opposite sex immediately afterwards than those who walked over a safer bridge. The implication in the discussion is that doing something risky raises your willingness to take more risk.</p><p>In fact, Dutton and Arron state that this behaviour probably arises from what is known as the "Misattribution of Arousal". Essentially, going over a dangerous bridge induces physiological arousal, which the participant mistakes for romantic arousal. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232518962_Arousal_and_attraction_A_response-facilitation_alternative_to_misattribution_and_negative-reinforcement_models" title="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232518962_Arousal_and_attraction_A_response-facilitation_alternative_to_misattribution_and_negative-reinforcement_models">According to Allen et al.</a>, this effect even holds when someone is aware that the main source of arousal is non-romantic in nature.</p><p>Music can also induce physiological arousal: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183531" title="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183531">another study</a> finds that women, but not men, were more likely to rate a man as attractive after listening to music. Interestingly, the study notes that "high-arousing, complex music yielded the largest effects". If excitation-transfer theory holds, the same dynamic would probably apply to exercise.</p><p>This may be interesting if one wants to raise the number of couples in society. But is there a link to risk-taking in areas such as business, politics and academia? There is some evidence that becoming aware of the neutral nature of arousal can boost confidence, and therefore also risk-taking, at least in the short-term. For example, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167298245008">one study says that arousal is just part of "gearing up" to do a task</a>, and that this feeling is often wrongly attributed to diminished confidence. From the abstract (my emphasis):</p></div><blockquote><p>"People's confidence that they will do well tends to diminish as the "moment of truth" draws near. We propose that this phenomenon stems in part from individuals using their pre-task arousal as a cue to their level of confidence. Arousal that is part and parcel of "gearing up" to perform a task may be misattributed to diminished confidence... <strong>Participants in two experiments who were encouraged to misattribute their arousal to a neutral source ("subliminal noise") expressed greater confidence in their ability </strong>than did participants not able to do so"</p></blockquote><div><p>In this abstract, we have found what we are looking for, and it's slightly better than our starting point as it is much easier to attribute arousal to a normal part of doing a task than it is to find a dangerous bridge to walk across. In practice, this would be useful on a short-term horizon. For example, if you are an entrepreneur about to approach a potential customer or pitch to investors, you should attribute any nervousness to just part of doing a novel task rather than interpreting it as a sign you are about to do the coming task poorly. That could increase your confidence and reduce the probability you will abandon the effort.</p><p>Framing nervousness in this way may help people to take risk. But of course, taking a risk does not mean that it will always be successful.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We started this series with <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">an overview of the CPython VM</a>. We learned that to run a Python program, CPython first compiles it to bytecode, and we studied how the compiler works in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">part two</a>. <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">Last time</a> we stepped through the CPython source code starting with the <code>main()</code> function until we reached the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. The main reason why we spent time studying these things was to prepare for the discussion that we start today. The goal of this discussion is to understand how CPython does what we tell it to do, that is, how it executes the bytecode to which the code we write compiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>Let's briefly recall what we learned in the previous parts. We tell CPython what to do by writing Python code. The CPython VM, however, understands only Python bytecode. This is the job of the compiler to translate Python code to bytecode. The compiler stores bytecode in a code object, which is a structure that fully describes what a code block, like a module or a function, does. To execute a code object, CPython first creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Then it passes a frame object to a frame evaluation function to perform the actual computation. The default frame evaluation function is <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L889">Python/ceval.c</a>. This function implements the core of the CPython VM. Namely, it implements the logic for the execution of Python bytecode. So, this function is what we're going to study today.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> works, it is crucial to have an idea of what its input, a frame object, is. A frame object is a Python object defined by the following C struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// typedef struct _frame PyFrameObject; in other place</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_lines</span><span>;</span>         <span>/* Emit per-line trace events? */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_opcodes</span><span>;</span>       <span>/* Emit per-opcode trace events? */</span>

    <span>/* Borrowed reference to a generator, or NULL */</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f_gen</span><span>;</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>f_lineno</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* Current line number */</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>f_iblock</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* index in f_blockstack */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_executing</span><span>;</span>           <span>/* whether the frame is still executing */</span>
    <span>PyTryBlock</span> <span>f_blockstack</span><span>[</span><span>CO_MAXBLOCKS</span><span>];</span> <span>/* for try and loop blocks */</span>

<span>};</span>

<p>The most important field of a code object is <code>co_code</code>. It's a pointer to a Python bytes object representing the bytecode. The bytecode is a sequence of two-byte instructions: one byte for an opcode and one byte for an argument.</p>
<p>Don't worry if some members of the above structures are still a mystery to you. We'll see what they are used for as we move forward in our attempt to understand how the CPython VM executes the bytecode.</p>
<h3>Overview of the evaluation loop</h3>
<p>The problem of executing Python bytecode may seem a no-brainer to you. Indeed, all the VM has to do is to iterate over the instructions and to act according to them. And this is what essentially <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> does. It contains an infinite <code>for (;;)</code> loop that we refer to as the evaluation loop. Inside that loop there is a giant <code>switch</code> statement over all possible opcodes. Each opcode has a corresponding <code>case</code> block containing the code for executing that opcode. The bytecode is represented by an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, one integer per instruction. The VM keeps track of the next instruction to be executed using the <code>next_instr</code> variable, which is a pointer to the array of instructions. At the start of each iteration of the evaluation loop, the VM calculates the next opcode and its argument by taking the least significant and the most significant byte of the next instruction respectively and increments <code>next_instr</code>. The <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> function is nearly 3000 lines long, but its essence can be captured by the following simplified version:</p>

<p>To get a more realistic picture, let's discuss some of the omitted pieces in more detail.</p>
<h4>reasons to suspend the loop</h4>
<p>From time to time, the currently running thread stops executing the bytecode to do something else or to do nothing. This can happen due to one of the four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are signals to handle. When you register a function as a signal handler using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal"><code>signal.signal()</code></a>, CPython stores this function in the array of handlers. The function that will actually be called when a thread receives a signal is <code>signal_handler()</code> (it's passed to the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction()</code></a> library function on Unix-like systems). When called, <code>signal_handler()</code> sets a boolean variable telling that the function in the array of handlers corresponding to the received signal has to be called. Periodically, the main thread of the main interpreter calls the tripped handlers.</li>
<li>There are pending calls to call. Pending calls is a mechanism that allows to schedule a function to be executed from the main thread. This mechanism is exposed by the Python/C API via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_AddPendingCall"><code>Py_AddPendingCall()</code></a> function.</li>
<li>The asynchronous exception is raised. The asynchronous exception is an exception set in one thread from another. This can be done using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc"><code>PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc()</code></a> function provided by the Python/C API.</li>
<li>The currently running thread is requested to drop the GIL. When it sees such a request, it drops the GIL and waits until it acquires the GIL again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPython has indicators for each of these events. The variable indicating that there are handlers to call is a member of <code>runtime-&gt;ceval</code>, which is a <code>_ceval_runtime_state</code> struct:</p></div></div>

<p>In this article I’ll be talking about the advantages and disadvantages
of immutable data in databases. As a demonstration I’ll walk through a simple blog
application in PostgreSQL. I highly recommend this approach in many
cases, but the standard ‘caveat emptor’ disclaimer applies. Be aware
of the trade-offs you are making.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In a traditional blog application, a blog post may be defined as
follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>blog</span><span>.</span><span>article</span> <span>(</span>
       <span>slug</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
       <span>title</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
       <span>content</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What happens when the content or title of the post changes? An
<code>UPDATE</code> is performed. This destructively mutates your database,
i.e. information has been lost - it is no longer known what the blog
post contained prior to its edit.</p>

<p>The idea behind the approach detailed here is that the current state
of the blog post is not recorded, instead there is an immutable log of
events for the entire history of the application. The current
application state is a function of these events. No information is
lost.</p>

<p>This approach will only ever <code>INSERT</code> into the database. It will never
<code>UPDATE</code>. The blog post table will now look more like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>SEQUENCE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id_seq</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_revision</span> <span>(</span>
       <span>revision_id</span> <span>INTEGER</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>nextval</span><span>(</span><span>'logblog.revision_id_seq'</span><span>),</span>
       <span>timestamp</span> <span>TIMESTAMP</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>(),</span>
       <span>slug</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
       <span>title</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
       <span>content</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note the slug is no longer unique. An article is updated by
inserting a new <code>article_revision</code> with an existing slug.</p>

<p>There are some existing databases based around this concept, including
<a href="http://datomic.com/">Datomic</a> and <a href="https://geteventstore.com/">EventStore</a>, but in this article I’ll be focusing on how to
do this in PostgreSQL.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>Why would you want to do this?</p>

<p>Immutable data in databases has all the same advantages as
immutable data in general purpose languages. It is usually much
easier to reason about than mutable state. See:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)">Referential Transparency</a>.</p>

<p>This paragraph from the Datomic website explains other advantages of this
approach quite well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can data be immutable? Don’t facts change? They don’t, in fact,
when you incorporate time in the data. For instance, when Obama became
president, it didn’t mean that Bush was never president. As long as
who is president isn’t stored in a single (logical) place, there’s no
reason a database system couldn’t retain both facts
simultaneously. While many queries might be interested in the
‘current’ facts, others might be interested in, e.g. what the product
catalog looked like last month compared to this month. Incorporating
time in data allows the past to be retained (or not), and supports
point-in-time queries. Many real world systems have to retain all
changes, and struggle mightily to efficiently provide the ‘latest’
view in a traditional database. This all happens automatically in
Datomic. Datomic is a database of facts, not places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Immutable facts are great for auditing and debugging. It’s
tremendously helpful to be able to see the state of you application at
any point in time, and step through the state changes one by one. It’s
especially invaluable when working with financial data.</p>

<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>

<p>There are some trade-offs to this approach: space usage, complexity
and performance.</p>

<p>Of course, storing every change to the state instead of mutating data
will require more persistent storage space. If you’re only inserting
data your storage requirements can only ever grow.</p>

<p>In PostgreSQL, naive read queries that reduce events down into the
current application state will often be more complicated and
have worse performance; However, this can compensated for with some
additional effort.
See the <a href="#performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</a>
section for more details.</p>

<h2 id="an-immutable-blog-application-in-postgresql">An Immutable Blog Application in PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>This code is available as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/KMahoney/dcc12d3ff6a49c11cdc9">gist</a>.</p>

<p>This application should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Privately write and edit blog posts</li>
  <li>Publish revisions of posts for public viewing</li>
  <li>Delete posts</li>
  <li>Add or remove tags to posts</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schema">Schema</h3>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>SCHEMA</span> <span>logblog</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="article-table">Article Table</h3>

<p>A table representing the set of article slugs. Foreign keys can
reference this to maintain integrity. PostgreSQL does
not allow referencing the <code>slug</code> field in the <code>article_revision</code> table
as it is not unique in that table.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article</span> <span>(</span>
       <span>slug</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>CHECK</span><span>(</span><span>slug</span> <span>SIMILAR</span> <span>TO</span> <span>'[-a-z]+'</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="revision-table">Revision Table</h3>

<p>Next is an immutable log of article revisions. New articles can be
created by atomically inserting the slug into <code>article</code> and the
revision into <code>article_revision</code>. Articles can be updated by simply
inserting a new revision with an existing <code>article</code> slug.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>SEQUENCE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id_seq</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_revision</span> <span>(</span>
       <span>revision_id</span> <span>INTEGER</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>nextval</span><span>(</span><span>'logblog.revision_id_seq'</span><span>),</span>
       <span>timestamp</span> <span>TIMESTAMP</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>(),</span>
       <span>slug</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article</span><span>,</span>
       <span>title</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
       <span>content</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="publishing">Publishing</h3>

<p>Now for an immutable log of article publish events. The public will be
able to see the last published version of an article. This means it is
possible to publish an earlier revision to ‘rollback’ an article.</p>

<p>Note the timestamp when an article was published or deleted is
distinct from when the revision was created. Readers are probably more
interested in when an article was first published than when it was
first drafted.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_publish</span> <span>(</span>
       <span>timestamp</span> <span>TIMESTAMP</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>(),</span>
       <span>revision_id</span> <span>INTEGER</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_revision</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="deleting">Deleting</h3>

<p>An immutable log of article deletion events. Articles are only
considered deleted when the deletion timestamp is later than any
publish actions. This means articles can be ‘undeleted’ by
re-publishing them. No data is ever truly removed.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_deletion</span> <span>(</span>
       <span>timestamp</span> <span>TIMESTAMP</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>(),</span>
       <span>slug</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="tagging">Tagging</h3>

<p>An immutable log of tag events. It’s awkward to create a tag table
with a set of unique tag names like we do with articles, so instead we
just record tag events. This is a bit lazy as it doesn’t enforce
consistency with removed tags (i.e. you can remove a non-existing
tag).</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TYPE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>tag_event_type</span> <span>AS</span> <span>ENUM</span> <span>(</span><span>'add'</span><span>,</span> <span>'remove'</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>tag_event</span> <span>(</span>
       <span>timestamp</span> <span>TIMESTAMP</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>(),</span>
       <span>slug</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article</span><span>,</span>
       <span>event</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>tag_event_type</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
       <span>tag</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="building-views">Building Views</h3>

<p>Querying this data can get quite complicated, so it is a good idea to
break it down with views that show the current state of the
application. They make heavy use of <code>DISTINCT ON</code> to find the latest
state of each component.</p>

<p>This view is the latest deletion date for an article (if applicable)</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>VIEW</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>last_deleted_view</span> <span>AS</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>slug</span><span>)</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>AS</span> <span>deleted_on</span><span>,</span> <span>slug</span>
     <span>FROM</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_deletion</span>
     <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will want to show users the latest published content of an article.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>VIEW</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>last_published_view</span> <span>AS</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>slug</span><span>)</span>
            <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id</span><span>,</span>
            <span>pub</span><span>.</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>AS</span> <span>last_updated_on</span><span>,</span>
            <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>slug</span><span>,</span>
            <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span>
            <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>content</span>
     <span>FROM</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_publish</span> <span>AS</span> <span>pub</span>
     <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_revision</span> <span>AS</span> <span>rev</span> <span>ON</span> <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>pub</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id</span>
     <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Another piece of useful information is when an article was first
published. This is the date you usually show on an article. The last
published timestamp shows when an article was last updated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>VIEW</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>first_published_view</span> <span>AS</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>slug</span><span>)</span>
            <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id</span><span>,</span>
            <span>pub</span><span>.</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>AS</span> <span>first_published_on</span>
     <span>FROM</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_publish</span> <span>AS</span> <span>pub</span>
     <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_revision</span> <span>AS</span> <span>rev</span> <span>ON</span> <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>pub</span><span>.</span><span>revision_id</span>
     <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>rev</span><span>.</span><span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Aggregate the tags as a PostgreSQL array for convenience.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>VIEW</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>article_tag_view</span> <span>AS</span>
       <span>WITH</span> <span>last_tag_event</span> <span>AS</span>
         <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span>
          <span>FROM</span> <span>logblog</span><span>.</span><span>tag_event</span>
          <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>DESC</span><span>)</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>tag</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>tags</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>last_tag_event</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>'add'</span>
       <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>slug</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="the-publics-view">The Public’s View</h3>

<p>Here the previous views are used as building blocks to create a public
article view. Note that articles that have a deletion date later than
the last published date are not shown.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>In this series of posts, I will introduce you to the most popular software architecture types. But before we delve into the most common variants, let us talk about software architecture itself.</p>



<h2><strong>What is software architecture?</strong></h2>



<p>It is tough to write simply for such a complex topic as software architecture but let me try my best.</p>



<p>A software system is made up of individual elements. Elements could be databases, application servers, message brokers, load balancers, etc.</p>



<p>Each element has its properties and characteristics. Between these elements, there are relationships.</p>



<p>The way we structure these elements and their relationships, we call software architecture.</p>



<p>By defining such a structure, we aim to gain some benefits. Quality attributes define and describe these benefits, and it is essential to remember that they are not business logic related.</p>



<p>Software architecture is the skeleton of your application. Once you start implementation, it is tough to change it, so the right decision for architecture is crucial in the early phase of the project.</p>



<h2><strong>Quality attributes</strong></h2>



<p>Though quality attributes are not functionality requirements, they mainly arise from the functional requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By defining requirements for a software product, the business aims to enhance some competitive advantages.</p>



<p>In the best-case scenario, quality attributes gathering should come from those competitive advantages.</p>



<p>A simple example. Back in the days, I worked in a company that wanted to develop a new retail system. The business analysis showed that most of our main competitor’s customers do not like their system because it was always online. The user couldn’t even check product stocks in case of an internet outage.</p>



<p>For our new product to be competitive in the market, we had to aim for a competitive advantage. Our system had to work offline during internet outages and sync all recorded operations when the internet is back.</p>



<p>We, developers, translated that requirement into the <strong>availability</strong> quality attribute.</p>



<p>Sometimes quality attributes don’t come from requirements. Some quality attributes are enforced by constraints. Constraints could be different, from the dev team’s experience level to government regulations.</p>



<p>And last but not least, quality attributes should be measurable and testable.</p>



<h3><strong>Some of the most popular quality attributes:</strong></h3>



<h4>Availability</h4>



<p>It defines to what level the system is available to perform its tasks. Availability expands on the notion of reliability. Systems with high availability tend to be resilient to faults and errors (well, to most of them). High availability systems implement methods for fault detection and recovery.</p>



<h4>Modifiability</h4>



<p>Modifiability defines how well a system can adapt to changes. Technologies change, business requirements change. High modifiability software should be able to embrace new changes by reducing change costs and risks.</p>



<h4>Interoperability</h4>



<p>No system can live in total isolation. Interoperability quality attribute measures to what degree a software system can “communicate” with other software systems. Systems with high interoperability tend to have very well defined interfaces and implement widely accepted standards and communication protocols.</p>



<h4>Security</h4>



<p>The security of a system could be viewed from three different angles. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Confidentiality â€“ is the data well secured from users who don’t have the right to access it.</p>



<p>Availability â€“ is the data available when needed.</p>



<p>Integrity â€“ is the data well secured, so tampering and deletion are not possible.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>Well, performance is all about time. This quality attribute aims to put an upper execution time limit to the system’s tasks (no matter if the user or internal mechanisms initiate them).</p>



<h4>Testability</h4>



<p>Testability defines to what degree a system can be <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/10/24/how-to-write-a-good-unit-tests/">tested</a>. How well business and technical requirements can be simulated, observed, and analyzed. High testability systems provide a high level of isolation and abstraction of its modules.</p>



<h4>Usability</h4>



<p>Usability is about how easy it is for the user to perform tasks in the system.</p>



<p>Sound simple but believe me, usability is a real pain. Usability is even bigger pain when we talk about systems with very complex business logic and processes.</p>



<p>Every user comes with his own previous experience and opinions. That’s why usability is often based on compromises for the greater good ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>For more comprehensive list you can check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>What is the difference between software architecture and software design?</strong></h2>



<p>While software architecture aims to define the structure and relationships of the different system elements (considering all the present constraints), the software design focuses on their specific implementation.</p>



<p>If a software architecture specifies that we will have microservices with async internal communication, the software design will define how this will be implemented.</p>



<p>Do we use RabitMQ or Mass Transit, or something other? What is the format of our messages? How will the data models reflect the bounded context we have defined? The software design answers all these questions.</p>



<h2><strong>Architecting for performance (example)</strong></h2>



<p>Let us see how a quality attribute requirement affects system architecture.</p>



<p>We have a potential client who wants a very fast (performance quality attribute) reporting system.</p>



<p>The client should make decisions fast so that the reporting system’s speed is a competitive advantage for his business.</p>



<p>Currently, the client has two different systems. He queries them when he needs some data (using their operational databases, which degrade performance additionally) and combines the extracted data in an ugly excel report.</p>



<p>Back in the days, that approach worked perfectly for him, but now, this is becoming a bottleneck when his business is much bigger.</p>



<p>Our company “Drink beer and code Ltd.” receives invite to solve the problem.</p>



<p>After a complete analysis of the case, the developers come with the solution. According to the research, they think that a report’s average execution time could be lowered to 1500 ms (yeahâ€¦).</p>



<p>At this stage, dev team will not change current systems. Either way, they work well to meet the customer’s needs, and he doesn’t want to change them.</p>



<p>The Dev team plans to deploy a new SQL Server. The server will have a new analytics database and two replicated copies of the other systems’ operational databases.</p>



<p>Operational database replication is event-based.</p>



<p>A worker service extracts the data from the replicated databases, transforms it appropriately for the analytics database, and loads it into the analytics database.</p>



<p>The analytics database design is structured and optimized for the format of the needed reports. <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/10/04/optimizing-sql-queries-sometimes-two-queries-are-better-than-one/">Querying</a> the database will be very fast.</p>



<p>Finally, we have a reporting application reading the data over the analytics database and visualizing it in beautiful tables and charts.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Even with that oversimplistic example, we can see that we have introduced new elements and relationships between them to meet the desired quality attribute metric.</p>



<p>We also faced the constraint that the old systems enforced over our technical decision.</p>



<p>But in the end, we achieved the desired performance and that enhanced our client’s competitive advantage.</p>

                    <p>In many aspects of our lives, we rely on those in positions of power to lead us. The role of leaders becomes especially salient in times of uncertainty. Throughout your life, you’ve probably seen several ways leaders can respond to challenging and ambiguous situations. A transformational leader can see the opportunities in turmoil and inspire people to follow them to a better future. On the other hand, an incompetent leader will leave you to deal with everything alone. In the worst-case scenario, a destructive leader will see the potential for self-enhancement and exploit others to maximize their gain. </p><figure><img src="https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png" alt="" srcset="https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 600w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1000w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1069w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>4 Clues to Identify a Destructive Leader</figcaption></figure><h3 id="people-leave-managers-not-companies-">People leave managers, not companies.</h3><p>Incompetent and destructive leaders both create negative consequences, but the distinction between the two is essential. An incompetent leader may lack the compelling charisma to engage others to follow, but we wouldn’t call someone lacking charisma actively destructive. A <a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199755615.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199755615-e-014">destructive leader</a> intentionally and systematically behaves in a way that violates the organization’s members and stakeholders’ best interests. The extent of damage that a destructive leader can cause often goes unnoticed until it is too late (e.g., Enron), but there are clues you can look for to help you identify destructive leaders earlier. These clues reflect behaviors and attitudes that can reveal the destructive nature of an otherwise seemingly competent leader.</p><h3 id="what-causes-destructive-leadership-patterns">What causes destructive leadership patterns?</h3><p>Everyone has some characteristics that are annoying to someone who prefers a different way of behaving and working. These characteristics are inherited in our DNA and influenced by the environment in which we grew up. The genetic influence was passed down from generation to generation and is a product of evolution that helped your ancestors survive the environments they encountered. And they can help you too, as long as they don’t become distorted from early experiences of chronic fear. </p><p>In destructive leadership, typical behavior patterns become distorted into extremes powered by the brain’s more primitive parts under such circumstances. When this happens, we are in fear-mode, and a blend of fear reactions becomes our norm. These distorted patterns become habitual, and our responses to others become unhealthy. For example, suppose we experienced excessive criticism in our early development. In that case, our ego will record a perception of being diminished by important caregivers and sense that our very survival depends on not being criticized. In this case, we may learn to strive excessively for superiority to alleviate the fear of feeling inferior in our assessment of ourselves.</p><p>While a reactive pattern like this helped us survive the precise environment we were born into, in a global world, that same pattern may not. The brain’s brilliant design constructs a set of behaviors that will ensure our survival in whatever we experience in the development years to maturity. But if we move to an entirely new environment as an adult, the patterns that served us before may not translate into helpful practices somewhere else. </p><h3 id="the-reason-anxiety-and-stress-are-at-an-all-time-high-">The reason anxiety and stress are at an all-time high.</h3><p>In the last century, this phenomenon has become even more complicated. With the advancement of technology comes exposure to human systems all over the world. Transportation enables moving to any part of the globe in a day or two. As we move about rapidly from one culture to another, we find ourselves unable to understand why we are perceived positively in one environment and the opposite in another. No wonder anxiety and stress are at an all-time high, especially for those who interact in global companies. Adaptation to other cultures becomes a necessity, making self-awareness and emotional intelligence some of the most critical skill sets of our time. </p><h3 id="first-look-for-the-underlying-intention-">First, look for the underlying intention.</h3><p>Because all human systems are imperfect, and most parents do the best they can do, many of us have traces of fear behaviors that can drive others nuts. There are a few prototypical examples of these types of behaviors, including, but not limited to </p><ul><li>The constant worrier who is always second-guessing themselves,</li><li>The storyteller who seems to live in an ideal world no one else can relate to,</li><li>The dominant driver who wants everything to go their way,</li><li>The prideful judge who doesn’t realize they can’t possibly know everything there is to know about everything. </li></ul><p>When we’re talking about destructive leadership, we’re not merely referring to annoying habits unless they have become very extreme or painfully frequent. Destructive leaders have little interest in how they are perceived, so they are rarely interested in how they could improve. </p><h3 id="destructive-leaders-are-single-mindedly-self-interested-">Destructive leaders are single-mindedly self-interested.</h3><p>Generally, healthy leaders may have annoying habits, but when you look beneath the surface, two things are different: </p><ol><li>They adopt a mindset that conveys they care about their impact on others and are willing to listen, learn, and exert the choice and character to change.</li><li>They hold a positive intention toward others and work for the good of the mission and the enterprise they serve. </li></ol><p>On the other hand, destructive leaders are either:</p><ol><li>Un-coachable because they adopt a rigid mindset that conveys they don’t care about their impact on others and will use their authority to manipulate others to bend to their will. They imply, “I am who I am, so deal with it.”</li><li>They have a hidden ulterior motive for wanting and using power to serve themselves at the expense of others, the mission, or the enterprise. </li></ol><p>So, as we lay out the four clues of destructive leaders, keep two things in mind. Do you have a hunch that they are well-intended, and are they willing to work on themselves? If the answer to both is affirmative, they are probably not destructive, but just like you and me, they are trying to serve their company and grow as best they can. In these circumstances, we can mind our own business and work on our self-improvement plan rather than thinking about how annoying they are. After all, it’s temporary unless they are genuinely destructive. And then you must do everything in your power to remove them from your company, or they could take the whole thing down. </p><h3 id="clue-1-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-i-m-kind-of-a-big-deal-">Clue 1: Behaviors or words that imply “I’m kind of a big deal!”</h3><p><strong>Excessive fabrication and exaggeration that is nowhere near the truth. </strong></p><p>This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough attention from caregivers, so they do not feel special. This dilemma results in insatiable attention-seeking and an inflated need to be special, unique, or novel. The inner fear is feeling trapped in the loneliness or sadness of not being “special” enough to those who matter. Because they perceive being attention-deprived or unworthy, they feel shame, and it becomes so painful, they rebel from authority figures whom they believe could not be trusted. Instead of following appropriately, they become rebellious and provocative, conning others to go along with their fantastic plans. </p><h3 id="clues-you-will-notice-">Clues you will notice: </h3><ul><li>Exaggeration of the truth to the point of fantasy</li><li>Unapologetic self-promoting and self-aggrandizing</li><li>Excessive talking to dominate others</li><li>Pontification and fabrication of elaborate stories</li><li>Disrespect for authority figures</li><li>Disregard for rules that are contrary to their aims</li><li>Automatically dismiss ideas from others</li><li>An insatiable need to be the center of attention</li><li>Terminally individualistic, unique, or novel</li><li>External image is unusually extreme in some way</li></ul><h3 id="results-in-a-chaotic-climate">Results in a Chaotic Climate</h3><p>These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they demand attention but don’t want the restrictions that come with being front and center. When they are in the limelight, it can be exceedingly uncomfortable because they also unconsciously fail to believe they are impressive enough. So they attract attention, initiate excessive activity, and then thwart the attention this draws. This pattern makes them unpredictable, so the shadow of the climate they create around them is chaotic and confusing for others. </p><h3 id="clue-2-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-none-of-this-is-my-fault-">Clue 2: Behaviors or words that imply “None of this is my fault!”</h3><p><strong>Excessive conflict-avoidance by deflecting personal responsibility. </strong></p><p>This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough approval and acceptance. This dilemma results in insatiable approval-seeking and an excessive need to be liked by everyone, even strangers. The inner fear is to be rejected or ridiculed by others as unlovable by those who matter. Because they perceive being unacceptable to others, they feel powerless and unworthy of care. This experience can become painful and they are unable to communicate or ask others for what they need because they don’t feel they deserve it. They defer to those in authority roles and suffer quietly in dependence, hopelessness, and seen as “needy” for any shred of approval. </p><h3 id="clues-you-will-notice--1">Clues you will notice:</h3><ul><li>Complaining, blaming, gossiping about others</li><li>Disgruntled resentment of those in authority</li><li>Giving up their power and being dependent on others</li><li>Come across as “needy” and draining</li><li>Asking others to decide and then resenting it</li><li>Avoiding leadership to avoid culpability later</li><li>Unconsciously inviting others to dominate them</li><li>Blaming others for being the “bully”</li><li>Desire to be the “nice” or “good” one</li><li>An insatiable need to be liked, accepted, included</li></ul><h3 id="results-in-a-conflict-averse-climate">Results in a Conflict Averse Climate </h3><p>These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they put extreme energy into taking care of or helping others with an unstated expectation that there will be a reward in return. For example, they take care of someone with the expectation that the other person will take the responsibility of making decisions for them. However, they may not tell the other person this expectation. There is an unconscious …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

A few weeks ago I've shown you how simple Clojure's
<a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() is, even compared to Keras. I've also mentioned
that it's superfast. Here's how fast it is on the GPU!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc0a2ae3">
<h2 id="orgc0a2ae3">TL;DR Much faster than Keras+TensorFlow on the GPU, too!</h2>
<div id="text-orgc0a2ae3">
<p>
In the <a href="https://dragan.rocks/articles/20/Going-faster-than-TensorFlow-with-Clojure">previous article</a>, we have only compared the libraries on the CPU.
Deep Diamond was considerably faster: 368 seconds vs 509 seconds. Most readers were intrigued,
but, being skeptical as they should be, they complained that CPU performance doesn't matter
anyway, since everybody uses GPU for training convolution networks;
let's do the GPU comparison then.
</p>

<p>
Both Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow, use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">Nvidia's cuDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and any difference is due to the higher-level implementation.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>21</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>35</b> seconds.
The gap even increased in favor of Deep Diamond! Now the ratio is <b>1.67</b>, in place of 1.38 on the CPU.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>You may or may not have heard about the release of the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk">terraform cdk</a> (short for cloud development kit). It’s HashiCorps answer to the aws cdk. In the words of the projects readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for Terraform allows developers to use familiar programming languages to define cloud infrastructure and provision it through HashiCorp Terraform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try this out shall we?</p>
<p>To get the full developer experience, make sure you have <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support">typescript support installed for your IDE</a></p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h3>Generating the boilerplate</h3>
<p>Let’s open our terminal and install install cdktf-cli:</p>

<p>Next we’ll initialize the project</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> hello-cdktf
<span>cd</span> hello-cdktf
cdktf init --template<span>=</span><span>"typescript"</span> --local</code></pre></div>
<p>Answer the two configuration questions and the project boilerplate will be generated.</p>
<p>Now we should see a <code>main.ts</code> file with the following contents in our folder:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Construct <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'constructs'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> App<span>,</span> TerraformStack <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'cdktf'</span><span>;</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MyStack</span> <span>extends</span> <span>TerraformStack</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>scope<span>:</span> Construct<span>,</span> name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span>scope<span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> app <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>new</span> <span>MyStack</span><span>(</span>app<span>,</span> <span>'hello-cdktf2'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
app<span>.</span><span>synth</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Adding a provider package and importing modules from it</h3>
<p>After generation finishes you’ll see a message in the console listing instructions of what to do next. To add the prebuilt aws provider (which also gives us all the modules and types that we might want).</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> -a @cdktf/provider-aws</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you can import modules from <code>@cdktf/provider-aws</code> such as <code>AwsProvider</code> and others. We’ll go for the <code>AwsProvider</code>, <code>LambdaFunction</code> and <code>IamRole</code>. Add this at the top of your file:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> AwsProvider<span>,</span> LambdaFunction<span>,</span> IamRole <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@cdktf/provider-aws'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then create an AwsProvider in your stack:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>AwsProvider</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>'aws'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  region<span>:</span> <span>'eu-west-2'</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Adding a lambda function to our stack</h3>
<p>To create a lambda we need to define an IAM role at first. Boring, but made easier by autocomplete of cours. Anyway here’s the default policy:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> roleForLambda <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>IamRole</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>'iam-role-for-lambda'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'iam-role-for-lambda'</span><span>,</span>
  assumeRolePolicy<span>:</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    <span>"Version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span>
        <span>"Action"</span><span>:</span> <span>"sts:AssumeRole"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>"Service"</span><span>:</span> <span>"lambda.amazonaws.com"</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can add a lambda function to the stack like this:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>LambdaFunction</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>'hello-world'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  filename<span>:</span> process<span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'hello-world.zip'</span>
  functionName<span>:</span> <span>'hello-world'</span><span>,</span>
  handler<span>:</span> <span>'index.handler'</span><span>,</span>
  runtime<span>:</span> <span>'nodejs12.x'</span><span>,</span>
  role<span>:</span> roleForLambda<span>.</span>arn<span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will need to zip your lambda function - which is usually a separate step before running terraform. For example sake, let’s say you have a file in your project named <code>hello-world.js</code>:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span> hello<span>:</span> world <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then zip your lambda <code>zip -r lambda.zip hello-world.js</code></p>
<h3>Deploying your stack</h3>
<p>Before you deploy don’t forget need to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html">have your aws credentials in your path</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have everything ready you can deploy your stack with <code>cdktf deploy</code>. This command will display an execution plan and ask you if you want to deploy. Press the <code>Y</code> and <code>Enter</code> key to deploy.</p>
<p>Any errors at this stage should be farely self-explanatory. If they don’t make sense, google the error message - other people have likely run into the same problem.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you’re a terraform user and you’ve used the <code>lambda_function</code> module before, you’ll notice that the configuration is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when you run <code>cdktf synth</code> cdktf compiles your javascript/typescript modules into terraforms alternative <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax-json.html"><code>JSON</code> configuration syntax</a>.</p>
<p>This is an extremely powerful feature of terraform’s design since it can be a compile target not just for javascript and typescript, but any kind of language. The open source community could add it’s own language compilers.</p>
<p>Why not write one in rust? 😅</p></section></div>]]>

<p>Croteam released the <a href="https://github.com/Croteam-official/Serious-Engine">Serious Engine 1 source code</a> under GNU GPL v2 in 2016, and I've wanted to check it out for quite a while now. My observations here are based on reading and debugging this particular codebase and not reverse-engineering the classics released on GOG and Steam. Keep in mind that comments in code snippets have been replaced to provide more context. Also, some of my conclusions here may be wrong, so you can send me a message over at <a href="https://twitter.com/Sklopec">@Sklopec</a> if you feel like something needs correction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>This isn't an in-depth technical analysis, but an overview with more focus on the concepts rather than the implementation. I have skipped over a lot of things for the sake of simplicity. Also, the following sections assume you have at least a vague idea of how Serious Sam looks and plays.</em></p>

<ul>

</ul>



<hr>

<p><strong>Serious Sam</strong> was built from the ground up as a multiplayer game. In a way, it's multiplayer even when you're playing the singleplayer campaign. While this idea may seem unusual at first, it's really just a clever way of abstraction. Let's explore how it works.</p>

<p>Serious Engine supports:</p>

<ul>
<li>singleplayer - offline campaign</li>
<li>multiplayer - online, LAN or local co-op and various game modes
<ul>
<li>supports multiple players on the same client via split-screen!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>demo recording and playback</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at the demo functionality first. Serious Engine allows recording and reproduction of gameplay clips or <em>demos</em>. Both multiplayer and singleplayer game sessions can be recorded. In order to record a game, the most naive solution would be to persist the game state of every tick into a file.</p>

<p>However, such an approach has a problem - demo files would be ridiculously large.</p>

<p>Instead, Serious Engine records the entire game state at the beginning of the recording, and then, each tick, records something called <strong>game stream blocks</strong>. For now, think of these as messages which describe events in the game. They can be of these types:</p>

<pre><code>MSG_SEQ_ALLACTIONS,      // Player actions. See below.
MSG_SEQ_ADDPLAYER,       // Add a new player to the game.
MSG_SEQ_REMPLAYER,       // Remove a player from the game.
MSG_SEQ_PAUSE,           // Pause or unpause the game.
MSG_SEQ_CHARACTERCHANGE, // Change an aspect of player's character.
</code></pre>

<p>It's not important that you understand these context of these message types right now - we'll get to that later. For now, let's focus on message type <code>MSG_SEQ_ALLACTIONS</code>, because this is key to understanding how the whole thing works. This particular message type is processed in <code>CSessionState::ProcessGameTick</code>:</p>

<pre><code>FOREACHINSTATICARRAY(ses_apltPlayers, CPlayerTarget, itplt) {
    if (itplt-&gt;IsActive()) {
        // Extract action from message passed as parameter.
        CPlayerAction paAction;
        nmMessage&gt;&gt;paAction;

        // Apply the action to the CPlayerTarget.
        itplt-&gt;ApplyActionPacket(paAction);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The engine deserializes several <code>CPlayerAction</code> objects from the message, one for each active player (since multiplayer games can be recorded as well), and applies these packets. Let's take a look at the <code>CPlayerAction</code> class to see what these packets actually are.</p>

<pre><code>class ENGINE_API CPlayerAction {
public:
    FLOAT3D pa_vTranslation;
    ANGLE3D pa_aRotation;
    ANGLE3D pa_aViewRotation;
    ULONG   pa_ulButtons;
    __int64 pa_llCreated;

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>CPlayerAction</code> describes the player's state:</p>

<ul>
<li>player character velocity in world-space (<code>pa_vTranslation</code>)</li>
<li>player character rotation in world-space (<code>pa_aRotation</code>)</li>
<li>player view rotation in world-space (<code>pa_aViewRotation</code>)</li>
<li>buttons currently held down (<code>pa_ulButtons</code>, application defined, independent of control mapping scheme)</li>
<li>timestamp in milliseconds (<code>pa_llCreated</code>, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter">TSC</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These messages are generated by the Engine each tick during gameplay as the player interacts with the game (presses buttons, moves the mouse and/or thumbsticks). The messages are continuously serialized during recording and written into the demo file.</p>

<p>So how does reproduction work? The idea is simple - the Engine assumes everything in the game is completely predictable, and the players are the only ones with the power to change things. So in order to record the demo, the Engine only needs to record the entire game state once, and then only record the actions players perform each tick. In order to perform playback, the Engine deserializes the initial game state from the demo file, and then deserializes and applies player actions each tick as if the player was playing the game.</p>

<p>Neat, isn't it?</p>

<p>There's a caveat, though - <strong>this means the Engine's game model has to be completely deterministic.</strong> And it is. You can see an example of this if you peek into the <code>CEntity</code> implementation:</p>

<pre><code>ULONG CEntity::IRnd(void)
{
    return ((_pNetwork-&gt;ga_sesSessionState.Rnd()&gt;&gt;(31-16))&amp;0xFFFF);
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>CSessionState::Rnd()</code> is a pseudo-random number generator whose seed is part of the game state and is therefore initialized during game state deserialization:</p>

<pre><code>void CSessionState::Read_t(CTStream *pstr)  // throw char *
{
    // ...
    (*pstr)&gt;&gt;ses_ulRandomSeed;
    // ...
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sure the Engine is able to reproduce the exact same scenario every time we play the demo. If we would, say, use a truly random number generator for some game logic, or even a pseudo-random generator with differing seed, we would get different results every time - the famous <strong>desynchronization</strong>.</p>

<h2>Floating Point Determinism <a name="floating-point-determinism"></a></h2>

<p>There's also the matter of potential desynchronization due to floating point numbers. However, since Serious Sam on PC was originally released on Windows only, they could get away with using one compiler for everything, thus eliminating any sync issues that would emerge due to differences in C runtime library, like different implementations of trigonometry functions.</p>

<p>Similar issues can also arise due to differences in FPU precision. For example, the renderers are DLLs, and different clients might use different renderers. Renderers call various APIs (OpenGL, DirectX), and function calls in some of them might set FPU precision to different than expected. Serious Engine seems to have that covered as well. You can see precision guards like these, sprinkled around:</p>

<pre><code>CSetFPUPrecision FPUPrecision(FPT_24BIT);
</code></pre>

<p>Upon this object's construction, <code>_control87</code> function (MSVC specific) is used to cache the current FPU precision, then apply the new one. Once the object goes out of scope, the cached FPU precision is restored.</p>

<p>In theory, problems like these could also occur due to rounding control, but I haven't seen it explicitly set anywhere in the engine. There's this assert though, but this is just a query.</p>

<pre><code>ASSERT((_controlfp(0, 0)&amp;_MCW_RC)==_RC_NEAR);
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe it just wasn't that big of a deal - perhaps the rounding differences would be small enough not to accumulate significantly over the relatively short time that a session lasts, and thus, not produce any noticeable desynchronization.</p>

<h2>Tick vs. Frame <a name="tick-vs-frame"></a></h2>

<p>Notice how I use the word <strong>tick</strong> instead of <strong>frame</strong>. This is because the game logic tickrate is decoupled from the rendering framerate. Rendering framerate varies depending on the hardware and settings, but seems to be capped at <strong>500 frames per second</strong> internally. However, the game logic rate is constant and limited to <strong>20 ticks per second</strong>. But why do we see smooth movement and animation?</p>

<p><strong>Interpolation</strong>. Serious Engine interpolates between the current and the previous game tick based on time passed between. Try opening the in-game console (<code>~</code> key) and typing this to see how the game looks and feels without interpolation:</p>

<pre><code>/net_bLerping=0
</code></pre>

<p>It's kind of like playing a modern console exclusive. So how does Serious Engine smooth this out?</p>

<p>Animations and movement are interpolated with simple linear interpolation (lerp):</p>

<pre><code>interpolated_state = old_state + (new_state - old_state) * factor;
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>factor</code> is a floating point value in range <code>[0.0f, 1.0f]</code>. The factor in a particular moment in time is calculated as follows (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>// Time is in seconds.
float real_delta = time_since_session_started;
float tick_delta = time_of_last_tick - time_of_first_tick;

// 20 FPS logic framerate.
static constexpr float tick_quantum = 1 / 20.0f;

float factor2 = 1.0f - (tick_delta - real_delta) / tick_quantum;
</code></pre>

<p>Or illustrated, if don't mind my terrible handwriting...</p>

<p><img src="https://staniks.github.io/img/articles/serious-engine/frametick.png" alt="Ticks explained" title="Ticks explained"></p>

<p>You can also see the implementation in <code>CSessionState::SetLerpFactor</code>. You will notice there are two interpolation (<code>Lerp</code>) factors - one is for predicted movement, and one is for non-predicted. For now, don't worry about predicted movement - we'll get to prediction and explain how it works later.</p>

<p>Now that we've covered the basic concept of the demo recording and reproduction, think about this: instead of recording the course of the game into a file to be reproduced later, we could send it over the network to be reproduced in real time as we play the game with another person. That is the basic idea of Serious Engine multiplayer.</p>



<hr>

<p>Unfortunately, the internet is a much more complicated environment than a file on your disk drive. Serious Sam is a fast paced game, and making things work fast over the internet is somewhat tricky, especially if you consider the fact that Serious Sam came out in the early 2000s, when a noticeable amount of people were still using 56k modems.</p>

<p>As you may have already guessed, Serious Sam employs a multiplayer model in which every player runs their own simulation and merely receives instructions on what the players have done, much like the demo system. If you glance at the code, you might see function names like <code>CNetworkLibrary::StartPeerToPeer_t</code>, but this is somewhat misleading - Serious Sam's networking isn't really peer to peer, even though the logic is processed akin to the old lockstep multiplayer games.</p>

<p>Serious Engine's networking model is actually client-server.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that, for a single multiplayer session, there is a single server, and the clients connect to it. The server receives messages from clients, …</p></section></div>

<a href="https://containo.us/traefik/">Traefik</a> is <del>The Cloud Native Edge Router</del> yet another reverse proxy and load balancer. Omitting all the cloud-native buzzwords, what really makes Traefik different from Nginx, HAProxy, and alike is the automatic and dynamic configurability it provides out of the box. And the most prominent part of it is probably its ability to do automatic service discovery. If you put Traefik in front of <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/providers/overview/#supported-providers">Docker, Kubernetes, or even an old-fashioned VM/bare-metal deployment</a> and show it how to fetch the information about the running services, it'll automagically expose them to the outside world. If you follow some conventions of course...<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="weighted-load-balancing">Weighted load balancing</h2>
<p>If you have a fairly small deployment, up to a single-digit number of machines, and for some reason, you cannot jump into the clouds and enjoy the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">serverless containers</a>, combining Docker and Traefik is an ideal choice. For deployments of such scale using a full-fledged orchestrator like Kubernetes or Mesos would be overkill due to the resource requirements and the inherent complexity of the orchestrator itself. But the fact that we are going to stick with the poor man's solution doesn't mean that we don't want to benefit from the modern development best practices.</p>
<p>So, for simplicity, imagine, we have just one machine. There is a Docker daemon running on it and a <code>traefik</code> container listening on the host's port <em>80</em> (or <em>443</em>, whatever). And we want to deploy our service on that machine. However, we would also like to release the new versions safely by applying the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html">canary deployment technique</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/traefik-canary-deployments-with-weighted-load-balancing/05-traefik-canary-single-box.png" width="80%">
</p>

<p>Thus, we need to get Traefik to do the weighted load balancing between the Docker containers of the same service. If we could solve the load balancing problem on a single machine, we would simply scale it out to the rest of the fleet:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/traefik-canary-deployments-with-weighted-load-balancing/07-traefik-canary-many-boxes.png" width="80%">
</p>

<p>If every instance of the <em>traefik</em> proxy gets more or less the same number of requests we could achieve the desired share of the canary requests across the whole fleet.</p>
<h2 id="not-invented-here-traefik-v1-vs-traefik-v2">Not invented here (Traefik v1 vs Traefik v2)</h2>
<p>All that proxy kind of software architecturally looks more or less the same. There is always:</p>
<ul>
<li>a front end component dealing with the incoming requests from clients;</li>
<li>an intermediary pipeline dealing with requests transformations;</li>
<li>a back end component dealing with the outgoing requests to upstream services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every service proxy calls these parts in its own way (<em>entrypoint</em>, <em>server</em>, <em>virtual host</em>, <em>listener</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>middleware</em>, <em>upstream</em>, <em>endpoint</em>, etc) but Traefik folks went even further...</p>
<p>Historically, Traefik was using <code>entrypoint -&gt; frontend -&gt; backend</code> model:</p>


<p>However, <a href="https://containo.us/blog/back-to-traefik-2-0-2f9aa17be305/">in 2019 the new Traefik major version has been announced</a> bringing a breaking configuration change and a refined approach:</p>


<p>So, in Traefik 2 instead of <em>frontends</em> and <em>backends</em>, we now have <em>routers</em> and <em>services</em>. And there is also an explicit layer of <em>middleware</em> components dealing with extra request transformations. Well, makes perfect sense! But if the v1 documentation basically <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/v1.7/basics/">starts from the architectural overview</a> making the further reading much simpler, in the case of v2 you need to dig down to the <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/routing/overview/">Routing</a> or <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/">Middleware</a> concepts to get the first decent diagrams (even though I found all the preceding illustrations very entertaining).</p>
<p>For the newcomers trying to configure Traefik following blog posts on the Internet (well, how doesn't?), beware - as of Q3 2020 most of the articles show the Traefik v1 examples. Config snippets from those articles will simply not work with the Traefik v2 release (often silently). There is a <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/migration/v1-to-v2/">migration page</a> in the official documentation, although IMO it lacks visual representation of the change.</p>
<h2 id="weighted-load-balancing-with-traefik-1">Weighted load balancing with Traefik 1</h2>
<p>Apparently, it <del>is</del> was super simple. First, run the <code>traefik:v1.7</code> container with Docker provider:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d --rm \
  --name traefik-v1.7 \
  -p 9999:80 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  traefik:v1.7 \
    --docker \
    --docker.exposedbydefault=false</code></pre>
<p>And since it's a v1, we'd need to think in terms of <em>frontends</em> and <em>backends</em>. Apparently, every container would become a server of a particular <em>backend</em>. Conveniently, <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/v1.7/configuration/backends/docker/">the weight of the server could be assigned</a> using <code>traefik.weight</code> label:</p>
<pre><code># Run the current app version (weight 40)
docker run -d --rm --name app_normal \
  --label "traefik.enable=true" \
  --label "traefik.backend=app_weighted" \
  --label "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:example.local" \
  --label "traefik.weight=40" \
  nginx:1.19.1

# Run the contender version (weight 10)
docker run -d --rm --name app_canary \
  --label "traefik.enable=true" \
  --label "traefik.backend=app_weighted" \
  --label "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:example.local" \
  --label "traefik.weight=10" \
  nginx:1.19.2</code></pre>
<p>Send some traffic, just to make sure that it works:</p>
<pre><code>for i in {1..100}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -D - -H Host:example.local localhost:9999 | grep Server; done | sort | uniq -c

&gt;  80 Server: nginx/1.19.1
&gt;  20 Server: nginx/1.19.2</code></pre>
<p>Perfect, 20 out of 100 requests have been served by the canary release container. And if we don't need the canary at some point in time, we can simply stop the container:</p>
<pre><code>docker stop app_canary</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you repeat the traffic probe, 100% of the requests will be served by the <code>app_normal</code> container:</p>
<pre><code>for i in {1..100}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -D - -H Host:example.local localhost:9999 | grep Server; done | sort | uniq -c

&gt;  100 Server: nginx/1.19.1</code></pre>
<p>Easy-peasy, right?</p>
<h2 id="weighted-load-balancing-with-traefik-2">Weighted load balancing with Traefik 2</h2>
<p>And that's where things start getting more complicated... After thoroughly studying the v2 docs, I could not find the <code>weight</code> directive anymore. The closest thing I was able to find was the <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/routing/services/#weighted-round-robin-service">Weighted Round Robin Service</a> (WRR):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The WRR is able to load balance the requests between multiple services based on weights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is a couple of limitations with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This strategy is only available to load balance between <strong>services</strong> and not between <strong>servers</strong>.</li>
<li>This strategy can be defined currently with the <strong>File</strong> or <strong>IngressRoute</strong> providers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I.e. no Docker provider support and no direct weight assignment to servers (i.e. containers).</p>
<p>Well, let's try to be creative. Excluding IngressRoute provider (sounds like a Kubernetes thing), we basically have only one option to define WRR service - the File provider. What if we combine it with the Docker provider?</p>
<p>First, define a WRR service in the file:</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; "EOF" &gt; file_provider.yml
---
http:
  routers:
    router0:
      service: app_weighted
      rule: "Host(`example.local`)"
  services:
    app_weighted:
      weighted:
        services:
          - name: app_normal@docker  # I'm not defined yet
            weight: 40
          - name: app_canary@docker  # Neither do it
            weight: 10
EOF</code></pre>
<p>Notice, that we haven't defined any <strong>servers</strong> (i.e. containers) there. Instead, we defined an <code>app_weighted</code> service in terms of its sub-services - <code>app_normal</code> and <code>app_canary</code> (there is <code>@docker</code> suffix to say that these services are expected to be defined by the Docker provider).</p>
<p>Let's start the <code>traefik:v2.2</code> container with the Docker and file providers:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d --rm --name traefik-v2.2 \
  -p 9999:80 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v `pwd`:/etc/traefik_providers \
  traefik:v2.2 \
    --providers.docker \
    --providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false \
    --providers.file.filename=/etc/traefik_providers/file_provider.yml</code></pre>
<p>Now, it's time to launch the application containers. Since it's the v2, we need to think in terms of <em>routers</em> and <em>services</em> while <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/reference/dynamic-configuration/docker/">configuring</a> the container labels:</p>
<pre><code># Run the current app version (weight 40)
docker run -d --rm --name app_normal_01 \
  --label "traefik.enable=true" \
  --label "traefik.http.services.app_normal.loadbalancer.server.port=80" \
  --label "traefik.http.routers.app_normal_01.entrypoints=traefik" \
  nginx:1.19.1

# Run the contender version (weight 10)
docker run -d --rm --name app_canary_01 \
  --label "traefik.enable=true" \
  --label "traefik.http.services.app_canary.loadbalancer.server.port=80" \
  --label "traefik.http.routers.app_canary_01.entrypoints=traefik" \
  nginx:1.19.2</code></pre>
<p>Let's try to understand the reasoning behind these labels. In general, launching a container means creating a single-server service. If we don't ask otherwise, Traefik 2 implicitly creates such a service using the container's name (replacing <code>_</code> with <code>-</code> for some reasons). On top of that, it adds a routing rule <code>Host(`&lt;container-name-goes-here&gt;`)</code>.</p>
<p>But in our case, we don't want to have arbitrary services for our containers. Instead, we know exactly the name of the service for the normal app containers (<code>app_normal</code>) and the name of the service for the canary app containers (<code>app_canary</code>). Thus, we need to somehow bind the containers (i.e. servers) to the desired services. And a somewhat <em>hacky</em> way of doing that is by using <code>traefik.http.services.&lt;service-name&gt;.loadbalancer.server.port=80</code> label. We don't really need to specify the port here because Traefik would figure it out by itself. But doing so allows us to introduce the <code>app_normal</code> and <code>app_canary</code> services and put the containers in there.</p>
<p>For the second label, remember the default routing rule <code>Host(`&lt;container-name-goes-here&gt;`)</code> that gets assigned to every container automatically? To avoid these containers being accidentally exposed to the outside world, we use the label <code>traefik.http.routers.&lt;stub&gt;.entrypoints=traefik</code>. It's just another hack, binding the containers to the internal <code>entrypoint</code> called <code>traefik</code>. This entrypoint is used for the Traefik's admin API and dashboard and should not be exposed publicly in production environments.</p>
<p>Finally, let's send some traffic, just to make sure that it works:</p>
<pre><code>for i in {1..100}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -D - -H Host:example.local localhost:9999 | grep Server; done | sort | uniq -c

&gt;  80 Server: nginx/1.19.1
&gt;  20 Server: nginx/1.19.2</code></pre>
<p>Great! But what if we need to stop the canary containers? If we just do it right away, the <code>app_weighted@file</code> service will stop functioning due to the disappeared <code>app_canary</code> service. Likely, even the File is <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/reference/dynamic-configuration/file/">a dynamic …</a></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Contract testing helps ensure the compatibility of microservices and decouples the development and deployment processes of software teams. In this article, you'll learn more about contract testing and how to use Pact to verify and ensure your Node.js microservices' API compatibility.</p><div><div><h2 id="ensuring-api-compatibility-in-distributed-systems"><span>Ensuring API compatibility in distributed systems</span></h2><p>The use of microservices is growing in popularity for good reasons. They allow software teams to develop, deploy, and scale software independently to deliver business value faster. Large software projects are broken down into smaller modules, which are easier to understand and maintain. While the internal functionality of each microservice is getting simpler, the complexity in a microservice architecture is moved to the communication layer and often requires the integration between services.</p><p>However, in microservice architectures, you often find service to service communication, leading to increased complexity in the communication layer and the need to integrate other services.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/amazon-netflix-services.png">
<em>Figure 1: Distributed systems at Amazon and Netflix</em></p><p>Traditional <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#testing-integration-introduction">integration testing</a> has proven to be a suitable tool to verify the compatibility of components in a distributed system. However, as the number of services increases, maintaining a fully integrated test environment can become complex, slow, and difficult to coordinate. The increased use of resources can also become a problem, for example when starting up a full system locally or during continuous integration (CI). Contract testing aims to address these challenges – let's find out how.</p><h2 id="what-is-contract-testing"><span>What is contract testing?</span></h2><p>Contract testing is a technique for checking and ensuring the interoperability of software applications in isolation and enables teams to deploy their microservices independently of one another. Contracts are used to define the interactions between API consumers and providers. The two participants must meet the requirements set out in these contracts, such as endpoint definitions and request and response structures.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/contract-testing.png">
<em>Figure 2: A contract that defines a HTTP GET interaction</em></p><h2 id="what-is-consumer-driven-contract-testing"><span>What is consumer-driven contract testing?</span></h2><p>Consumer-driven contract testing allows developers to start implementing the consumer (API client) even though the provider (API) isn’t yet available. For this, the consumer writes the contract for the API provider using <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">test doubles</a> (also known as API mocks or stubs). Thanks to these test doubles, teams can decouple the implementation and testing of consumer and provider applications so that they’re not dependent on each other. Once the provider has verified its structure against the contract requirements, new consumer versions can be deployed with confidence knowing that the systems are compatible.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/consumer-driven-contract-testing.png">
<em>Figure 3: Consumer-driven contract testing</em></p><h2 id="what-is-pact"><span>What is Pact?</span></h2><p><a href="https://pact.io/">Pact</a> is a code-first consumer-driven contract testing tool. Consumer contracts, also called Pacts, are defined in code and are generated after successfully running the consumer tests. The Pact files use JSON format and are used to spin up a Pact Mock Service to test and verify the compatibility of the provider API.</p><p>The tool also offers the so-called Pact Mock Provider, with which developers can implement and test the consumer using a mocked API. This, in turn, accelerates development time, as teams don't have to wait for the provider to be available.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/pact-overview.png">
<em>Figure 4: Pact overview</em></p><p>Pact was initially designed for request/response interactions and supports both REST and GraphQL APIs, as well as many different <a href="https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides">programming languages</a>. For Providers written in languages that don't have native Pact support, you can still use the generic <a href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-provider-verifier">Pact Provider Verification tool</a>.</p><h2 id="try-out-pact"><span>Try out Pact</span></h2><p>Why don't we test things ourselves and see how consumer-driven contract testing with Pact actually works? For this, we use <a href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js">Pact JS</a>, the Pact library for JavaScript, and Node.js. We've already created a <a href="https://github.com/coder-society/contract-testing-nodejs-pact">sample repository</a> containing an order API, which returns a list of orders. Let’s start by cloning the project and installing the dependencies:</p><div><div><div><div><pre><p><span>$ </span><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/coder-society/contract-testing-nodejs-pact.git</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>cd</span><span> contract-testing-nodejs-pact</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>npm</span><span> </span><span>install</span></p></pre></div></div></div></div><h2 id="writing-a-pact-consumer-test"><span>Writing a Pact consumer test</span></h2><p>We created a file called <code>consumer.spec.js</code> to define the expectedinteractions between our order API client (consumer) and the order API itself (provider). We expect the following interactions:</p><ul><li>HTTP GET request against path <code>/orders</code> which returns a list of orders.</li><li>The order response matches a defined structure.

		<p>In 1998, I had some extra time while others were reading for final exams of the senior high school, and got into digital signal processing. I wrote as I learned, and here is the result. It is not entirely accurate in places but may serve as a nice tutorial into the world of audio DSP. Previously this document was called Yehar's digital sound processing tutorial for the braindead, but I have kinda grown out of  my scene identity over the years. Enjoy the ASCII art!</p>

<h2><a name="dspstuff_1">Foreword</a></h2>
<p>This is written for the audio digital signal processing enthusiasts (as the title suggests ;) and others who need practical information on the subject. If you don't have this as a "linear reading experience" and encounter difficulties, check if there's something to help you out in the previous chapters.</p>
<p>In filter frequency response plots, linear frequency and magnitude scales are used. Page changes are designed for 60+ lines/page printers.</p>
<p>Chapter "Shuffling IIR equations" is written by my big brother Kalle. And, thanks to Timo Tossavainen for sharing his DSP knowledge!</p>

<h2><a name="dspstuff_2">About sampled sound</a></h2>
<p>Note that "sample" can mean (1) a sampled sound or (2) a samplepoint!</p>
<p>Sampled sound data is a pile of samples, amplitude values taken from the actual sound wave. Sampling rate is the frequency of the "shots". For example, if the frequency is 44100, 44100 samples have been taken in one second.</p>
<p>Here's an example of sampling:</p>
<pre>                                           _0---0_
                                         _/       --0__
        0_                __0---0__    _0              -0---0___
          \_          _-0-         -0--                         0-__
        +---0==-+--=0---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---0==-+---+
               -0--                                                    -0_
                                                                          --0
                                            &lt;---&gt;
                                        1/Samplerate</pre>
<p>The original sound is the curve, and "0"s are the sampled points. The horizontal straight line is the zero level.</p>
<p>A sampled sound can only represent frequencies up to half the samplerate. This is called the Nyquist frequency. An easy proof: You need to have stored at least two samplepoints per wave cycle, the top and the bottom of the wave to be able to reconstruct it later on:</p>
<pre>        0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\     /0\
          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        +-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+-|-+
          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0/     \0</pre>
<p>If you try to include above Nyquist frequencies in your sampled sound, all you get is extra distortion as they appear as lower frequencies.</p>
<h2><a name="dspstuff_3">Adding two sine waves together</a></h2>
<p>A Sound consists of frequency components. They all look exactly like sine waves, but they have different frequencies, phases and amplitudes. Let's look at a single frequency:</p>
<pre>                | __        __        __        __      |
                |/  \      /  \      /  \      /  \     |
                /----\----/----\----/----\----/----\----/
                |     \__/      \__/      \__/      \__/|
                |                                       |</pre>
<p>Now, we take the same frequency from another sound and notice that it has the same amplitude, but the opposite (rotated 180 degrees) phase.</p>
<pre>                |      __        __        __        __ |

<p>Merging two signals is done simply by adding them together. If we do the same with these two sine waves, the result will be:</p>
<pre>                |                                       |
                |                                       |
                +=======================================+
                |                                       |
                |                                       |</pre>
<p>It gets silent. If we think of other cases, where the phase difference is less than 180 degrees, we get sine waves that all have different amplitudes and phases, but the same frequency.</p>
<p>Here's the way to calculate the phase and the amplitude of the resulting sinewave... Convert the amplitude and phase into one complex number, where angle is the phase, and absolute value the amplitude.</p>
<pre>        amplitude*e^(i*phase) = amplitude*cos(phase)+i*amplitude*sin(phase)</pre>
<p>If you do this to both of the sinewaves, you can add them together as complex numbers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>        (Wave A) amplitude 1, phase 0, (Wave B) amplitude 1, phase 90 degrees

                   _---|---_         _---0---_         _---|---_ 0
                  /    |    \       /    |    \       /    |    \
                 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
                -|-----+-----0- + -|-----+-----|- = -|-----+-----|-
                 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
                  \_   |   _/       \_   |   _/       \_   |   _/
                    ---|---           ---|---           ---|---</pre>
<p>As you see, the phase of the new sine wave is 45 degrees and the amplitude sqrt(1^2+1^2) = sqrt(2) = about 1.4</p>
<p>It is very important that you understand this, because in many cases, it is more practical to present the amplitude and the phase of a frequency as a complex number.</p>
<p>When adding two sampled sounds together, you may actually wipe out some frequencies, those that had opposite phases and equal amplitudes. The average amplitude of the resulting sound is (for independent originals) sqrt(a^2+b^2) where a and b are the amplitudes of the original signals.</p>
<h2><a name="dspstuff_4">What's a filter?</a></h2>
<p>The main use of a filter is to scale the amplitudes of the frequency components in a sound. For example, a "lowpass filter" mutes all frequency components above the "cutoff frequency", in other words, multiplies the amplitudes by 0. It lets through all the frequencies below the cutoff frequency unattenuated.</p>
<h3>Magnitude</h3>
<p>If you investigate the behaviour of a lowpass filter by driving various sinewaves of different frequencies through it, and measure the amplifications, you get the "magnitude frequency response". Here's a plot of the magnitude frequency response curve of a lowpass filter:</p>
<pre>                1-+----------------------_                              |
                  |                       \                             |
                  |       Audible          |          Inaudible         |
                  |                        |                            |
                  |                        |                            |
                  |                         \_                          |
                0-+---------------------------===========================
                  |                        |                            |
                 0Hz                Cutoff frequency                   max</pre>
<p>Frequency is on the "-" axis and amplification on the "|" axis. As you see, the amplification (= scaling) of the frequencies below the cutoff frequency is 1. So, their amplitudes are not affected in any way. But the amplitudes of frequencies above the cutoff frequency get multiplied by zero so they vanish.</p>
<p>Filters never add any new frequency components to the sound. They can only scale the amplitudes of already existing frequencies. For example, if you have a completely quiet sample, you can't get any sound out of it by filtering. Also, if you have a sine wave sample and filter it, the result will still be the same sine wave, only maybe with different amplitude and phase - no other frequencies can appear.</p>
<h3>Phase</h3>
<p>Professionals never get tired of reminding us how important it is not to forget the phase. The frequency components in a sound have their amplitudes and... phases. If we take a sine wave and a cosine wave, we see that they look alike, but they have a phase difference of pi/2, one fourth of a full cycle. Also, when you play them, they sound alike. But, try wearing a headset and play the sinewave on the left channel and the cosine wave on the right channel. Now you hear the difference!</p>
<p>Phase itself doesn't contain important information for us so it's not heard, but the phase difference, of a frequency, between the two ears can be used in estimating the position of the origin of the sound so it's heard.</p>
<p>Filters have a magnitude frequency response, but they also have a phase frequency response. Here's an example curve that could be from a lowpass filter:</p>
<pre>              +pi-+-----------------------------------------------------+
                  |                    ___                              |
                  |      _________-----   \                             |
                0-+======------------------|---------====================
                  |                         \___-----                   |
                  |                                                     |
              -pi-+-----------------------------------------------------+
                  |                        |                            |
                 0Hz                Cutoff frequency                   max</pre>
<p>If you filter a sound, the values from the phase frequency response …</p></div></div>

<p><em>NOTE TO OUR READERS: Journalist Hajo Schumacher, who conducted this interview, and former politician Silvana Koch-Mehrin have known each other for many years. It is on the basis of this mutual trust that Koch-Mehrin responded to the questions that many of our readers found to be impertinent and unsettling. We apologize for not having been clear about their rapport from the very beginning.</em></p>
</section>


<section>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Ms. Koch-Mehrin, you were diagnosed with breast cancer last fall. How are you doing today?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I'm doing well, thank you. I feel healthy. And the prognoses look good; it will likely stay that way.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What physical and psychological effects did your experience leave you with.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> So much has changed that "leave" is the wrong word. Cancer diagnosis, mastectomy, chemo and radiation therapy: It is an existential experience. Very little is like it was before, both physically and psychologically. But it's not worse, just different.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Can you give us an example?</p>
</section>


<section>
<p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> The side effects I experienced from chemo included a runny and bloody nose, my eyes would tear up and I had to constantly clear my throat. Picking up and holding small things became difficult and I experienced a loss of feeling in my fingertips. My hair, eyebrows and eyelashes fell out. "Before," I took those things, and the ability to do things, for granted. Now, I see it as a gift.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Describe the moment when you received your diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I can precisely recall every detail - the vase on the table, the pictures and books on the shelf. I was in the United States for work and was sitting in a friend's office when my doctor called me: cancer. It was a shock because I felt so healthy. I thought it was just my normal annual checkup. Simply uttering the sentence "I have cancer" sounded to me like "I am dying." Still, even after the telephone call, I went to all of the meetings on my schedule. I was like a robot, which is probably a protective mechanism. The doctor's optimism helped me a great deal in getting over the shock. I can only urge all women, even if you're under 50, to please get screened regularly. The stage at which cancer is discovered makes a huge difference.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Is breast cancer more taboo than other varieties of cancer?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> When people learn from somebody that he or she has cancer, they often fall silent. They don't know what to say. And how should they? "You'll be fine" sounds rather desperate and doesn't help the person who is sick. We live in a society that suppresses things: We still ignore illness and death far too often. Because of that, many women remain silent about their breast cancer diagnosis. On the one hand, they do so because they themselves are shaken up, but also because they want to spare others from having to talk about something they simply can't talk about.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You were long seen as a kind of superwoman during your political career with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), combining career and family, with never a hair out of place. You were also fond of playing that role. How has breast cancer changed your feeling of femininity?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Do I hear the male perspective seeping through? Long hair on the head and no hair on the legs? Only a woman if you have breasts? That's nonsense. Take a look at the self-confident women at #goingflat or #onebreastpride. That is a kind of femininity that has nothing to do with conventions. I admire it.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You haven't given an interview for nine years. Are you considering a return to politics?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> If I wanted to return to politics, I certainly wouldn't do so with an interview. My focus is elsewhere entirely. I decided to do this interview to address the silence surrounding cancer and to encourage openness in dealing with serious illnesses.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What did you find particularly helpful during the most difficult times?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I was overwhelmed by the readiness to help, the warmth and the empathy I experienced from family and friends, but also from people whom I hardly knew. My husband and brother shaved their hair off in solidarity. Particularly in moments of despondence, I found it encouraging to hear about how open other women were about their illness.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How great is the danger of remission?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> There isn't a single day when I don't think of cancer. The statistical improbability of remission is certainly reassuring, but every checkup sets me off on an emotional rollercoaster.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did you tell your daughters about your diagnosis?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I was open and honest with them because I wanted them to continue trusting me.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What were the most difficult moments?</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> The first and last chemotherapy sessions were extremely challenging. At the first one, I was so afraid of the side effects that I almost went crazy. By the last session, my mental strength was almost completely used up. I didn't want to do it anymore. I was only able to make it through because I wanted to be strong for my children.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What aspects of the experience did you underestimate?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> That it is a marathon. The treatment goes on for so long, it was almost nine months for me, and it is difficult. And afterwards, it still isn't over. A small example: fingernails take months to grow back normally. And I will be facing regular follow-up appointments for the next 10 years. Plus, some side effects are permanent.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What were the most important lessons you learned?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> For the first time in my life, I really became acquainted with fear. And I had to learn how to deal with it. It's easy for me to say, but it's not easy to do.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Whether you wanted to or not, you fulfilled the classic stereotypes of the blond during your political career. What was it like to be bald and have to wear a wig?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I missed these kinds of questions so much …</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> … it is my pleasure.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Promoting clichés is apparently still part of the standard repertoire of journalism. The virologist Sandra Ciesek is a token woman at the side of Christian Drosten, of course. In the Reykjavik Index, which measures the influence stereotypes have on opinions, Germany doesn't do particularly well. Such questions, which subconsciously strengthen prejudices, contribute to that.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Fine, but you were pretty good at the blond game. You knew very well that in a male-dominated party such as the FDP, you got a lot of attention and that you wouldn't have risen through the ranks so quickly if you had been a man. That is exactly why those who were envious of you abandoned you in 2011 and were happy to see you fall. Did your illness change any of your political positions?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Everyone should have access to first-class health care, irrespective of how much money they have. COVID-19 has made us all realize how vulnerable we are.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You sound like the Social Democratic health expert Karl Lauterbach.</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Take a look at what (Free Democrat) Daniel Bahr proposed back when he was health minister: a legally mandated health-care system rooted in liberalism. It was an intelligent and affordable program that put the focus on the patient.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Do you miss the FDP?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> Some fellow party members became real friends of mine, and I've stayed in touch with a lot of them, even if most are no longer active in politics. I am still convinced that Germany needs a strong liberal party. But I am no longer engaged in party politics. Today, I work with and for women politicians around the world in a strictly non-partisan manner. I am head of Women Political Leaders, a foundation which aims at increasing both the number and the influence of women in politics.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Will you vote for the FDP in the general election next year?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> I will always vote for a liberal party.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Many cancer patients look for reasons why they fell ill, whether it be stress or an unhealthy lifestyle. What explanation did you come up with?</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> It is pretty much impossible to not search for potential causes. There have been huge advances in treatments and cures for breast cancer, but the "why" question has never been adequately answered. The pill is a blessing, because it provides women with self-determination. But I'm not the only one furious at the fact that even 50 years after the pill's introduction, hormones are the focus of contraception, even though the correlation with breast cancer is clear and proven. The focus must be more squarely on women's health.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The Reykjavik Global Forum, which is organized by your foundation every year, recognizes initiatives that are important for women. This year, the prize has been awarded to the pink ribbon, the symbol for the fight against breast cancer. Why?</p><p><strong>Koch-Mehrin:</strong> The pink ribbon, which was introduced exactly 30 years ago, is now a global symbol of the fight against breast cancer. Because women - and now also men – have joined together around the world for the fight, it has been a huge success story. Many women are now able to survive breast cancer because it has been possible to destigmatize the illness, collect donations, finance research and improve treatments. That is what we are recognizing. Prize recipients are the American Nancy Brinker, the first to use the pink ribbon back in the 1990s, and Vigdís Finnbogadóttir of Iceland, a breast cancer survivor and activist in addition to being the first female head of state in the world.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The Berlin-based music journalist Anja Caspary is extremely open about her double mastectomy, not shying away from wearing tight tops in public, which confuses some. What do you think about her confrontational strategy?</p><p><strong>Koch-Me…</strong></p></section></div></section></div></div>

            <h4>One week of NixOS</h4><p>
            Reading time: 4 minutes.
            </p><p>As you may have seen I on Mastodon, I am testing NixOS for over a week now and here is a few comments about how the distro works and what doesn’t work for me.</p>










<p>First, everything is NixOS is declared in a configuration file located at <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> where you declare packages you want to install, services to start, udev rules, ECT, you get it.</p>
<p>This is the first very weird thing as you don’t really install packages with the CLI directly (even if you can), instead you modify the config file and rebuild the system with <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code>.</p>
<p>NixOS is made in such a way that everything aims to be reproducible. An example: if you want to get the exact same setup as I have, you can just take <a href="https://forge.tedomum.net/jae/nixos-configs">my configs repo</a>, clone it on your NixOS installation, run <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> and voilà, you will have the exact same programs as me installed in the same way with the same version (roughly).</p>
<p>In this distro, adding a user is really easy and goes like this:</p>

There, we are installing per-user packages because yes, NixOS supports that, any user can have its own packages that others users can’t access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correction from <em>hvdijk</em> on Hacker News, “<em>Other users can access those packages if they want to. Those packages won’t show up in other users' $PATH, so other users will not be affected by them, but they could see what’s in /nix/store if they wanted to. This matters when you’re thinking of putting private data (such as an encryption key) in a package: it’s vital that you don’t do that on a multi-user system.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configuring NixOS for a daily use is at the end very easy (although I am getting some trouble to get Ledger Live working; which is the biggest problem I’ve had so far).</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about where I got some trouble.
As you may know it, I am a dev and every day I need to compile, test, run and so on.
NixOS gave me some trouble to only run some programs from source such as <a href="https://element.io/">Element Desktop</a> or <a href="https://img.tedomum.net/">TeDomum IMG</a> as the way the system is built, lots of directories are read-only and programs can’t be installed globally through NPM or PIP.
I ended up using Docker to build the apps (even if it took a bit more time).</p>
<p>Needless to say, almost every other project worked.
If you want NodeJS to start a project for instance, you can just do <code>nix-shell -p nodejs</code> and here you go, a shell with nodejs installed, ready to do what you want.</p>
<p>At the end, NixOS brings very interesting concepts such as a really great reproducibility but new users can feel lost as its way to work is really different from conventional Linux distributions.
I’ll give NixOS more time and write a follow-up in some time to see how everything went.</p>
<p>If you want to give it a shot, the <a href="https://nixos.org/">official NixOS website awaits you</a>!</p>
<p>That’s all for today,
I’ll see you next time!

<h2>Going down the time machine rabbit hole…</h2>



<p>I love the fact that MacOS comes with TimeMachine built-in, and I also really appreciate its simplicity. It makes backups easy and accessible even for non-technical people. It gets messy though if you also want to have real offsite backups however.</p>



<p>TimeMachine works great with a USB external HD, but things get tricky over the network.</p>



<p>I own a small Synology NAS, and I managed to mount a TimeMachine volume and get it to backup to that volume. The problem started when the volume size started to grow. I could set a quota on the volume, but for some strange reason, when the quota is reached, TimeMachine just started failing without a clear reason. There’s no way to tell TimeMachine to only keep X versions, or keep disk storage below a certain threshold. It’s <em>supposed</em> to prune backups automatically, but seems to fail with my network volume.</p>



<h2>tmutil to the rescue</h2>



<p>After a bit of digging, I discovered a useful command-line utility that helps managing TimeMachine. <code>tmutil</code> lets you list your backups and also delete specific backups. I could manually easily prune the oldest backup of TimeMachine using <code>tmutil listbackups | head -1 | xargs -I {} sudo tmutil delete "{}"</code>.</p>



<p>How difficult could it be to automate this script so it runs regularly and keeps X copies?</p>



<h2>The script</h2>



<p>The script itself was pretty simple. Please don’t bash my bash skills, but I hope the code is clear and seems to do the job</p>


<pre title="">#!/bin/bash

# keeps backups for up to 7 days
KEEP=7

function timestamp() {
    date -jf '%F-%H%M%S' "$1" '+%s'
}

LAST_BACKUP=$(/usr/bin/tmutil listbackups | /usr/bin/tail -n1)
LAST_BACKUP_DATE=$(basename "$LAST_BACKUP")
LAST_TIMESTAMP=$(timestamp $LAST_BACKUP_DATE)

OLDEST_BACKUP=$(/usr/bin/tmutil listbackups | /usr/bin/head -n1)
OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE=$(basename "$OLDEST_BACKUP")
OLDEST_TIMESTAMP=$(timestamp $OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE)

DIFF=$(( ($LAST_TIMESTAMP - $OLDEST_TIMESTAMP) / (24*3600) ))

while [[ $DIFF &gt; $KEEP ]]; do
    echo "cleaning"
    sudo tmutil delete "$OLDEST_BACKUP"
    OLDEST_BACKUP=$(/usr/bin/tmutil listbackups | /usr/bin/head -n1)    
    OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE=$(basename "$OLDEST_BACKUP")
    OLDEST_TIMESTAMP=$(timestamp $OLDEST_BACKUP_DATE)
    DIFF=$(( ($LAST_TIMESTAMP - $OLDEST_TIMESTAMP) / (24*3600) ))
done
</pre>


<p>Easy-peasy, right? There were two problems left to solve:</p>



<ol><li>run this script on schedule, let’s say once a day or once a week</li><li>make sure we can run this as root, so we don’t need to use <code>sudo</code> (or avoid the password prompt if we do run sudo)</li></ol>



<h2>How difficult can it be?</h2>



<p>Running scheduled jobs on MacOS is quite a bit different from Linux. You could still somehow use a cron job, but it’s not recommended, might be deprecated, and generally not the “right way” to do things. You are supposed to create a <code>launchd</code> script… Ok, so without digging too deep, here’s a simple launchd file for running a command every 24 hours. You need to place this file under <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents/</code> and give it a name like <code>org.whatever.script-name.plist</code></p>


<pre title="">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;!-- The label should be the same as the filename without the extension --&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;org.whatever.script-name&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;!-- Specify how to run your program here --&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/path/to/code/timemachine-cleanup.sh&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;!-- Run every 24 hours --&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;integer&gt;86400&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;!-- seconds --&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</pre>


<p>Then you would need to run this command, so the launchd script gets scheduled</p>



<p><code>launchctl load org.whatever.script-name.plist</code></p>



<p>note: if you need to stop your script from running, you can use the same command, but with <code>unload</code> instead to unload it.</p>



<h2>First problem: Run as root</h2>



<p>The first problem is that this job now runs as your own user id. This is fixable if you move the file to the global /Library/LaunchAgents, make the owner of the file root and use sudo to load it.  It runs as root, but tmutil now fails. Why? because some tools/operations like tmutil require something called Full Disk Access (FDA). </p>



<h2>Second problem: Full Disk Access</h2>



<p>Here’s an interesting post explaining <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/02/15/why-privileged-commands-may-never-be-allowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why some privileged commands are not allowed on MacOS</a>, and a few <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/338213/how-to-run-a-launchagent-that-runs-a-script-which-causes-failures-because-of-sys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems/workarounds being suggested </a>on StackOverflow’s Ask Different.</p>



<p>You can get those commands to run from your terminal, if you add your terminal to the list of allowed apps with Full Disk Access</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="853" height="758" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10.png 853w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10-300x267.png 300w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/CleanShot-2020-11-08-at-10.15.10-768x682.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure>



<p>The problem however, is that for some strange reason, you cannot simply add your script to the list. Or you could add it, but it will still be blocked. I have no clue why.</p>



<h2>Workaround: wrap your script as an app</h2>



<p>You could use Automator.app or Script Editor to do that. You can then add this wrapper app to give it Full Disk Access permissions. That works, but then there’s no way to make it run as root. So we’re back to the first problem again… :-/</p>



<h2>Workaround #2: sudoers with NOPASSWD</h2>



<p>So we won’t run it as root, but use sudo. Then we’re prompted for a password, which we tried to avoid for a scheduled job.</p>



<p>We can however add any specific command to be allowed to run with sudo without a password. We’ll run <code>sudo visudo</code> and then edit the file to add this line:</p>



<p><code>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tmutil</code></p>



<p>If you want to be even more secure, you can include the sha256 hash of tmutil. First get the hash by running <code>sha256sum /usr/bin/tmutil</code> and then adding this sha to your sudoers file. Mine looks like this</p>



<p><code>myuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: sha256:57a753bd2bef425205684630a676765913e1adca7ec0a9d73c205e4da32488c6 /usr/bin/tmutil</code></p>



<h2>Alternatives to app wrapper</h2>



<p>One thing I noticed with the wrapper app is that when it launches, it’s visible on my desktop. It could even grab my input for a moment, which is slightly annoying. It also felt weird to have a whole app just to wrap a script to give it Full Disk Access.</p>



<p>One alternative mentioned on the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/338213/how-to-run-a-launchagent-that-runs-a-script-which-causes-failures-because-of-sys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked StackOverflow page</a> above is to compile a binary app to wrap your shell script. I didn’t try it, since I am not using any compiled languages regularly.</p>



<p>Another thing I did try and will probably end up using is launching the script via the terminal. How? I already have passwordless (public key) SSH remote login access set up on my Mac. So I simply modified the launchd script slightly so it launches my script via ssh</p>


<pre title="">&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;ssh&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;myuser@myhost.local&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/path/to/code/timemachine-cleanup.sh&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
</pre>


<p>Since terminal is already set with FDA, this seems to work :)</p>



<p>It’s a bit of an awkward workaround to ssh to your own host with your own user in order to run a script, but it’s not that much different from compiling a binary to wrap your script, or wrapping it in an “app”.</p>



<h2>Why TimeMachine?</h2>



<p>I guess some people might rightfully question why I’m using TimeMachine and not a more flexible backup tool for Mac. I did consider it and tested a couple of options like CarbonCopyCloner and others. As far as I could tell, none of the commercial backup tools can create a full machine image on a remote network storage like TimeMachine does. If you know of something that does this, please let me know!</p>



<p>… and for those backup freaks out there: No. the Synology volume isn’t my only backup copy. I then also run restic to clone the TimeMachine volume to Backblaze B2 for offsite safekeeping.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<section>
    
    <article>
        <p>I've been writing on this blog for about 2 years now. This has been the longest I've stuck on to the same <em>technology stack</em> for my blog. I've previously jumped from a Jekyll based static site to a Medium blog before finally settling for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Hugo since 2018 but I don't recall as to <em>why</em> I went ahead with it. Maybe it was increasingly popular at that time and everyone touted Hugo as <em>the</em> solution to Static Site Generator (referred to as SSG from here on). There are 1000s of SSGs and at least a dozen of websites which lists all the SSGs out there. This is crazy by any standards. Hugo started as a generic blog generator but over the years it has become a <em>website generator</em>. It's no longer aimed at people who just want to have a small little static website/blog but supports all the use cases for people building full-fledged static websites. IMHO these two goals are overarching however this has resulted in a simple project to become incredibly complex over time.</p>
<h3 id="tipping-point">Tipping Point</h3>
<p>Anyway, so I wanted to change the look of the homepage on my website so I decided to look at Hugo's documentation. Hugo's documentation is great for someone who knows what exactly are they looking for. The documentation is so huge that you simply cannot grok it in one evening. I had zero ideas on how to customise the damn homepage of my blog and after spending hours buried in the documentation I was able to kind of figure the solution but it was unintuitive, to say the least. Apparently, to override any template from the theme, you have to mirror the directory structure of the theme in your root directory. Which meant, I needed to look at the source code of the theme, figure out the project structure, copy-paste all the folder names and put my override of <code>index.html</code> there. Which, BTW <strong>magically</strong> overrides it. This whole magic thing is BS and I am being strongly opinionated here.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to do something in Hugo. Different theme authors use different styles, which makes the whole thing even more complex. It also means for my customisations to work across themes, well you guessed it right: <strong>it's impossible</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered that I was unable to preview my Hugo website locally without internet because I had a Twitter <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet">shortcode</a> in one of my blog post (which makes an API call to Twitter to render a nice card preview). The site completely failed to render instead of just logging a warning. Bollocks.</p>
<p>The tipping point for me, however, was when the theme I was using stopped working with the latest version of Hugo at that point. So, picture this -- You make dozens of custom changes and then one update just <em>breaks</em> your website. Now not only you have to fix your shit but the theme you were using, you've to make upstream changes to the theme or maintain your own fork. And no, this is not a one-off experience. Hugo upgrades are a joke, they are known to break very very often.</p>
<p>I was done at this point. I didn't want to deal with this BS of continuously fighting the generator for my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-fresh-change">A fresh change</h3>
<p>Being a practitioner of <a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">Yak Shaving</a>, I discussed the idea of a "tinyhugo" with <a href="https://nadh.in/">Kailash</a> and <a href="https://www.saratchandra.in/">Sarat</a>. We'd arrived at a spec and I started writing some code to pander to my NIH syndrome.</p>
<p>However, I was still not convinced that a simpler solution doesn't exist. I spent countless hours exploring other alternatives. I'd used <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>, <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> before finally stumbling upon <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> from HN/Lobster discussions. I've got to say, the landing page gave a <em>fresh</em> feeling - one that I've not seen with any other alternatives. In fact quite opposite to the Eleventy landing page which looks like an over-engineered piece of software to generate websites (Not hating on it, there might be use cases for it, but the JS tooling and dependency system is something that I would not want to touch with a 10ft pole).</p>
<p>Zola's primary appeal to me was that like Hugo it's extremely fast and comes as a single binary no dependency package. I looked at the docs the first impression was they are concise enough to get a basic idea. Zola is strongly opinionated, even to the extent of dictating a project structure and sometimes filenames too. I actually preferred this over the <em>magic</em> Hugo does. In less than 2 hours I was able to port the home page of my blog (and tweak it to my liking) in Zola. I decided to abandon my own <code>tinyhugo</code> attempt because for the very fact Zola fits my needs very well.</p>
<p>The thing that I really loved about Zola is how it enforces a separation between <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/">Section</a> and <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/">Pages</a>. The section represents a "collection" of posts. So a <em>blog</em> can be a section, and I can have another section called "Book Reviews". I could easily tell Zola where to look for the templates by specifying the same in <code>content/book_reviews/_index.md</code>. I don't have to read Hugo docs or do <em>Google-fu</em> to figure this out, it's right there in the docs and very apparent.</p>
<p>For the record, I still don't know how to customise different templates for different sections in Hugo, but I couldn't care less.</p>
<h3 id="migration">Migration</h3>
<p>The migration was pretty straightforward -- I had to copy the <code>content folder</code>s of my blog (which are just a bunch of <code>.md</code> fikes) and replace <code>YAML</code> frontmatter to <code>TOML</code>. There were a few variable changes that I needed to do manually but since they were a manageable 20-25 posts, I did it by hand. I could potentially automate but then rabbit deep in the rabbit hole of Yak Shaving. The good part was that I was able to retain the same URL structure for my new blog because the URL scheme was based on the file paths.</p>
<p>I spent some time porting <a href="https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink">hugo-ink</a> to Zola and did minor CSS tweaks to it. Zola uses the Terra language for templating and it's much more pleasing to eyes than the Go Template syntax. Zola comes with pretty neat features like Search, RSS/Atom Feeds, Syntax Highlighting and SASS-&gt;CSS Processors.</p>
<p>What took me time however was to figure out how to get <code>opengraph</code> tags in each page. Hugo provides nifty <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/opengraph.html">template</a> for this use case but Zola is pretty barebones like that. People who care a lot about SEO need to spend some extra efforts here.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>Zola is still a pretty new kid on the block but the author shares the same frustration about Hugo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. Yes, this is a bit biased. -- <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola#-explanations">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reflects in the issues/PRs I've seen for Zola and the author is opinionated about not adding features which would make Zola complicated. Overall I am very happy with the switch and it was long due. I feel more confident in tweaking certain sections of my website. I plan to open-source the current theme in the next few days.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://git.mrkaran.dev/karan/website">Source Code</a> of this website if you'd like to explore how this website is built.</p>
<p>Fin!</p>

<p>DoubleSpend has obtained exclusive video footage of a man continuing to read a white paper after the occurrence of the first mathematical equation in the paper.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Web technologies have come so far, that you realize: not everything needs to be done in JavaScript nowadays anymore.</p><blockquote><p><em>»Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.« — Confucius</em></p></blockquote><p>My initial headline would have been:</p><p><em>How I wrote more JavaScript in the backend to eliminate JavaScript in the frontend.</em></p><p>But that's already a mouthful and also would have revealed too much and you might not have clicked my slightly clickbait-y title, right?</p><p>So here is my Public Service Announcement:</p><p> 📣 <strong>This site does not use any frontend JavaScript.<sup>*</sup></strong></p><p><em><small>*) There are only tiny exceptions on 2 pages, but for a good reason. More on that later.</small></em></p><p>First of all I am not against JavaScript (<span>JS</span>) at all. If you're building a web <strong>application</strong>, then this is not only totally fine but most likely a core requirement.</p><p>But I do have my pet peeve with <span>JS</span> for plain websites and blogs. Currently there is still such a strong draught in the static site generator world, telling us all our sites should be some kind of React or other frontend framework based project (looking at you, Gatsby, Next, Nuxt, VuePress, …). That you need to have that plentyful of code running in the browser of your visitors to have a smooth and <em>feels like a native app</em> user experience. That a site should be a <em>Single Page Application (SPA).</em> I can tell you, a plain HTML+CSS website does it really well, too. Surprise!</p><p>While on one hand the browser vendors add more and more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>, we also got a lot of improvement in the HTML and CSS area. Usually there is no big hype train around them, unless you are very enthusiastic and live in that niche.</p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> to get an idea what is possible today and what might come tomorrow. <em>Did you know that HTML5 is still iterated on and we're moving towards <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/">version 5.3</a>?</em> On the other hand »HTML 5« is also used as an umbrella term for a <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/" title="WHATWG Standards">wide variety of standards</a>. Also for CSS the story got very interesting: while CSS until 2.1 was a single specification, since CSS 3 there is a whole potpourri of recommendations and drafts. The <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/spec">wiki of the CSS Working Group</a> might be a good starting point for further discovery.</p><p>But I want to give you some more practical examples and an experience report:</p><h2 id="sticky-navigation-bar">Sticky navigation bar</h2><p>This is something you can observe here on this blog:</p><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hvc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hevc"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.h264.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=avc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9"></video><p>The key ingredient is the CSS <code>position: sticky</code> <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-sticky">🛈</a>. Even though most of them are labeled as <em>partial support,</em> this property value can be used in most scenarios except in some table related cases. If you want a sticky menu after scrolling and use only elements like <code>div</code> everything is just fine. I could throw away all the code for that after I realized that none of the common and modern browsers had any blocking issues. So I did. The only real latecomers were the web view components, no big deal for me here.</p><h3 id="before">Before</h3><h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4><pre><code><span>const </span><span>navbar </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.querySelector(</span><span>'.navbar'</span><span>);

             but determines at which point it sticks */
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3><p>The workaround with <span>JS</span> is no more. Yay!</p><p>Also notice how little code is actually needed now? Two CSS properties and the job is done.</p><hr><h2 id="service-workers">Service Workers</h2><p>Also in 2018 I played with <a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/04/progressive-web-app/">Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</a>. The whole blog was one. A few days ago I teared down all of it. At the core of PWAs sit <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/">Service Workers (SW)</a>, though you can use SW also without building an app. And that's what I was aiming for, but in the end my home-grown dynamic cache solution was more annoying to me than helpful for anyone else. Every time I updated anything here, I had to wait and/or force refresh to see the result. I'm sure some people probably see visual inconsistencies due to a still running service worker in their browser. If you do, try to force clear all data for this website.</p><p>Long story short: if you do not build a web <strong>app</strong>, you most likely do not need service workers. So yet another thing down from the <span>JS</span> list.</p><p>No <em>before/after</em> comparison here, but several precious kilobytes of JavaScript shaved off by removing them.</p><hr><h2 id="sqip-svg-lqip">SQIP (SVG LQIP)</h2><p><em>Woa, what are all these random acronyms here?</em> Don't worry, the simple answer is:</p><p>If you have images and they are not very small in file size, you maybe want to provide a temporary placeholder with very low resolution and quality. This is pretty useful for slow internet connections; living here in Germany I know how difficult this situation can be. That thing called internet is still very Neuland to us. 🤦</p><p>Anyway, <code>SQIP</code> can be translated with »<code>SVG</code>-based <code>LQIP</code>.«</p><p><code>SVG</code> are Scalable Vector Graphics, an image format I really love a lot, my logo is done with it (<a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/05/minimalism-focus-clean-redesign/">I wrote about it a while ago</a>).</p><p>LQIP finally stands for <em>»Low Quality Image Placeholders«</em> and is based on an algorithm to find primitive shapes to describe the source image. Basically try to find only a few triangles, rectangles, circles, ellipsis, and other low poly shapes. It is also an art form in its own, you can enjoy some <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive#static-animation">nice examples there</a>. The advantage of SVG is that it is made to encode such figures in very few characters of human readable text, so a less complex image for a placeholder can be written in one kilobyte or less.</p><p>Compared to the original high resolution image which can easily weigh half a megabyte and more this is great. You can reserve the space in your page and very early in the loading process display some visual hint that there will be a proper picture soon. Especially for types which do not support progessive loading (as JPEG can) using SQIP/LQIP placeholders makes a lot of sense.</p><p>In this scenario at first it was not really about saving frontend <span>JS</span>, more about saving it on the backend site and replacing it with something else. Unfortunately in between some code creeped into the frontend anyway.</p><p>But what happened that this beautiful technique fell out of favor with me?</p><h3 id="picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></h3><p>Enter another interesting HTML tag combo: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a> with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>.</p><p>So one reason to use small low quality placeholders is because before such tags became a thing we solely relied on a single <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and some trickery with CSS (and sometimes aided by sprinkles of JavaScript). I tried to avoid <span>JS</span> completely, but of course I had to use some styling hacks eventually.</p><p>The essence of it was some style attached to the image in question:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"highres-and-heavy.png"
     </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>background-size</span><span>: </span><span>cover</span><span>;
            </span><span>background-image</span><span>: </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>'data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2…'</span><span>);</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Usually in some post processing all style attributes were collected
     into a &lt;style&gt; tag or CSS file. --&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>The JavaScript entered this scenery at one point: after I used images with transparency. Sadly with this background image workaround you would've seen the low quality placeholder through the transparent parts, and this was extremly ugly to be honest. I could not stand it and deployed some snippet to trigger a background removal once the actual image was loaded:</p><pre><code><span>// remove the background image styling, so transparent images won't have
// strange SQIP artefacts shining through
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy][class]:not(.thumbnail):not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy].thumbnail:not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"thumbnail loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span></code></pre><p>Theoretically it would have been tolerable, but I noticed some strange behaviour once I started wrapping my images into <code>picture</code> tags.</p><p>Let's <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shave the yak</a> a bit further to understand why.</p><h4 id="webp-and-avif">WEBP and AVIF</h4><p><em>Come on, more acronyms?</em> I'm sorry, the web is a place with a lot of them.</p><p>All you need to know for now is that both of them are pretty modern image formats with quite good (lossy) compression rates while keeping a respectable quality. <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp"><code>WEBP</code></a> has been around for some time and most of the browsers do support it. <a href="https://caniuse.com/avif"><code>AVIF</code></a> is extremly new and right now only Chrome since version 85 and Opera 71 can display them. Firefox has a configuration flag, maybe they will enable it by default pretty soon.</p><p>So the current situation is that I have my original image (PNG or JPEG in most cases), a WEBP version, an AVIF version, and the SQIP placeholder. How do I deal with it? Back to our <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.avif" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/avif"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.webp" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/webp"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.png"
       </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/* SQIP data: see example above */</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>You can also use source sets for different view sizes based on media queries, but in my case I'm mainly concerned about supporting different image formats. My idea is to prioritize the formats with the smallest file size first, and given the compression ratios the order is usually: AVIF, WEBP, PNG/JPG. Not in every case will this be true; WEBP does not always have better savings then a decently compressed JPEG for example. AVIF has not disappointed so far, but sadly a part of my visitors will not see the effect yet.</p><p>What did not really happen anymore was a display of the placeholder before the final image was loaded. I experimented for quite some time until I realized that I do not want to spent more energy any further.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.png" alt="Size comparison of an example image; PNG original (22 KB), WEBP (14 KB, 37% saved), AVIF (7.3 KB, 67% saved)" width="1024" height="120" loading="lazy"></picture></p><p>I made a <em>risk-return tradeoff</em> compromise and got rid of SQIP altogether. For the growing number of AVIF support the images are sometimes significantly smaller which makes it acceptable to allow for some display delay anyway.</p><p>In the following screenshot the JPEG was the source photo. The PNG was created for some transparency stuff; of course, for photos this format does not really make a lot of sense in general. Sadly also WEBP fails to compete in this scenario. That's why I have to make this picture group generation a bit smarter soon to reorder based on the actual file …</p></div></div>

Jim is a great chef. He's too modest to say that about himself, but he's worked either as head chef or&nbsp;assistant&nbsp;head chef at a number of restaurants. Everywhere he's worked he's been dependent and reliable, prepared great food, worked well with the other chefs, and is generally a fun guy to have in the kitchen. Unfortunately, due to the poor economy and some bad decisions by management, Jim's restaurant is about to close, so Jim is out of work and looking for a new job.</p>
<p>
There's a new restaurant opening, a fancy place with many well-to-do investors. In Jim's world, chefs are hard to find, so Jim assumes he's a shoo-in for the job. Jim arrives at the interview at a Mexican restaurant, which feels like a great fit for Jim because Mexican food is his specialty. Jim calls up the restaurant on the phone and chats with the manager about a chef position, and the manager likes what he hears enough to schedule a job interview for Jim.</p>

<p>
Jim arrives at the interview and talks to the manager a bit. Things seem to be going well, Jim is in his element at a Mexican restaurant. The initial meeting goes well: Jim talks his job history, how much he cares about having a fresh house salsa, and how good his Baja sauce is. "Look up the Yelp reviews of my Baja sauce!" remarks Jim. "It's the #1 reason people came to the last restaurant I worked at." The manager smiles and nods, and informs Jim he looks great on paper, however the remainder of the interview will be conducted by all of the other chefs in the kitchen. "Awesome!" Jim thinks, "I have a rapport with other chefs. This should go smoothly."</p>

<p>
The first chef walks in, sits down at the table, and coldly stares at Jim's resume. "Can you write down a&nbsp;recipe for me?" he asks Jim, "There's a whiteboard over there, can you write down your preferred recipe for crème brûlée?"</p>

<p>
Jim is a bit dumbfounded, both by the request and being asked to demonstrate his cooking ability on a whiteboard. "I'm sorry," he says, "I don't know how to make&nbsp;crème brûlée. I thought this was a Mexican restaurant. Would you like to know my favorite recipe for Flan?"</p>

<p>
"No, that won't do," the assistant chef says. "Please write down how you would prepare&nbsp;crème brûlée"</p>

<p>
Jim is a bit taken aback, first because he's a specialist in Mexican food, and second because instead of being asked to cook, he's being asked to write stuff on a whiteboard. "I honestly don't know how to make&nbsp;crème brûlée," Jim says. "Perhaps you could let me google the recipe and I could actually try to prepare it for you, instead of just demonstrating a rote ability to memorize recipes and write them down on a whiteboard."</p>

<p>
"No, that won't do," says the interviewer, who jots down "lack of confectionary skills" in his notes. "Can you at least attempt to write down how you would prepare&nbsp;crème brûlée?"</p>
<p>
Jim feels embarrassed   and lost. He's being asked to do something he would never have to do in a professional capacity, and worse, rather than actually doing it, he's being asked to describe how he would do it on a whiteboard. Perhaps this is a test of Jim's ability to think on his feet, but given the position he's being asked to interview for and the question he's been presented, it's certainly an unfair one. Jim picks up the black marker and thinks hard about what the possible ingredients of&nbsp;crème brûlée would be.</p>
<p>
"Well," says Jim, "I'll need cream." Jim pulls the cap off the marker and attempts to write "1. Cream", however the marker is dry and the whiteboard is on wheels that roll back when Jim attempts to write. Jim only succeeds in making a long, barely perceptible mark on the whiteboard. Having made a messy mark on the whitebard, Jim looks for an eraser but there isn't one.</p>

<p>
"Yes," says the interviewer sarcastically, rolling his eyes, "<i>obviously</i> you need cream for&nbsp;crème brûlée. Try a different marker." Jim picks up the red marker and tries to write with that to the same result, it's dried out and won't work. Frustrated, Jim puts it down and tries the green marker, which works fine, however the board swivels vertically as he tries to write. Jim grabs the board in the upper right corner and finally manages to jot down "1. Cream"</p>

<p>
"Okay, we have the most obvious ingredient down," says the assistant chef. "Can you think of any other ingredients that would go into&nbsp;crème brûlée?"</p>

<p>
"Sugar," says Jim. The assistant chef nods, and Jim writes down sugar. "What else?"</p>

<p>
"Milk," says Jim, and he begins to write it down before he comes to the realization that the cream and milk are redundant. Jim doesn't often cook with cream. The interviewer shakes his head in exasperation   and pinches the bridge of his nose as Jim looks dumbfounded. "It's not milk brûlée," he says. Unfortunately, there's no eraser, so Jim tries to erase "3. Milk" with his hand, smearing green ink all over the board and his hand before asking "do you have an eraser?" The interviewer looks around unenthusiastically before shrugging no. Jim continues smearing the marker's ink across the surface of the board with his fingertips in a desperate attempt to compensate for the absence of an eraser.</p>

<p>
"Can you think of any other ingredients that might go in&nbsp;crème&nbsp;brûlée?" asks the interviewer, clearly bored.</p>

<p>
"Eggs?" asks Jim. The interviewer nods. Jim writes down "eggs". "What else?" the interviewer asks. Jim stares at what he's written down: cream, sugar, eggs. "Well," says Jim, "I assume some kind of flavoring. Chocolate perhaps?"</p>

<p>
"Wrong," says the interviewer. "Please write vanilla." Jim looks confused for a second and jots down vanilla as asked. The interviewer jots down "trouble with basic recipes" before asking "What other ingredients can you think of?"</p>

<p>
Jim stares at the ingredients so far: cream, sugar, eggs, vanilla. "Perhaps some water?" Jim guesses. The interviewer nods, and Jim writes down water. "Now, what are you missing?" asks the interviewer.</p>

<p>
Jim stares at the list: cream, sugar, eggs, vanilla, water. Those seem like they should be the basic ingredients, and the interviewer rejected additional flavoring that wasn't vanilla. Jim is stupefied... he can't think of anything else. Taking a stab in the dark, Jim suggests "Salt?"</p>

<p>
The assistant chef does a facepalm and sighs, before looking up at Jim and stating the obvious solution: "the units. Your recipe is lacking units." The ambiguity of the interviewer's question has caught Jim off guard, especially when he professed no idea of what the recipe was to being with, and worse, he has absolutely no idea what the units should be. He stares at the whiteboard for awhile before asking "how much&nbsp;crème&nbsp;brûlée are we making?"</p>

<p>
"That's up to you," says the interviewer, "how many servings would you like to prepare?"</p>

<p>
Jim has absolutely no clue. He's not a confectioner, but he doesn't want to completely bomb the interview, so he ventures a guess. "I'd like to prepare 2 servings. Let's try a cup of cream, a teaspoon of vanilla, two tablespoons of sugar, 4 eggs, and a cup of water."</p>

<p>
"Those aren't the right proportions," say the interviewer. "You should use a quart of cream, two quarts water, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, a cup of sugar, and six eggs to produce six servings. Let's move on to the recipe. Can you write it down on the whiteboard for me?"</p>

<p>
Now Jim is completely lost. The ingredients of a recipe he has no clue about are something he can guess at, but how is he supposed to guess the recipe itself? He takes his best shot.</p>

<p>
"Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them with the cream and sugar," guesses Jim.</p>

<p>
"Wrong," says the interviewer.</p>

<p>
"Whisk them with the cream and vanilla?" asks Jim.</p>

<p>
"Still wrong," says the interviewer, "but you were closer the first time."</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to keep guessing?" asks Jim. The interviewer sighs, writes down "completely incompetent", stands up, and says "Thank you for your time. I'll go get the next person."</p>

<p>
Jim stands by the whiteboard and feels confused and out of place. He wonders what&nbsp;crème&nbsp;brûlée has to do with preparing Mexican food. He sits down at the table and googles for&nbsp;crème&nbsp;brûlée on his phone, quickly scanning over the recipe and thinking "that doesn't look too hard at all, I could probably make a great&nbsp;crème&nbsp;brûlée if I had a little practice." The recipe for&nbsp;crème&nbsp;brûlée is in fact quite similar to Flan, and Jim can make great Flan, but unfortunately, the interviewer won't even know as he hasn't asked Jim to cook anything.&nbsp;The next interviewer comes into the room.</p>

<p>
He sits down at the table and scans over Jim's résumé, making a few grunts after scrutinizing various items. "You didn't go to&nbsp;culinary&nbsp;school?"</p>

<div><p>
"No," says Jim, "but I've loved cooking since I was a little kid. I used to cook dinner with my mom every night. I've been working professionally as a chef all my life, and I can prepare great food. Why don't you just take me to the kitchen and let me show you?"</p><p>

"That won't be necessary," says the interviewer. "Now, can you please write on the whiteboard how you would prepare a cheese danish?" Unfortunately, Jim is not a pastry chef either.</p><p>
. &nbsp; . &nbsp; .</p>
<p>
The manager has returned to conclude the interview. "Well Jim," he says, "we've discussed the issue, and we don't think you'd be a good fit here."</p><p>

At this point Jim is entirely expecting this response. Jim is most comfortable in a kitchen, preparing food hands on. He feels out of place trying to explain the theoretical act of preparing food with a whiteboard.&nbsp;Jim loves food so much that whenever he went out for a smoke break with his fellow chefs, he continued to talk about food even when they were on break. Unfortunately, during the interview he didn't get the opportunity to discuss food in this sort of context. Instead he was asked only pointed questions about food items he didn't know how to prepare.</p><p>

"I see," says Jim. "Can I ask you one question before I go?"</p><p>

"Okay," says the manager.</p><p>

"Throughout this interview," Jim asked, "I was asked about preparing confections and pastries, but not once …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Recently I’ve got into the idea of building a personal platform for myself. By that I mean a system which makes it easy to distribute new things I’m working on and a way to grow the group of people who could be interested in what I’m working on.</p>



<h2>How I’m going about building a platform</h2>



<ol><li>Leveraging what I already have<ol><li>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjRhOxof_h24gemf8If3Klw?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel</a> with a following</li><li>I have a network from my personal and professional life</li></ol></li><li>More content<ol><li>This blog</li><li>“Computer Security: Attacking and defending web apps” course on Udemy (because my most successful content on YouTube is about Cyber Security and I’ve had a lot of demand for making a video on how to write shell code)</li><li><a href="https://scenario95.com/">Scenario95</a></li></ol></li><li>Creating a pipeline which I use for all new content<ol><li>Send an email to followers of my platform</li><li>Sharing on several platforms including: Facebook, HackerNews, Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn</li></ol></li></ol>



<h2>Why I’m doing this?</h2>



<p>When coming up with new ideas I’ve noticed that I often base them around what I already have access to and natural advantages I’ve got. For example when on a course topic for Udemy, I referred to the YouTube video which I released 4 years ago… and I’ve realised that since finishing university I haven’t done a good job of continuing to create things like this.</p>







<p>This is something I’m new to and and still learning the ropes so if you’ve got any advice please leave it in the comments below. </p>



<p>If you want to follow my adventure then subscribe to my platform! </p>

                    <p>I had a problem. I wanted public documentation with open collaboration, but I couldn't afford most of the products out there. As a startup we need to keep lean, and adding a paid documentation/knowledge base service is an expense I don't want to have to try to recover.</p><p>So we're moving all of our product documentation into public Github repositories, as it's the cheapest option with it being free 😉</p><p>The first repository is here, for our Signata MFA product: <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs">https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs</a></p><h3 id="why-github">Why Github?</h3><p>As much as I find it frustrating to write documentation in markdown (writing is easy, dealing with screenshots is clunky), the benefits of having a publicly accessible repository for documentation far outweighs my frustration.</p><p>I want to make sure documentation isn't sitting behind paywalls or needing a sign up. In fact, forcing people to sign up to read it has created a ton of accounts in our system that don't actually get used, which is an inconvenience for both parties.</p><p>The best part of putting it into Github is now there's the ability to collaborate - if you find a problem, or ambiguous statement, or you want something added, you can now directly interact with the content to submit pull requests or open issues.</p><p>We've also put a link to the documentation onto the Signata MFA website in a few places, which you'll also notice has undergone some rebranding:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image.png 600w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image.png 1000w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png 1458w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's actually quite expensive to run an online knowledgebase in most instances. <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> would've been the ideal choice, but it's only free for open source projects, and at this stage we don't yet have plans to open source our products. I could've spun up a self-hosted service like Dokuwiki, but that would be an additional $10/month of operating costs, as well as the administrative overhead for keeping it up to date.</p><p>An alternative we thought about was to use publicly accessible Google Docs, but they lose the ability to be indexed by search engines for people to actually find these guides. There's not much use to public documentation if it's not actually discoverable by the public.</p><h3 id="signata-mfa-presentation">Signata MFA Presentation</h3><p>I've also thrown a presentation that we put together about Signata MFA into the repository as well. <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs/blob/main/signata-mfa-overview-presentation.pdf">You can find it here</a> - it'll give you a quick overview of the product, it's capabilities, it's pricing, and how to get in contact with us.</p><p>Have you looked at Signata MFA? <a href="https://mfa.signata.net/">You can check it out by clicking here</a>. You can try it for free for a month, no credit card required.</p>

<p>“Legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests. … And, if a State should provide that the votes of citizens in one part of the State should be given two times, or five times, or 10 times the weight of votes of citizens in another part of the State, it could hardly be contended that the right to vote of those residing in the disfavored areas had not been effectively diluted.” Reynold v Sims</p>
<p>The US Senate has incredible legislative and “advise and consent” powers. It passes bills, but also approves treaties, confirms Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court justices, judges, and other officials.</p>
<p>It’s 2020, and:</p>

<li>~33% of the population lives in just 4 states—California, Texas, Florida, and New York—and is represented by just 8 Senators.</li>

<p>In 1790, the gap between the smallest and largest states was about 10x. Today, the most populous state, California, is about 70x more populous than the least populous state, Wyoming. A resident of California, New York, Florida, or Texas has no effective impact on the Senate impact, and a resident of a smaller state Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, the Dakotas, Delaware, Rhode Island, or Maine has a disproportionate impact on the Senate.</p>
<p>While the Electoral College favors smaller states as well, it is still mostly driven by membership in the House of Representatives, which is proportionate to population. That’s unfair—the popular vote loser became president in 2000 and 2016— but it’s far less unfair than the even-more-undemocratic Senate.</p>
<p><strong>The Senate has become the defining slow-motion crisis of American democracy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The US Senate could be the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/senate-washington-dc-puerto-rico-statehood-filibuster-obama-biden-racist.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">most structurally racist institution</a>.</strong> In the 1960s, Black people from the South <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">migrated to populous Northern states</a>, eroding their political representation in the Senate. Similarly, recent decades have seen <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">growing Latinx populations in urban areas</a>, primarily located in populous states. As a result, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/opinion/dc-puerto-rico-statehood-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Leonhardt found</a> that whites have 0.35 Senators per million people, Blacks have 0.26, Asian-Americans 0.25, and Latinos just 0.19.</li>
<li><strong>Partisanship and rule changes have caused the problem to boil over.</strong> According to <a href="https://govtrackinsider.com/the-senate-has-never-been-as-un-democratic-as-it-was-in-2017-2018-and-minority-rule-could-801e1046af28" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a 2018 analysis</a>, the Senate has never been as undemocratic as it was in 2017-2018. According to this analysis, “in 2017, for the first time, the Senate’s decisions were often made by a coalition of states representing less than half of the country’s population. The median share of senators supporting passed bills, confirmed judges and agency leaders, and other matters dropped to 58% (the lowest since 1930), with those senators representing just 49.5% of the U.S. population (the lowest ever)!”</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time for us to revisit the Connecticut Compromise, the Devil’s Bargain that allowed for the adoption of the Constitution at the expense of a democratic Senate.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-role-of-the-senate"><a href="#whats-the-role-of-the-senate" aria-label="whats the role of the senate permalink"></a>What’s the Role of the Senate?</h2>
<p>The Senate is a smaller, more deliberative body than the House of Representatives. You have to be 30 years old to run for the Senate, and in 1790, you would have had an average life expectancy of about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885717/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">45 years</a>. Indeed, “Senator” comes from the Latin word “senex,” which means “senior” or “old man.”</p>
<p>Senators run on staggered 6-year terms, not the 2-year term of the House. That means that their terms exceed presidential terms and—unlike representatives—they don’t have to run in every election. While there are 435 representatives in the House, there are only 100 senators. Unlike members of the House, Senate representatives were meant to be appointed by the state legislatures, a process that changed after the 17th amendment in 1913. This meant that the Senate was meant to be a kind of U.N.-but-with-teeth for 13 (and now 50) coequal sovereigns.</p>
<p>These features—insulation from short-term political pressure and a more selective and deliberative group of representatives—are unrelated to the two-per-state design of the US Senate, and don’t benefit from it.</p>
<h2 id="the-connecticut-compromise-was-pragmatic-but-not-wise"><a href="#the-connecticut-compromise-was-pragmatic-but-not-wise" aria-label="the connecticut compromise was pragmatic but not wise permalink"></a>The Connecticut Compromise was Pragmatic, but Not Wise</h2>
<p>Some people defend the Connecticut Compromise as an enduring legacy of founder wisdom. But the Connecticut Compromise wasn’t meant to be wise, it was meant to be pragmatic. </p>
<p>Seven weeks into the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the founders were at an impasse.</p>
<p>Many large states felt that representation should be proportional to population in Congress. As larger states would be contributing more to the treasury and defense, they felt that should have more say.</p>
<p>Smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island—and representatives from certain larger but slower-growing states like New York (except for Alexander Hamilton, of course)—weren’t having it, and had leverage. These states enjoyed authority and autonomy under the Articles of Confederation. Proportionate representation—plus anticipation of a rapidly growing South and West—would erode their political power.</p>
<p>Connecticut delegates Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, with the support of Benjamin Franklin, struck a compromise: a bicameral (two-chambered) legislature, with one chamber, the House of Representatives, allocating seats in proportion to population, and the other chamber, the Senate, allocated evenly by state. Benjamin Franklin proposed that the House originate all revenue matters.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton hated it. Writing in Federalist 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government, which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail. Sophistry may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common-sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madison, in Federalist 62, didn’t want to defend it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision to allocate Senate seats was a compromise needed to ratify the Constitution and satisfice an existing power structure—nothing more.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution"><a href="#this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution" aria-label="this is the hardest thing to change about the constitution permalink"></a>This is the Hardest Thing to Change about the Constitution</h2>
<p>One possible mechanism of reform is amending the Constitution. Suppose you wanted to change the Senate to allocate seats in proportion to population. Not so fast—Article V of the Constitution writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution,</strong> or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; <strong>and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article V articulates a state right—equal suffrage in the Senate—that cannot be deprived through the Constitutional change process. Put differently: you can change anything in the Constitution (after 1808) through amendments or a convention, but you cannot change this aspect of the Connecticut Compromise.</p>
<p>In practice, even Justice Scalia <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/the-weirdest-sentence-in-the-u-s-constitution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">once remarked</a> that he didn’t see how the Supreme Court could declare a properly proposed and ratified Constitutional amendment unconstitutional. It is unclear how a future Supreme Court might view a dispute around this kind of Constitutional amendment, although any well-written amendment would begin by changing Article V.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this speed bump, passing constitutional amendments requires the consent of 3/4 of the states, meaning that the 12 least populous states could block any Senate reform amendment.</p>

<p>An improvement to the representation problem has the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is legal. In this sense, legal means that it would survive a challenge in the Supreme Court in which the justices were approved by a partisan Senate.</li>
<li>It preserves the “deliberative” aspects of the Senate.</li>
<li>It reduces population inequality in the Senate.</li>
<li>It is politically tractable.</li>
</ul>
<p>A better solution to this problem has these additional properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>New statehood, or reorganized statehood, is incentive-compatible. That means that citizens of prospective new states (Puerto Rico, for instance) should have the opportunity to form a state and be admitted to the Senate without disproportionately diluting power.</li>
<li>Senate proportionality is robust to population shifts. If Wyoming became a booming population center, then Wyoming should have more Senate representation.</li>
<li>It decreases wasted votes and reduces the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">efficiency gap</a>.

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Especially after COVID-19 began plaguing the planet, QR codes have been a big part of our daily lives. In this day and age, it’s quite impossible for one to have never seen a QR code, or used one. Even before the pandemic, QR codes had been around us for a while, but many of us — having grown up in the Digital Age — simply accept new technology into our lives without wondering too much about how they work. For most of us, QR codes just look like... square pixelated versions of the alien heptapod symbols in Arrival (2016), that somehow, magically (and really quickly) bring us to a different screen when we scan them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So what are these cryptic codes? Are they magic? Clearly they’re not, but how do they work? Before we take you in for the ride, let’s get the basics down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QR stands for <em>Quick Response</em>, and a QR code is pretty much a barcode (which has been around since the 1950s) except two-dimensional. Because it’s 2D, it can contain more data than a barcode. It can encode over 7000 characters, which is a vast improvement from the standard barcode with a limited capacity of about 20 alphanumeric characters.</p>
<h2>How did they come about?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In Japan circa 1990s, Denso Wave Incorporated was contacted by manufacturing sites and asked if it was possible to come up with a faster barcode scanning system. This presented a problem as barcodes had a limited capacity, which made the scanning process time consuming for workers no matter how efficient the scanner was. To tackle this, Denso Wave began developing a compact code that can contain more data, including Kanji and Kana characters. The launch of the QR code was later announced in 1994.</p>
<h2>What are they used for?</h2>
<p>The QR code was first used by the auto industry to track parts and products shipped around the globe. Then, gradually, other industries all over the world began joining in. Today, QR codes are used by nearly every physical and digital establishment for quick check-ins, displaying geolocation or contact info, redirecting customers to their websites, etc.</p>
<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<p>Grasping how a QR code works would require understanding the functions of its different parts. With the help of the labelled diagram, we hope to make this palatable for the layman. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png" alt="QR Structure, modules, separators, alignment, timing, format info, version, labels, black and white" width="715" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=358&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 358w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 715w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1073&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1073w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1430&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1430w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1788&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1788w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=2145&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 2145w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"></p>

<p>The tiny squares in a QR code are called <em><strong>modules</strong></em> - black squares would be considered foreground modules, and white ones would be background modules. They don’t always have to be black and white, though, they could be in color too. Most QR codes are in black and white only so decoder softwares easily distinguish the contrast between the background and foreground. If you want your QR code to be colorful, you just have to make sure that the contrast is retained when it is in grayscale / black and white.</p>
<p>The bigger the code, the more rows and columns of modules it will contain. Yup, just like humankind, QR codes come in different shapes, sizes and colors (although there are standards to follow).</p>
<p>There are 40 preset sizes (or, <em><strong>versions</strong></em>) to choose from. Version 1 being the smallest type with 21 rows and 21 columns, and Version 40 being the largest with 177 rows and 177 columns. When a generator produces a code for you, it will determine the suitable QR code version number for you depending on the amount of data you are encoding.</p>
<p>The 3 big squares on 3 corners of the QR code are <em><strong>finder patterns</strong></em>, which help your device camera determine the boundaries of the code and its correct orientation. This is so if the code is rotated, or upside-down, decoders would still be able to read it. These finder patterns are surrounded by a single-module spacing called <em><strong>separators</strong></em> which help decoders separate the finder patterns from the code data.</p>
<p>Connecting each finder pattern are <em><strong>timing patterns</strong></em> that alternate between black and white. These lines tell your decoder software how big the data cells are within the code.</p>
<p>The smaller square (that is distinctively not a finder pattern) on the fourth corner is an <em><strong>alignment pattern</strong></em> that helps the decoder prevent image distortions. Level 1 QR codes (the smallest size of QR codes) do not contain alignment patterns. The bigger the code, however, the more alignment patterns are added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15 bits beside the separators are <em><strong>format and version strings</strong></em> which contain information on the code’s error correction level and the chosen mask pattern for the particular code. Hold on… information on the what and what?</p>
<p><em><strong>Error correction</strong></em> code makes sure that the code is still readable if up to 30% of the code is corrupt. Designers or generators of a code can decide how many levels of error correction they want to include in the code. The higher the level of error correction, the higher percentage of corruption a decoder can read past. However, the higher the level of error correction, the more space it takes up on the QR code, leaving less space for data. In other words, the more space the error correction code takes up, the lower the max numerical characters a QR code can fit. How much error correction a QR code needs probably will depend on where it will be displayed. E.g. A QR code on a paper flyer would need higher error correction than one on a laminated poster placed indoors, and a digital QR code could do with none because it is unlikely to be damaged.</p>
<p>The code is also overlaid by a <em><strong>mask pattern</strong></em>, inverting and retaining certain data areas to “mix it up” / conceal it. Decoder softwares detect the mask type from the format information and demask the QR code before reading the rest of the data. Of course this happens in a matter of milliseconds.</p>
<p><em><strong>Encoded characters </strong></em>- The black and white modules read in a fixed zigzaggy direction (as shown in the image), starting from the bottom right corner, gives the decoder a sequence of data bits that goes something like 001010111…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different binary sequences represent different codewords, which include symbols, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, etc. For example, the binary sequence 01110111 represents the letter ‘w’, 00100001 represents the exclamation point ‘!’, and 00100000 represents a space.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you make a QR code?</strong></h2>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mi8ate-UiC0ZpKEoRFn8EUpe5bZDS5O6ggTSK96wPR1OTHx_zoKu_dbS5NvJDpPRsDAt9qdHXkQdfo1sm8Jun4Id0dpS3JjSnmOO51mXv6NT1ql7rb5P0DJc01k-kuw9RYw5vMF2" alt="QR code, generated QR code, snappymob website" width="297"></span></p>
<p>Here’s a QR code generated with <a href="http://www.qr-code-generator.com/"><span>www.qr-code-generator.com</span></a>. Do the patterns make a lot more sense to you now? If you can’t answer in confidence, that’s okay. You’re not going to have to make one by hand, ever. (Unless you want to.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are plenty of offline and online QR code generators free for use. All you have to do is key in what you want to encode in the QR code, be it a link to a coupon redemption page, a YouTube video, your social media sites, your contact details, or simply a website homepage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most free QR code generators, though, require you to sign up or subscribe to a plan to gain access to more design options and features, such as error correction levels and insights tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How can QR codes help you?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you own a business or simply have a web page to share, a QR code could help people reach you easily and quickly. In case you were looking for ideas, here are some of the ways in which using a QR code could greatly benefit you:</p>
<h4><strong>Webpages and Location</strong></h4>
<p>Your customers can get to your website, social media platforms, or map location in a matter of seconds. They don’t have to manually type your website URL, usernames, or addresses into their browsers or maps. They simply need to whip out their phones and scan the QR code to be redirected to you.</p>
<h4><strong>Payment</strong></h4>
<p>Payment is also made easy with QR codes. Most stores enable QR codes for quick payment via e-wallets so customers don’t have to fumble through their wallets for cash and keep others waiting. Some good examples would be GrabPay or ShopeePay, which are enabled at many on and offline merchants in Malaysia.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg" alt="grabpay, shopeepay, qr code, merchant, scan to pay, app" width="648" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=324&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 324w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 648w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=972&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 972w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1296&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1296w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1620&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1620w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1944&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"><br>(Image Source: help.shopee.com.my, grab.com)</p>
<h4><strong>Email and Direct Messaging</strong></h4>
<p>You can embed URL links that lead straight to a ‘compose email’ or ‘compose direct message’ page (for instance, <a href="mailto:hello@snappymob.com">mailto:hello@snappymob.com</a>) into your QR code. For email, this saves your customers up to 10 seconds because it helps them skip the process of opening their email app, tapping on compose email, and typing your email address manually into the recipient bar. For social media, this saves them the effort of opening the app, typing your username into the search bar, and tapping on the message button. This might literally be “a matter of seconds” which seems small, but it keeps people who are interested in your services or products, well, interested. Making things quicker and easier for your patrons is always a good move.</p></span></p><p><label>app insights</label></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<figure>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stacking-videos.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" title="stacking-videos" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stacking-videos.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">

<p>Often times, when you want to compare two videos side-by-side or you want to create an effect during post-processing, you might want to stack videos together. It can get expensive if you end up buying a tool to do this, but, guess what? </p>



<p><strong>FFmpeg offers a variety of tools to help stack videos together – horizontally, vertically, or in a grid fashion. In this tutorial, let’s learn about FFmpeg’s <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters for stacking videos. </strong></p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="How_to_Stack_Videos_Horizontally_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>How to Stack Videos Horizontally using FFmpeg?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Horizontally stacking videos” refers to placing videos side-by-side (one on the left and the other on the right). </p>



<p>Before you do this, there are a couple of points that you need to consider. </p>



<ol><li>The videos that you want to stack need to have the same height. </li><li> The videos need to have the same pixel format. </li></ol>



<p>The command line is shown below where we try and stack two <code>mp4</code> videos. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex hstack=inputs=2 horizontal-stacked-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The <code>hstack</code> filter has a simple format. You need to specify the number of inputs and it parses that from the beginning portion of the commandline. The order of stacking follows the order of inputs. </p>



<p>Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4FwbqByqDpDpOGTNvpSWSOh6RVE9yzesrQyAyGvaOF1ZjVsycKOlQUjrTmdJRFJWblHjC9gF6zMds0s5w2Yy2w6CVXXme-H-zF8nYoJ496khN0aHXHaWbnwEe41BYmu6c2mdoQb8" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>And, here is a video! </p>

<p>Here is another use case. Companies or teams working on video compression often like to compare videos side-by-side in the lab or showcase their work in conferences. FFmpeg’s horizontal stacking is an easy way to do this and achieve a very good result. </p>



<p>Below are two videos encoded at different video quality settings and stacked horizontally. Comparison made simple, right? <em>(note: Vimeo’s choise of bitrate might mess with the comparison, but, when done offline (downloaded), the <code>hstack</code> filter makes comparisons easy!)</em></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476095363" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_Vertically_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>Stacking Videos Vertically using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Vertically stacked videos” results in placing videos one below the other. Unlike in horizontal stacking, inputs need to be having the same width. The command is as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For vertical stacking, we need to use the <code>vstack</code> filter whose syntax is similar to the <code>hstack</code> filter we used in the previous horizontal stacking example.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 vertical-stack-output.mp4</code></pre>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qtyxioWFR54pqwZhX7jgX6HkSG7gCw840GdK78HGHHP7X3sv3fr3Pou9hOMFu2O-e6O7nmCith3U6CM1SpDanhwmIFIBzZUQyaG4T0BJaF9QCdMIPrmMmH0qc9WTK5f-5Nf4-92y" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Both functions pretty much use the same commands with a simple distinction, the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>hstack</code></a> and the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#vstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>vstack</code></a> under the <code>-filter_complex</code> argument.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a video of stacking two videos vertically using FFmpeg. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731607" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths"></span><strong>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Well, there’s a really nifty ability for both of these to prioritize the length of the shortest video. And as luck would have it the parameter is named <code>shortest</code>, and it’s applicable to both the horizontal and vertical stacking filters. Using <code>shortest=1</code> ensures the shortest length is used. </p>



<p>For example – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -filter_complex hstack=inputs=2:shortest=1 shortest-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>As a <b>side note</b>, if you run into an error that claims frames are being duplicated, the easiest workaround is to slip the <code>vsync 2</code> parameter into your command, and it worked like a charm.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_Without_the_shortest_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths Without the <code>shortest</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>To test what happens in this situation, let’s stack two videos vertically – a 10 second clip and an 18 second clip. You’ll see that the shorter clip just stops after it completes, but the output video continues till the longest of the input clips complete.  </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731684" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>











<p>If you want to truncate the clips to the length of the shortest clip, then you need to use the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter. Let’s look at that in the next section.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_With_the_shortest=1_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths With the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>In this example, we use the <code>shortest=1</code> command-line parameter and as you can see, the length of the final video is truncated to the length of the shortest of the inputs. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="2%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong><strong>2×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong></strong><span></span></h2>



<p>We can achieve a 2×2 grid of videos using a combination of the <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. Let’s start by looking at the command-line and then break it down. It’s actually pretty simple! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]; \
[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]; \
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p>What’s happening here?</p>



<ul><li>firstly, you need to provide 4 input videos with the same height and width</li><li>next, you stack the first two videos horizontally and call it “top” i.e. <code>[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]</code></li><li>then, you you stack the next two videos horizontally and call it “bottom” i.e. <code>[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]</code></li><li>then, you stack <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> vertically to create a 2×2 grid. — <code>[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]</code></li><li>then using the <code>map</code> command, we can extract and push the video track to the output container. </li></ul>



<p>Here is what the video looks like. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475771172" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="3%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>3×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Along the same lines, here is a 3×2 grid of videos using <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 \
-i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-i input4.mp4 -i input5.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v][2:v]hstack=inputs=3[top];\
[3:v][4:v][5:v]hstack=inputs=3[bottom];\
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475780643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi All! Today I want to show a quick’n’dirty way to easily deploy your projects to Azure using Powershell.</p><p>I’ve been working a lot recently with Azure Functions and Web Apps. And of course, each time I’m confident with my code, I want to see it deployed on the Cloud.</p><p>Of course in an ideal world, we all would have a nice CI/CD pipeline, potentially on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure DevOps</a>. It might happen, however, that for one reason or another, you can only get up to CI, without being able to deploy.</p><p>So the only option you have is to manually handle deployments, most likely from your local machine. But what happens if you have to deploy it to multiple destinations?</p><p>In my case, for example, I had to deploy a Function App and a Web App to multiple client subscriptions. Of course, you can always do this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure?view=vs-2019&amp;WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly from Visual Studio</a>, but it still feels like a lot of manual work.</p><h4>What if instead you can have a very nice script that handles all the grunt work for you?</h4><p>Moreover, you could potentially reuse it when you finally manage to get to the Continuous Deployment part.</p><p>So, the first step is to create the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/artifacts-overview?view=azure-devops&amp;WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Release Artifact</a>. I am assuming, of course, that you’ve ran already <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/testing-azure-functions-on-azure-devops-part-1-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your Tests</a> and everything went fine.</p><p>My weapon of choice for these scripts today, will be Powershell:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function publish{
    param(
        $projectName        
    )

    $projectPath="src/$($projectName)/$($projectName).csproj"
    $publishDestPath="publish/" + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString()

    log "publishing project '$($projectName)' in folder '$($publishDestPath)' ..." 
    dotnet publish $projectPath -c Release -o $publishDestPath

    $zipArchiveFullPath="$($publishDestPath).Zip"
    log "creating zip archive '$($zipArchiveFullPath)'"
    $compress = @{
        Path = $publishDestPath + "/*"
        CompressionLevel = "Fastest"
        DestinationPath = $zipArchiveFullPath
    }
    Compress-Archive @compress

    log "cleaning up ..."
    Remove-Item -path "$($publishDestPath)" -recurse

    return $zipArchiveFullPath
}</pre><p>Here I’m building a temporary path using a GUID and calling <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dotnet publish</a> </em>to compile the Project and output the binaries to it. Then we generate a Zip archive and get rid of the publish folder.</p><p>The <em>log </em>function is just a simple wrapper over <em>Write-Host</em>, I just added some fancy colors to highlight the text:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function log{
    param(
        $text
    )

    write-host $text -ForegroundColor Yellow -BackgroundColor DarkGreen
}</pre><p>Now that we have our Artifact, the next step is to deploy it to Azure. If you, like me, are working with Azure Functions, this is the script for you:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function deploy{
    param(
        $zipArchiveFullPath,
        $subscription,
        $resourceGroup,        
        $appName
    )    

    log "deploying '$($appName)' to Resource Group '$($resourceGroup)' in Subscription '$($subscription)' from zip '$($zipArchiveFullPath)' ..."
    az functionapp deployment source config-zip -g "$($resourceGroup)" -n "$($appName)" --src "$($zipArchiveFullPath)" --subscription "$($subscription)"   
}</pre><p>It simply takes the full path to the zip archive we produced before and the name of the destination Azure Subscription, Resource Group and Application. Easy peasy.</p><p>Now, I’ve found particularly handy to set some basic application settings, right after the deployment. For this, I keep a simple JSON file with key/value pairs and deploy it using this script:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function setConfig{
    param(
        $subscription,
        $resourceGroup,        
        $appName,
        $configPath
    )
    log "updating application config..."
    az functionapp config appsettings set --name "$($appName)" --resource-group "$($resourceGroup)" --subscription "$($subscription)" --settings @$configPath
}</pre><p>The config file can be something like this:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="json" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">{
  "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",  
  "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "DEV",
  "Foo": "bar"
}
</pre><p>The last step is to put everything together and call it. I would suggest to create a separate script with all the previous functions. We can use it as a “library” and if we’re lucky enough, it won’t even change much when we move to CD.</p><p>For our <em>local</em> deployment script we will instead need two more helper function. The first one will take care of the Artifact:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function createArtifact {
    param(
        $appName
    )
    $zipPath = publish $appName
    if ($zipPath -is [array]) {
        $zipPath = $zipPath[$zipPath.Length - 1]
    }
    return $zipPath
}</pre><p>We can’t unfortunately call directly the <em>publish </em>function because seems that the output from the <em>dotnet publish</em> command will mess a bit with the return value. So we’ll need to do some magic tricks, but not that much.</p><p>Then we can send the artifact to the cloud:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">function deployInstance {
    param(      
        $zipPath,  
        $subscription,
        $resourceGroup,        
        $appName,
        $configPath
    )

    deploy $zipPath $subscription $resourceGroup $appName

    if(![string]::IsNullOrEmpty($configPath)){
        setConfig $subscription $resourceGroup $appName $configPath
    }
}</pre><p>If you remember, at the top of the post I said that we might have to deploy the same artifact to multiple destination. Now that we have everything in place, all we have to do is just put the pieces together:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$zipPath = createArtifact "MyAwesomeProject" 
deployInstance $zipPath "MyFirstSubscription" "MyFirstResourceGroup" "MyAwesomeProject1" "DEV.settings.json"
deployInstance $zipPath "MySecondSubscription" "MySecondResourceGroup" "MyAwesomeProject2" "DEV.settings.json"
deployInstance $zipPath "MyThirdSubscription" "MyThirdResourceGroup" "MyAwesomeProject3" "DEV.settings.json"</pre><p>…and so on and so forth. I think you got the idea.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>“Amazing”, “Beautiful”, “Incredible”, “Unreal”, “Brought tears to my eyes”.</p>



<p>These are all comments that repeatedly appeared in response to a viral Facebook video of a drone light show that <a href="https://verge.aero/">Verge Aero</a> flew to show gratitude for healthcare and essential workers in Philadelphia. The response was overwhelming, and these words demonstrate that when properly executed, drone light shows are a mesmerizing and powerful experience. Since then, we’ve received many questions about our technology, and we’d like to share our responses with a wider audience.</p>



<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/415494003" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<h2><strong>What is a drone light show, exactly?</strong></h2>



<p>Drone light shows are performed by illuminated, synchronized, and choreographed groups of drones that arrange themselves into various aerial formations. Almost any image can be recreated in the sky by a computer program that turns graphics into flight commands and communicates them to the drones.</p>



<p>In recent years, drone shows have migrated from the university laboratory to being deployed at scale on prominent events around the world. We were originally inspired by this 2012 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vijay_kumar_robots_that_fly_and_cooperate">TED video</a> featuring the University of Pennsylvania’s Dean of Engineering, Vijay Kumar, demonstrating drone fleets doing all kinds of stunning maneuvers. Later, pioneering work was done in Europe by the <a href="https://www.spaxels.at/">Spaxels Research Initiative</a>, <a href="https://collmot.com/">Collmot</a>, and <a href="http://www.veritystudios.com/">Verity</a>.<a href="https://www.intel.com/"> Intel</a> has done the most to popularize the concept, flying drone shows on big events such as the Super Bowl halftime show and the Winter Olympics.</p>

<h2><strong>How do drone shows work?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s clear up one thing first: drone light shows are <strong>not </strong>powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29">Skynet</a>, the artificial intelligence network depicted in <em>The Terminator</em>! Drones used in shows are not self-aware, can’t think for themselves, and make no real-time decisions. Instead, like obedient servants, they follow specific commands sent to them and can’t deviate!</p>



<p>The process for creating a show is quite straightforward. First, the design team creates a storyboard timeline showing the desired images and effects. These looks are then animated in a specialized piece of software that translates them into synchronized flight paths for each drone, and usually a soundtrack is created to accompany the show. Complete shows are sent to the drones via radio signal from a ground control station operated by a pilot. When the pilot is satisfied that everything is safe and ready to go, the show starts, and the drones take off to draw the storyboard in the sky.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="638" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2.jpg" alt="verge aero flying a drone light show in Mazatlan for Carnaval de Mazatlan" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2.jpg 960w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"><figcaption>Verge Aero flies a show in Mazatlan for Carnaval 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Creating a system that can be flown safely and repeatedly requires a lot of clever engineering work. Verge Aero’s drones and software were designed by our engineers specifically for performing shows. Our custom drones are missing some things normally found on drones, like cameras, and include unique features, such as a blindingly bright LED light source.</p>



<p>Verge Aero’s design software lets users select graphics and special effects and place them in a timeline, similar to those found in video editing software. This software calculates the flight paths of each drone to guarantee they don’t collide in the air, and generates a full 3D rendering of the show to ensure it looks exactly as intended. Every drone is sent a unique program and the ground control station monitors each drone over a local, encrypted network for maximum safety.</p>



<p>The flight crew uses a detailed dashboard display on the ground station to prepare drones for flight and continuously monitor status. The drones themselves carry multiple radios operating simultaneously, away from busy WiFi frequencies, to ensure communications are maintained even in busy and noisy radio environments.</p>



<p>Shows are flown by certified pilots, experts in relevant aviation subject matter, including regulations and weather. Prior to every show, checklists are used to make sure everything is in order: drones are fully operational, batteries are charged, and the flight area is clear. Once these checks are complete, the pilot presses <strong>GO</strong> and the drones take off on their mission!</p>

<h2><strong>Will drones replace fireworks?</strong></h2>



<p>Fireworks shows are increasingly criticized for their negative environmental impact—they are noisy, polluting, and wasteful. Concerns are regularly raised around their impact on sensitive wildlife populations, as well as military veterans experiencing PTSD. What’s more, in many locations, fireworks displays have been banned altogether, due to the increased risk of wildfires.</p>



<p>These and other factors have led many people to consider replacing fireworks displays with alternatives—and drone light shows are perfectly positioned to fill the gap.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ.jpeg" alt="Philadelphia Drone Light Show Stethoscope" width="286" height="391" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ.jpeg 1000w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ-220x300.jpeg 220w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ-768x1049.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px"><figcaption>Verge Aero flies a stethoscope for frontline workers at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In many cases, drone shows have been used successfully as a great complement to fireworks displays. However, as a new and exciting form of entertainment, drones have much more to offer. They are capable of a far greater range of effects than fireworks, and their capacity for sophisticated choreography gives them vastly more potential for storytelling in the sky. Drones can also be deployed in more constrained environments where fireworks would never be allowed.</p>



<p>When you think about it, fireworks actually have quite a limited repertoire. Usually, a handful of effects are repeated over and over again, just in varying combinations, sizes, colors and intensities. Why settle for this when you can have dynamic, repositionable 3D pixels capable of generating virtually unlimited imagery? Drones offer far more creative options than fireworks. In fact, it’s easy to envision that as drone shows become more commonplace, people will one day look back on fireworks displays as being quite mundane in comparison.</p>



<p>Regardless, the transition from fireworks to drones will happen gradually. Fireworks shows will be with us for some time to come, if for no other reason than that they are fairly inexpensive to stage. But as drone shows become more affordable, we can expect to see events using them more frequently.</p>



<h2><strong>Why haven’t I seen more shows?</strong></h2>



<p>Even Wal-Mart now sells drones, so why aren’t we seeing more light shows? The problem is that successful show execution requires different technologies that are only now maturing. Innovations usually take time to disseminate, and drone shows are no different. A number of factors have limited the uptake of drone shows before now:</p>



<ul><li>High cost</li><li>Need for regulatory approval</li><li>Expensive and limited insurance options</li><li>Labor intensive operations</li><li>Lack of efficient show design tools</li><li>Safety requirements</li></ul>



<p>The use of specialized drones with high-precision avionics drives high cost. Labor intensive operations also contribute, whether it’s wrangling rudimentary control software or preparing finicky drones for flight.</p>



<p>High operating expenses are possibly acceptable for the Super Bowl or the Olympics, but are not viable for most events. Nonetheless, things are changing, and Verge Aero’s innovations are helping to make drone light shows more accessible to a far wider range of budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1400" height="399" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA.jpeg" alt="Verge Aero X1 drones ready for flight" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA.jpeg 1400w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA-300x86.jpeg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA-768x219.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"><figcaption>Verge Aero X1 drones ready for flight</figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>How much do drone light shows cost?</strong></h2>



<p>Like many new technologies, drone light shows were extremely expensive at first, and they’re still more expensive than desired. But as with computers and flat panel TVs, prices are decreasing over time. Drone light shows will go mainstream as the technology matures. The tools developed by Verge Aero already make it possible to do more for less!</p>



<p>The main driver of cost is the number of drones being flown. It clearly costs a lot more to put on a 500-drone show than a 50-drone show. In addition to the drones themselves, labor, freight, and logistics all add expense.</p>



<p>A small show that’s easy to deploy costs as little as $20,000. But larger and more complicated shows can easily cost many times this number. Here’s a list of factors that impact price:</p>



<ul><li>Drone quantity</li><li>Show design complexity</li><li>Show coordination and rehearsal time</li><li>Airspace authorization and regulatory compliance</li><li>Shipping and logistics</li><li>Crew travel and accommodation</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What is Verge Aero doing differently?</strong></h2>



<p>To make drone shows more affordable, we introduced a few innovations to streamline the process and reduce the amount of work required.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="550" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550.jpg" alt="drone swarm for PNAU All of Us" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550.jpg 1200w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550-300x138.jpg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550-768x352.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Drones swarming for PNAU’s music video All of Us</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Simplified Show Design</h3>



<p>Historically, drone light shows were manually created using a series of applications including animation software like<a href="https://www.blender.org/"> Blender</a>—which was an extremely tedious and limiting process. Even worse, the programmer had to check that vertices in Blender <strong>never </strong>overlapped during animation, because that would mean drones colliding in the air. The output then needed to be transferred to at least one more program to prepare for flight. All this is an extremely unsafe process because it’s prone to human error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A far better way is to use a unified software application with an easy-to-use interface, like the Verge Aero Design Studio, which automatically handles the anti-collision calculations. Cues are created in the built-in animation software and easily manipulated. Once the design process is complete, the software removes the possibility of human error by deconflicting flight paths, identifying potential issues or mistakes in the show design, and simulating the performance via a rendering pipeline—all without any human intervention.</p>



<p>This software allows designers to generate content with a few key presses, instead of through the laborious processes of using animation tools or writing code. Effects such as complex flocking, as seen in this<a href="https://youtu.be/7DQ4covPEyE"> All of Us music video by PNAU</a>, are automatically created by an effects generator in the Verge Aero Design Studio. Effects created by one designer can easily be …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The debate on the impact telework has on employee productivity &amp; morale is one that has slowly aged with the improvement of technology, but never so important to discuss than in the current global pandemic state the world is faced with.</p><p>For decades the working class has enjoyed, and even thrived in the conventional 9-to-5 office workday with very little contention. In fact, most of the well-known productivity techniques are centered around the premise that employees can only maximize team cohesion &amp; communication when working in a controlled work environment like the office.</p><p>But with the rise of the digital age and need to travel, the world has started to realize the value and need for remote work and set in place internal measures to promote alternative work methods that benefit the workforce.<br>
&nbsp;</p><h2>Reimagining the 9-to-5 workday could improve productivity</h2><p>The contemporary 9-to-5, eight-hour workday was imagined by American labor unions in the 1800s and normalized by Henry Ford in the 1920s. Most employees today simply accept this narrative because it’s what they have gotten so acquainted with. But despite the growing popularity in the demand for remote and flexible work, the need for a change in work culture has been met with much skepticism from managers. A recent study conducted by Remote Workplace Study explores the prime obstacles to implementing a flexible workplace policy:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Company’s long-standing resistance to change &nbsp;</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Lack of understanding about the benefits of remote work</li><li>Fear of how it will impact the overall company culture</li><li>Technology requirements</li><li>Data security</li></ul><p>Understandably, managers have reservations about changing traditional work culture. Most concerns center around losing control of assessing team cohesiveness and potential reduction in employee productivity &amp; focus. But despite this, change is inevitable. In fact, most studies confirm an increase in productivity, working “smarter” and willingness to work over-time when employees are given the flexibility to choose when and how to work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Millennials are driving the demand for flexible and remote work&nbsp;</h2><p>As of today, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) account for almost 50% of the global workforce and are expected to grow to 75% by 2025. This means that the need for companies to adopt flexible and remote work policies is more compelling today than ever before in order to attract and retain a younger, skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p><h2>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</h2><p>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</p><h3>For Companies</h3><ul><li>Cost savings (office &amp; overhead costs)</li><li>Increase in productivity</li><li>Employee retention &amp; reduced turnover</li><li>Profitability (companies save avg. $11, 000 &nbsp;per part-time telecommuter)</li><li>Environmental benefits (less commuting to work reduces carbon footprint)</li><li>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</li></ul><h3>For Employees</h3><ul><li>Improved work-life balance</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>No commute (time and cost savings)</li><li>Location independence (work from home/travel while working)</li><li>More time to spend with family</li><li>Expense savings (transportation, gas, &amp; freedom &nbsp;to live in low-cost cities) &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>The world’s largest firms have endorsed remote working policies in the wake of Covid19</h2><p>It’s no secret that the novel Coronavirus pandemic has played an integral role in the sudden surge of remote work policies implemented across companies worldwide. Big corporations such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon, &amp; Microsoft have adopted such changes with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announcing that his employees can work remotely indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“... the work-from-home revolution is shaping the future of the workplace.”</p></blockquote><p>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</p><p>In closing, albeit reservations from conservative and outdated work practices, the future of the work environment is remote and flexible work. In the age of the internet, connecting with skilled professionals has become easier and accessible. Thanks to online professional platforms like remoteworkers.net, companies have access to a wider pool of highly experienced talent and job-seekers can find their ideal remote jobs. Companies would be wise to evolve with the growth in remote work trends in order to become more competitive &amp; improve productivity.</p><h2>Looking for a remote job?</h2><p>Thanks to the internet, connecting skilled professionals with remote-friendly companies has never been easier.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h4>Why Ray is poised to play a central role in future serverless offerings</h4><p>The history of computing infrastructure is one of steady improvements over extended periods. Cloud computing brought several capabilities that we now take for granted including the elimination of upfront investments in hardware, the ability to pay for compute resources on an as-needed basis, and elasticity. The move to the cloud has <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3512885/enterprises-now-spend-more-on-cloud-infrastructure-services-than-on-premises-data-center-gear.html"><u>accelerated in recent years</u></a> and many companies now use a mix of on-premise infrastructure alongside <a href="https://gradientflow.com/one-simple-chart-most-companies-use-multiple-cloud-providers/"><u>multiple cloud providers</u></a>.</p><p>In 2015, AWS introduced Lambda, a service that offered <i>cloud functions</i> and introduced the concept of <i>serverless computing</i>. Serverless and cloud functions differ from traditional cloud computing in two critical ways: (1) serverless abstracts away infrastructure (scaling, provisioning servers) freeing developers to focus on writing programs, (2) serverless provides finer-grained increments for billing (sub-second, compared to traditional cloud computing which uses minutes).</p><p>Since the introduction of AWS Lambda, interest in serverless and cloud functions <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1597100400?hl=en-US&amp;tz=420&amp;date=2015-01-01+2020-08-10&amp;geo=US&amp;q=serverless&amp;sni=3"><u>has grown</u></a> and all major cloud providers now have similar offerings. <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-3.pdf"><u>Experts predict</u></a> that serverless will continue to grow in importance and more applications will use serverless computing platforms in the years ahead. But we are still in the early stages of serverless computing. A widely read&nbsp; 2019 paper (<a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-3.pdf"><u>“A Berkeley View on Serverless Computing”</u></a>) described&nbsp; “challenges and research opportunities that need to be addressed for serverless computing to fulfill its promise”.</p><p>In this post we examine some limitations of current cloud functions (also referred to as <i>FaaS</i> or <i>serverless</i>). We note that the distributed computing framework <a href="https://github.com/ray-project/ray"><u>Ray</u></a> addresses many of these challenges and argue that Ray is the right foundation for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMXTpdJSuk"><u>general purpose serverless framework</u></a>.</p><h2>Serverless: Special Purpose vs General Purpose</h2><p>There have been multiple efforts to expand the scope of serverless. Projects like <a href="http://ex.camera/nsdi17/"><u>ExCamera</u></a>, <a href="http://pywren.io/"><u>PyWren</u></a>, <a href="https://www.serverless.com/blog/using-tensorflow-serverless-framework-deep-learning-image-recognition"><u>TF-on-serverless</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.qubole.com/blog/spark-on-aws-lambda/"><u>Spark-on-Lambda</u></a> try to run more complex workloads on FaaS platforms like Lambda. Several industry platforms provide serverless-like capabilities and user experiences, including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/"><u>Amazon Aurora</u></a>, <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2017/06/07/databricks-serverless-next-generation-resource-management-for-apache-spark.html"><u>Databricks</u></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/serverless/whitepaper"><u>BigQuery</u></a>, and others. However, these offerings generally target <i>specific workloads</i> and do not aim to run arbitrary applications. We define the characteristics of such a framework (Ray) in the following table, along with key tradeoffs:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/xjan103pcp94/5bhF7EF9VdFyQtqqqgvz45/c446dcf421ea3c288a6dd087ddba469b/blog_grid.png" alt="blog table"></p></div></div><h2>Why Ray for General Purpose Serverless?</h2><p><b>Ray hides servers</b></p><p>Like existing FaaS platforms, Ray abstracts away servers from the applications. With version 1.0, users do not need to specify the cluster size or the type of instances when launching an application. Instead, they only need to provide Ray with the set of available resources (e.g., a list of instance types in AWS or a list of nodes and their capabilities in an on-prem cluster) and Ray will automatically pick the instance types and dynamically scale up and down to match the application demands.</p><p><b>Ray supports stateful applications</b></p><p>Serverless platforms scale and provision storage and compute separately, thus computations on serverless platforms are stateless. Cloud functions do not store previous transactions or knowledge. The typical flow is to run a computation (a function call), write results to a storage service, and if needed, another function can take that output and use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Fundamental_concepts"><u>Actor model</u></a> is a powerful programming paradigm that focuses on the semantics of message passing, and works seamlessly when local or remote. Ray supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model"><u>actors</u></a>, which are stateful workers (or services). Having a serverless platform that can support stateful computations dramatically increases the number of possible applications. Stateful operators allow Ray to efficiently support streaming computations, <a href="https://anyscale.com/blog/heres-what-you-need-to-look-for-in-a-model-server-to-build-ml-powered-services"><u>machine learning model serving</u></a>, and web applications. In fact there are already companies who use Ray in applications that combine both streaming and machine learning. For example, Ant Group “built a multi-paradigm fusion engine on top of Ray that combines streaming, graph processing, and machine learning in a single system to perform real-time fraud detection and online promotion.”</p><p><b>Ray supports direct communication between tasks</b></p><p>Almost every distributed application, such as streaming or data processing, exchanges data between tasks. Unfortunately, existing serverless platforms do not allow direct communication between functions. The only way two functions can communicate with each other is via a cloud storage system like S3. Unfortunately, this is slow and expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Ray enables arbitrary tasks and actors to communicate with each other. This enables applications to efficiently exchange data and implement arbitrary communication patterns.</p><p><b>Ray lets developers access hardware accelerators</b></p><p>Developers know what type of hardware resources best serve their applications so giving them the ability to control resources is an important feature of any compute platform. FaaS services currently let developers specify execution time limits and memory sizes. But in some applications - notably machine learning model training - developers need to access specific accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, etc.). At this time FaaS providers do not offer this level of control over resources.&nbsp;</p><p>A serverless platform built on top of Ray would have no limitations in terms of specifying resources. Developers who use Ray can already describe the hardware resources they need (number of CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and other hardware accelerators). Future versions of Ray will even allow developers to specify the precise type of chip they prefer (e.g., “two V100 GPUs”).</p><p><b>Ray provides an open source API</b></p><p>There is no “standard API” for writing serverless applications. We believe that Ray is a strong candidate for such an open, serverless API. Ray allows developers to write general programs, not just functions. It combines support for both stateless and stateful applications and access to widely used programming languages (Python and Java, with more to follow). In fact, Ray is usually described as a distributed computing platform that can be used to scale applications with minimal effort.</p><p><br><b>Ray supports fine-grained coordination and control, which can lead to better performance</b></p><p>There are many applications where control over data locality and scheduling are critical. This includes the broad range of applications that need to distribute and share data across compute nodes. Current serverless offerings are a poor fit for this class of applications. For example, a developer who uses serverless to perform a gradient computation in machine learning will not have control over where data and cloud functions are located. Another example comes from reinforcement learning, where developers will want to use the same compute node for training policies and performing rollouts.</p><p>Ray overcomes these limitations by providing data locality and scheduling control. A developer who uses Ray can specify which actors should run on the same machine.</p><p><br><b>Ray has no runtime limits</b></p><p>Current offerings (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/10/aws-lambda-supports-functions-that-can-run-up-to-15-minutes/"><u>Lambda</u></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec#:~:text=Function%20execution%20time%20is%20limited,period%20up%20to%209%20minutes."><u>Cloud Functions</u></a>, <a href="https://build5nines.com/azure-functions-extend-execution-timeout-past-5-minutes/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20benefits,originally%20set%20to%205%20minutes."><u>Azure Functions</u></a>) have execution times that are capped at around 15 minutes or less. This limits the types of applications that a FaaS platform can support. In contrast, since Ray runs on top of existing clouds or clusters, there are no time limits.</p><h2>But what about costs?</h2><p>One of the most popular aspects of serverless is that users are billed based on usage. Serverless platforms use accounting units that are measured in milliseconds, compared to traditional cloud computing which uses minutes.</p><p>Since cloud providers charge at the level of an instance, as a software layer, (open source) Ray by itself cannot instantiate and release compute resources quickly enough to deliver fine-grained accounting units. For example, if you have an actor running on a server with 32 cores (and you only have one actor running on it), your cloud provider will likely charge you for 32 cores. Ray does not address this discrepancy between utilization and cost. Getting to fine-grained accounting units would require that you build <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/product"><u>a serverless platform on top of Ray</u></a>.</p><p>With that said, Ray can automatically allocate new instances and shutdown existing instances in minutes. Thus, Ray can already provide serverless functionality for coarse grained jobs that run for say 30 minutes. Examples that might fall under the realm of coarse grained jobs include&nbsp; streaming, model training, and model serving jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Ray also has the potential to provide substantial cost savings for coarse-grain workloads. The cost of using cloud functions can be 4x-5x higher than a cloud computing instance operating at 100% utilization. Indeed, at the time of writing, a 3GB RAM AWS Lambda <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/"><u>costs $0.0000048958 per 100ms</u></a> or $0.1762488/hour. In comparison, a t3.medium instance with 4GB RAM <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/"><u>costs just $0.0416/hour</u></a> which is 4.2x cheaper, and when considering per GB RAM pricing, it is 5.65x cheaper. This is an underestimate because it does not include the per-request costs.</p><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><p>As far back as 2016, <a href="https://youtu.be/wYCLbLrEoqs?t=95"><u>experts were already noting</u></a> how serverless tools enable teams to quickly build extremely functional and scalable applications. Since then a growing number of developers are turning to serverless technologies to build applications. But for serverless to live up to its promise, current offerings (cloud functions) need to address the limitations listed in this post.</p><p>Companies are still in the early stages of exploring serverless technologies. We believe that Ray is the ideal foundation for a general purpose serverless framework. With the rise of AI and other data intensive applications, Ray is poised to play a central role in future serverless offerings.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>In his 2014 <em>Safety I and Safety II: The past and future of safety management</em>, Erik Hollnagel makes the argument that we should not (just) try to stop things from going wrong. Instead, we need to understand why most things go right, and then ensure that as much as possible indeed goes right. It seems so obvious. Yet it is light years away from how most organizations ‘do’ safety today, with their focus on low numbers of lagging indicators, incidents and injuries.</p>
<p>That said, many organizations have now begun to recognize the severe organizational deficiencies, cultural problems and ethical headaches that lag indicators create for them. Most will be familiar with the following sorts of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers games and the hiding or renaming of injuries and incidents;</li>
<li>Counterproductive and credibility-straining sloganeering (‘Zero Harm!’);</li>
<li>Short-termism (driven by quarterly figures);</li>
<li>Creative case management and a lack of compassion for those who do get hurt in the course of work (think of the cynical use of ‘suitable duties’ to keep someone off the injury stats or lost time books);</li>
<li>The misdirection of accountability through sanctioning, dismissal or exclusion of those who have been hurt in the past (just cancel the contractor’s access card, for instance);</li>
<li>The statistical insignificance of any change in typical lagging indicators (‘We went from 3 lost time injuries last year to 1 this year! And we worked a total of 5 million person-hours!’ …<em>Uhmm, right</em>);</li>

<li>Worker cynicism, mistrust and disenchantment;</li>

<p>Erik’s insight is the hinge on which the transition to Safety Differently turns. Let’s not stare ourselves silly at the lowest possible injury and incident numbers, with the ridiculous and counterproductive Siren Song of ‘Zero Harm’ (See Sheratt &amp; Dainty, 2017, for how ‘Zero’ is linked to more fatalities and serious injuries)as the ultimate paradise we want to reach. Deming said it long before anybody in the Resilience community said it: get rid of targets, slogans and exhortations. They get in the way of allowing your people to produce quality work (Deming, 1982). So instead, let’s learn why things go right and find out what we can do to make it even more so. Safety is not about the <em>absence&nbsp;</em>of negatives; it is about the <em>presence&nbsp;</em>of capacities. The field of Resilience Engineering, formally founded at a meeting in Söderköping in Sweden over a decade ago (Dekker, 2006)was of course driven by this logic. I witnessed Erik and others forcefully making this very point, from many different angles, for a week in a room full of peers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>One way to illustrate this point, as Erik indeed does (and others now do as well) is by way of a Gaussian, or normal curve. The curve shows that the number of the things that go wrong (the left side of the curve) is tiny. On the right side of the curve are the heroic, unexpected surprises (a Hudson River landing, for instance) that fall far outside what people would normally experience or have to deal with. In between, the huge bulbous middle of the figure, sits the quotidian or daily creation of success. This is where good outcomes are made, despite the organizational, operational and financial obstacles, despite the rules, the bureaucracy, the common frustrations and obstacles. This is where work can be hard, but is still successful. The way to make even further progress on safety, suggests this figure, is not by trying to make the red part of things that go wrong even smaller, but by understanding what accounts for the big middle part where things go right. And then enhancing the capacities that make it so. That way, we don’t make the red part smaller by making the red part smaller. We make the red part smaller by making the white part bigger. Research by René Amalberti tells us that it is indeed likely that this is <em>the&nbsp;</em>way to make progress on safety in already safe systems (Amalberti, 2001, 2006, 2013). In those systems, we have milked the recipes for how to prevent things from going wrong to the maximum already. We have many layers of protection in place. We have rules to the point of overregulation. We monitor, record, investigate and standardize the designs people work with. Ever more things targeted at the red part are not going to make it any smaller. The complexity of the system won’t let us. And in fact, the more we do to make that part smaller with what we already know (more rules, more limits on people, more technology and barriers) may in fact contribute to novel pathways to breakdown, accidents and failures (Dekker, 2011).</p>

We make the red part smaller by making the white part bigger: focusing on why things go right and enhancing the capacities that make it so. Figure by Kelvin Genn.</p></div>
<p><em>Shifting the paradigm</em></p>
<p>The question that most organizations yearn to have answered, though, is this: what is going to take the place of their long-held and easily communicated total recordable injury frequency rate? As Thomas Kuhn (1970)pointed out, people are unwilling to relinquish a paradigm—despite all its faults—if there is no plausible, viable alternative to take its place.</p>
<p>A few years back, I was working, together with some students, with a large health authority which employed some 25,000 people. The patient safety statistics were dire, if typical: one in thirteen of the patients who walked (or were carried) through the doors to receive care were hurt in the process of receiving that care. 1 in 13, or 7%. These numbers weren’t unique, of course. They were also problematic. Because what exactly is ‘nosocomial harm,’ harm that originates in a hospital? What is ‘medical error’ and when is it putatively responsible for the adverse event that happened to the patient? Indeed, when exactly does the patient become that ‘one’ out of thirteen? These are important (and huge) epistemological and ontological questions. I have vociferously commented on them before (and I didn’t exactly make friends in the field, for example by claiming how safe gun owners are in comparison to doctors) (Dekker, 2007).</p>
<p>But it’s not the point here. When we asked the health authority what they typically found in the one case that went wrong—the one that turned into an ‘adverse event,’ the one that inflicted harm on the patient—here is what they came up with. After all, they had plenty of data to go on: one out of thirteen in a large healthcare system can add up to a sizable number of patients per day. So in the patterns that all this data yielded, they consistently found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workarounds</li>
<li>Shortcuts</li>
<li>Violations</li>
<li>Guidelines not followed</li>
<li>Errors and miscalculations</li>
<li>Unfindable people or medical instruments</li>
<li>Unreliable measurements</li>
<li>User-unfriendly technologies</li>
<li>Organizational frustrations</li>
<li>Supervisory shortcomings</li>
</ul>
<p>It seemed a pretty intuitive and straightforward list. It was also a list that firmly belonged to a particular era in our evolving understanding of safety: that of the person as the weakest link, of the ‘human factor’ as a set of mental and moral deficiencies that only great systems and stringent supervision can meaningfully guard against. In that sort of logic, we’ve got great systems and solid procedures—it’s just those people who are unreliable or non-compliant:</p>
<ul>
<li>People are the problem to control</li>
<li>We need to find out what people did wrong</li>
<li>We write or enforce more rules</li>
<li>We tell everyone to try harder</li>
<li>We get rid of bad apples</li>
</ul>
<p>Many organizational strategies, to the extent that you can call them that, were indeed organized around these very premises. Poster campaigns that reminded people of particular risks they needed to be aware of, for instance. Or strict surveillance and compliance monitoring with respect to certain ‘zero-tolerance’ or ‘red-rule’ activities (e.g. hand hygiene, drug administration protocols). Or a ‘just culture’ process that got those lower on the medical competence hierarchy more frequently ‘just-cultured’ (code for suspended, demoted, dismissed, fired) than those with more power in the system. Or some miserably measly attention to supervisor leadership training.</p>
<p>We were of course interested to know the extent to which these investments in reducing the ‘one in thirteen’ had paid off. They hadn’t. The health authority was still stuck at one in thirteen.</p>
<p><em>What would Erik do?</em></p>
<p>This is when we asked the Erik Hollnagel question. We asked: “What about the other twelve? Do you even know why they go right? Have you ever asked yourself that question?” The answer we got was “no.” All the resources that the health authority had were directed toward investigating and understanding the ones that went wrong. There was organizational, reputational and political pressure to do so, for sure. And the resources to investigate the instances of harm were too meager to begin with. So this is all they could do. We then offered to do it for them. And so, in an acutely unscientific but highly opportunistic way, we spent time in the hospitals of the authority to find out what happened when things went well, when there was no evidence of adverse events or patient harm.</p>
<p>When we got back together after a period of weeks, we compared notes. At first we couldn’t believe it, thinking that what we had found was just a fluke, an irregular and rare irritant in data that should otherwise have been telling us something quite different. But it turned out that everybody had found that in the twelve cases that go right, that don’t result in an adverse event or patient harm, there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workarounds</li>
<li>Shortcuts</li>
<li>Violations</li>
<li>Guidelines not followed</li>
<li>Errors and miscalculations</li>
<li>Unfindable people or medical instruments</li>
<li>Unreliable measurements</li>
<li>User-unfriendly technologies</li>
<li>Organizational frustrations</li>
<li>Supervisory …</li></ul></div></div>
