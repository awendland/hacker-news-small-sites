<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>P</span>eople afflicted by Covid-19, particularly those with bad cases, experience difficulty breathing.&nbsp; We need oxygen in our tissues to keep our bodies working and our brains clear; viral damage to our lungs deprives bodies of this vital dissolved gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>	This oxygen-starved condition is called hypoxia, and itâ€™s also a serious condition in many parts of the worldâ€™s ocean, as well as in estuaries, lagoons, rivers, and lakes. Marine hypoxia receives much less public attention than ocean acidification or warming—but in many parts of the world its effects may be just as profound, and the problem is worsening.</p>
<p>	The causes of marine hypoxia are twofold. The first, which has been studied the most, is the too-much-of-a-good-thing problem of nutrient over-enrichment. Vast loads of nutrients are applied to farm fields as fertilizers, spill from our sewage and septic systems, and waft from the tailpipes of automobiles. Inevitably some of these make their way into water, stimulating blooms of tiny plankton that eventually die and decay.&nbsp;The process of decaying consumes the oxygen, and hypoxia ensues. Wastewater treatment plants have helped but are not enough. Some nutrient-loaded hypoxic waters are now-infamous â€œdead zones,â€� such as the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie most summers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The other major cause is global warming.&nbsp;Warmer water canâ€™t hold as much dissolved oxygen as colder water. Itâ€™s lighter, too, and therefore tends to float above cooler layers, cutting them off from atmospheric exchange so that they eventually become deoxygenated as well. This phenomenon isnâ€™t directly associated with nutrient over-enrichment, but can exacerbate and intensify dead zones and impact deep ocean waters that have few nutrients. Warming is a global problem affecting the oxygen status of all waters—and it also fuels blooms of algae that die and decay, again setting off the cycle of oxygen loss.</p>
<p>	The general public—and even many scientists—are unaware of the rapidly expanding scale of deoxygenation. Among the first researchers to describe it were marine ecologists Bob Diaz and Rutger Rosenberg, who in the 1980s began to study the impacts on bottom-dwelling organisms in estuaries and coastal seas. In 1995 they wrote, "There is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period as dissolved oxygen." &nbsp;</p>
<p>	In 2008, Diaz and Rosenberg published a landmark study in the journal <em>Science</em>, documenting over 400 such zones and showing that their growth was exponential.&nbsp;By 2019 their tally exceeded 700, and possibly as many as 1000, coastal dead zones.&nbsp;If we make a chart of the known history of increase and color-code it by Gross World Product, an index of global economic output, we can appreciate the linkage of these dead zones to human activity:</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_423219c2026b77bfba722aa122b966a6.jpg" alt="dead zones and GWP chart"><figcaption><span>Growth in the number of coastal marine ecosystems classified as â€œdead zonesâ€� by Diaz and Rosenberg (2008) and Diaz et al. (2019).  The colors indicate levels of Gross World Product (GWP), and show that as economic output has increased exponentially, so has the number of polluted, deoxygenated dead zones. </span><br><span>GWP data: World Bank and CIA Factbook (compiled in Wikipedia).</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation in open oceans, away from coasts, extends farther and deeper, and is largely caused by the aforementioned tendency of warm water to seal off the cool waters below. The extent and spread of these so-called oxygen minimum zones wasnâ€™t fully appreciated until around 15 years ago, when improved instrumentation allowed scientists to measure them.&nbsp;Ten years ago their total area was estimated at 8 percent of Earth's ocean surface area—11.7 million square miles altogether, an area larger than North America and comparable in size to the entire African continent. That area is expanding today.<br></p>
<p>Brief periods of hypoxia—or even no oxygen, a phenomenon called anoxia—are common in nature and many organisms adapt by moving away or going temporarily dormant.&nbsp;A very few species are exceptionally tolerant and even have specialized metabolic pathways to cope in these circumstances.&nbsp;As the scale of deoxygenation increases, however, we see low-oxygen events so large and long that even highly mobile organisms, like fish, canâ€™t always escape.&nbsp;Some may be able to survive but become so weak that they have difficulty moving and finding food, let alone digesting it.&nbsp;Think of the Covid-19 sufferers who are so exhausted from lack of oxygen that they can barely move.&nbsp;Itâ€™s the same basic issue.&nbsp;As scientists study the problem of marine deoxygenation, we are increasingly seeing the effects on everything from fish growth to reproductive impairment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although most of the studies on biotic effects of deoxygenation have taken place in laboratories, my colleague Ben Walther and I, together with our students and colleagues, have learned to decipher signs of hypoxia exposure that are â€œrecordedâ€� in tiny bones within fish heads, called otoliths or ear-stones.&nbsp;These calcium carbonate deposits grow incrementally and take up various trace elements including the element manganese, which becomes available only at very low oxygen concentrations.&nbsp;By studying the lifetime uptake of manganese, biologist Michele Casini and I showed that periods of intense hypoxia have profound impacts on the growth and health of Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea. With less oxygen available, cod have less energy for foraging and fighting off parasites and infections. As a result, they are unhealthy and shrunken compared to cod living in better environments. By age three, cod with high levels of hypoxia exposure are one-third smaller than healthy cod from oxygen-rich waters. Multiply that by population size and you have an epic loss of biomass. This has direct economic consequences and likely causes enormous suffering for the fish themselves.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_15b7f377d5e469878f05995df3610167.jpg" alt="Cod before-and-after"><figcaption><span>Left: Cod caught in 1981 off the island of Gotland, Sweden. Right: Cod caught in 2020 in the same vicinity. Baltic cod today are affected by several stressors, foremost among them hypoxia. </span><br><span>K. Limburg and Y. Heimbrand</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation impacts ripple through entire ecosystems, too.&nbsp;Recent work has shown that in large stretches of the ocean even zooplankton, the microscopic animals who feed fish, often live on the edge of metabolic collapse. A study in the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone found that zooplankton there migrate in and out of microhabitats with extremely low oxygen; they are among the most hypoxia-tolerant organisms, yet are already at their metabolic limits. Projected further declines in oxygen may put them over the edge, with important consequences for carbon cycling and other biogeochemical processes in the open ocean.&nbsp;Food webs become compromised, particularly those on sea bottoms; there are many documented cases of sensitive invertebrate communities falling victim to hypoxic events since they cannot flee. Hypoxia has even been found to cause mass mortality in coral reef ecosystems, and in some instances may play as important a role as the better-known culprit of elevated water temperatures. Even open-water ecosystems change as the volume of healthy habitat shrinks and species crowd together, leading to novel food-web interactions. Covid-19â€™s web of long-term complications presents an uncanny parallel.<br></p>
<p>	Fortunately for humanity, a vaccine for Covid-19 should be available in 2021.&nbsp;The outlook for the oceans is not so optimistic, but neither is it hopeless.&nbsp;Think about the initial response to the virus, which was hamstrung by shortages of necessary medical supplies and technology, including masks and respirators; once the issues were recognized, it became possible to prioritize production to deal with the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of coastal hypoxia, nutrient pollution reductions coupled with wetland and seagrass restoration are akin to masks and respirators. They help protect the ecosystems and build up their resiliency. Those approaches resulted in greatly improved water quality and subsequent return of biodiversity in the waters off Tampa Bay, Florida, for example. And after decades of nutrient management, some parts of the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay are beginning to show signs of recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The looming, elephant-in-the-room challenge is to deal with global warming, which will require new economic policies at national and global scales and the commitment of governments and citizens everywhere. Although overshadowed in the news cycle by Covid-19, global warming is still on the rise, fueled by human outputs of greenhouse gases.&nbsp;We <em>must</em> bend the curve on greenhouse gas emissions, just as we must flatten the Covid-19 curve. Without such change, we are headed in a dark, scary direction where nobody really wants to go.</p>

                    <p>85% of the data consumed over the internet is via videos. About 2.8 exabytes of data is transferred over the internet via streaming videos. This growth is driven by the advent of VOD platforms like Netflix, Video communication platforms like Zoom, Social platforms like Tiktok, esports, live streaming to name a few.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG_1.png 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG_2.png 1000w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG 1135w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source :- https://www.peervadoo.com/</figcaption></figure><p>Covid19 pandemic has accelerated the video consumption and has been the driving force of companies moving from offline mode to online live mode. With this explosion of the video consumption on a day-to-day basis we need to be prepared for the upcoming demand. </p><p>In this article we will be discussing what are the latest advancements in video streaming technology and how can they help in improving the streaming experience.</p><h2 id="p2p-streaming"><a href="https://www.peervadoo.com/">P2P Streaming</a> &nbsp;</h2><p>Video streaming follows a client-server model. The content is delivered from edge locations called CDN which cache the content from the server. The client devices i.e the mobile/laptop/TV fetch the content from these CDN to start playing your video. Video streaming via CDN has a few limitations as mentioned below</p><ol><li>Video streaming using CDN is expensive</li><li>Viewership spike leads to high buffering</li><li>Delivery of content to remote locations due to poor coverage of CDN</li></ol><p>Due to these reasons it becomes difficult for a video streaming company to scale their service effectively and to provide a good user experience. All of these problems can be solved by extending a CDN with P2P streaming aka Hybrid CDN</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/Server-based-vs-P2P-network.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/Server-based-vs-P2P-network_1.jpg 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/Server-based-vs-P2P-network.jpg 601w"><figcaption>Source :- <a href="https://www.wowza.com/resources/guides/p2p-unicast-streaming">https://www.wowza.com/resources/guides/p2p-unicast-streaming</a></figcaption></figure><p>Adding <a href="https://www.peervadoo.com/">Peer-to-Peer</a> layer over the traditional CDN reduces the load on the main CDN by distributing the content from neighboring peers which act like a CDN themselves thus bringing the edge much closer to the user. Due to less load on CDN, the expenses will now be 40% less while the user experience improves as well due to low re-buffering as the content is fetched from a nearby peer than a far-away CDN. More info about how the technology works is available <a href="https://blog.peervadoo.com/what-is-vadoo.html">here</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->







<p><a href="https://www.peervadoo.com/?ref=vadoo_blog">Scale your video streaming with Vadoo</a></p><h2 id="super-resolution">Super-Resolution </h2><p>Artificial Intelligence has been disrupting all kinds of industries and video streaming is no exception. AI models can learn how to generate a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image by learning from a lot of images. This method of generating a high-res image from a low-res image is called Super-Resolution</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/3c7d17d9-68f1-49fa-9a5f-9c5fef10cac9.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/3c7d17d9-68f1-49fa-9a5f-9c5fef10cac9_1.jpeg 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/3c7d17d9-68f1-49fa-9a5f-9c5fef10cac9.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Super-Resolution comes under the realm of generative algorithms where the algorithm has the ability to generate information which is not present before. As can be seen in the above figure, the network can take the image from the left and imagine the finer details to re-create the image on the right. This is possible because the AI models have been trained on lots of data of images and it now has an understanding of how to upscale the image when a new image has been provided. </p><p>The same concept can be extended for videos with minor modifications. In the case of videos, multiple generated high-resolution frames of the past and the current low resolution frame are used together to generate the current high-resolution frame but nevertheless the concept is same. This technology provides the capability to send a video at 480p but to watch on the client device at say 1080p. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm_2.jpg 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm_1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm_3.jpg 1600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source :- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09393.pdf</figcaption></figure><p>This technology is possible due to the recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of huge compute power at client devices. A recent paper <strong>TecoGAN</strong> has produced high-resolution results which are eerily similar to the real-world images as can be seen in image above. Using this technology can save up-to 30% of the bandwidth consumption thus improving the overall user experience.</p><h2 id="multi-cdn"><a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/multi_cdn">Multi-CDN</a></h2><p>We have seen that content is delivered to client devices via CDN which cache the content from the server. A CDN consists of data-centers located at multiple locations to serve content. These locations are called Point-of-Presence(POP). Ideally we would want to have as many POP's as possible. But not all CDN's have equal reach worldwide. For example some of the most popular CDN doesn't even have a single POP in China.</p><p>In addition, the performance of every CDN varies with time and is inconsistent.A CDN can have an outage at any point of time due to Murphy's law. To deal with all these risks, an ideal option would be to have access to multiple CDN at a time. This can either be done by reaching out to multiple CDN and cutting deals with each of them individually or instead reach out to a <a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/multi_cdn">Multi-CDN provider</a> who manages all of this for you.</p><p>Powering your video streaming service using a Multi-CDN provides you with the advantages which help in improving the overall user experience. </p><ol><li>Prevention of sudden stoppage of service by switching to a working CDN</li><li>Fetching content from the highest performing CDN at that point of time using Real User Monitoring(RUM) metrics to improve Quality of Service(QOS)</li><li>Mid-stream switching can help in reducing CDN costs</li></ol><h2 id="cmaf">CMAF</h2><p>Live streaming a sports match would have a delay of 25-30 seconds than a television broadcast thus impeding user experience. This is due to the way the technology around video streaming is designed. The most prominent way of streaming videos is HTTP based streaming, where the video content is delivered in the following steps</p><ol><li>The video is encoded with a codec say h264 to reduce the video file size</li><li>Then the video is converted to a streamable format like HLS or MPEG-DASH</li><li>The content from the server is now distributed via CDN</li><li>The video player buffers few segments of the video before starting to play</li></ol><p>HLS or MPEG-DASH allows sending the videos in segments which are downloaded sequentially by the video player. A segment generally contains around 10 seconds of video. The encoder has to wait for encoding the entire segment of the video before making it available for CDN. The CDN has to wait for receiving the entire segment of video before passing it across to the video player. The video player has to buffer atleast few segments of video before it starts playing to maintain user experience.</p><p>This entire process leads to a delay of 25-30 seconds. Also due to the presence of multiple formats i.e .ts fr HLS and .mp4 of MPEG-DASH there is a need for double the storage, double the encoding and double the CDN. CMAF tries to solve both the above problems.</p><p>CMAF provides a consistent format fragment mp4(fmp4) which is supported by both HLS and MPEG-DASH. It also has the capability of doing chunked transfer encoding. What this means is, the encoder won't be waiting for the entire segment of video before transmitting. The segment is further divided into smaller chunks and these chunks are sent as and when encoded which is passed on by the CDN to encoder in no particular order. The video player takes care of organizing the chunks and playing the video segment.</p><p>Thus CMAF helps in reducing the encoding and storage costs as well as reducing the latency using chunked transfer encoding.</p><h2 id="per-title-encoding">Per-title encoding </h2><p>Video encoding is the process of compressing video using codecs like H.264 which take advantage of common information present across consecutive frames and thus only storing the newly added information in the frame. To deal with a variety of network conditions and volatile internet connections the video content is encoded at multiple resolutions and is intelligently switched. This technique is called Adaptive Bitrate(ABR). &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP_1.png 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP_2.png 1000w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP.png 1216w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The below image depicts multiple resolutions and the corresponding bitrate allocated. The key-factor to observe here is that the content at the same resolution can be encoded at multiple bitrates i.e a 1920 x 1080 video can be encoded at 5800 mbps or 6800 mbps or even 4800 mbps. This is due to the fact that video compression is a lossy compression and hence the lesser the chosen bitrate the lesser the information available in the compressed video. This can be observed in the encoding artifacts similar to the image above which you would have observed while you watch a video on a streaming platform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/1_tCdB8E0X6zDJKAhpTLxNBA.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/1_tCdB8E0X6zDJKAhpTLxNBA_1.png 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/1_tCdB8E0X6zDJKAhpTLxNBA.png 633w"><figcaption>Source :- https://netflixtechblog.com/per-title-encode-optimization-7e99442b62a2</figcaption></figure><p>Now that we know we can encode a video at a particular resolution using different bitrates, in real-world an ideal generic bitrate is chosen such that there would lesser artifacts while not consuming a lot of bandwidth. The above picture shows a generic bandwidth pattern which is chosen for all videos. But there is a problem with this one size fits all approach. Some of the videos such as high octane action films might have rich information and thus might need a higher bitrate for encoding while a simple cartoon video can perform the same even with a lower bitrate.</p><p>Thus Netflix proposed encoding a particular video resolution at multiple bitrates and then choosing the best bitrate which can render the video without artifacts. This is done using a metric called VMAF which is a visual score to identify the quality of rendered video. With the help of this, custom bitrate ladders can be designed for each video. Thus if we are streaming a cartoon video, it can be published at a lower bitrate while still having similar quality whereas the action film can be published at a higher bitrate without any artifacts and thus improving user experience. </p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>To summarize we have seen multiple techniques which can help scaling, improve user experience and reduce latency in video streaming.The advent of 5G and the world of Virtual Reality(VR) and Augmented Reality(AR) and the rise of esports will skyrocket video bandwidth consumption. Thus it is time for the adoption of the latest technologies to catch up and service this growth.</p><h2 id="vadoo-s-p2p-and-multi-cdn-solution">Vadoo's P2P and Multi-CDN solution</h2><p>We at Vadoo are disrupting the video streaming industry using <a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/register?ref=vadoo_blog">hybrid P2P streaming</a> and <a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/multi_cdn?ref=vadoo_blog">Multi-CDN</a>.

  <p>I had been a happy-go Java developer on Windows platform. And then I had to ride the Ruby-on-Rails wave over Linux platform, only to realize how much I didn't know about productivity with automation. Later I moved onto MacOS to experience bliss before starting to hate it for one thing after the other; right from their buggy operating system upgrades to Apple not providing power cable compatible to Indian market resulting in earthing issues. Out of frustration I jumped back to Ubuntu and now back on Windows after long years.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting onto Windows was more out of necessity than interest and I started to explore how much things have changed in the Windows world. It wasn't a smooth return for me but the teething period is over and I'm loving Windows again. If you are onto Windows 10 Pro edition, and wanting to get the best of both worlds (Windows and Linux), this post is for you. I am jotting down ProTips to experience delight and productivity at development work.</p>
<ol><li>Use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1, for the former is far less resource intensive by integrating natively with Windows 10 Hyper-V virtualization stack, and thus phenomenally faster too. If you are on Windows 10 Home edition, you need to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro edition and it is worth it, for you can get it at half the price upon upgrade.</li><li>Do not mount windows native formatted drive (NTFS) onto WSL for code that can be developed both in WSL environment and Windows. While this works, it is snail paced and you will frustrated too soon. I tried this out of curiosity and frustrated beyond my anticipation. If you are still wanting this, you will have to first format the storage drive in DOS format (as FAT32), so that it works well with your WSL and host Windows operating systems. This is possible the best middle-ground that you can hit upon.</li><li>Use <a href="https://aka.ms/terminal" target="_blank">Windows Terminal</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.codonomics.com/2020/09/Cmder" target="_blank">Cmder</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty" target="_blank">Mintty</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> or any other console emulators. Why? You can customize it with default settings for each of WSLs, Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or other terminals integrated with it. Also Windows Terminal is lightweight and faster.</li><li>When you start your development server in WSL 2, try testing it in your browser with <b><i>localhost</i></b>, it won't work. WSL is one proper sandboxed environment or VM. You need to port forward localhost settings for this to work. This can be done by adding the line like below in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file in your windows <b><i>$HOME</i></b> directory.<br>--
 --<br>
 </li><li>WSL 2 can consume all of your host memory. You can set limits to it by appending the line&nbsp;<b><i>memory=16GB</i></b> in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file.</li><li>Do install <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" target="_blank">Oh-My-ZSH</a> to use zsh shell instead of the default bash. You get bunch of goodies like pre-configured aliases for Git and more by way of its plugins that you can configure to your preference.</li><li>If you are into using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank">tmux</a>, you can use that too in your WSL 2, and power it up with <a href="https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline" target="_blank">tmux-powerline</a>.</li><li>You can change the location of your WSL 2 distribution's virtual hard drive.&nbsp;I keep all of my VMs (and now WSL 2 virtual hard drives) in <b><i>D:\VMs\&lt;platform&gt;\&lt;distribution name&gt;</i></b>. Run the following commands in PowerShell - replacing distribution name and preferred location: <br>----<br> Also at the time of writing, when you import a distribution, you may need to tell WSL 2 to start the distribution using the Linux user account you created when you first created the distribution. Thanks to <a href="https://www.58bits.com/blog/2020/05/30/wsl-2-setup-development">58bits.com </a> that you can run the below PowerShell script that imports the distribution, and resets the default user as you would like it to be. <br>-- --<br> Note that if your import fails with 'Unspecified error' (or other) - you may need to limit the amount of memory allocated to <b><i>vmmem</i></b>. You can do this with WSL2 config to limit memory as mentioned in ProTip 5 above.</li><li>If you are into using VS-Code as your IDE for development, you can launch the one you installed on your host Windows 10 OS from WSL 2 bash in your project's root folder and executing <b><i>`code .`</i></b>. With this you can work on your windows operating system launching your development servers in WSL environment, thus getting the best of both the worlds. Additionally, you can install your vs-code extensions on remote wsl as well as on host OS, all from within your IDE.</li><li>And <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> works well with your WSL2 too. You just can extract the best from everything.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Windows 10 is super cool again with WSL 2. Whether you are a Windows buff wanting to leverage Linux goodies, or a Linux buff wanting to draw upon Windows 10 strengths, you can have it all. Happy coding!!..

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p><img src="https://blog.darrien.dev/fireworks-for-your-terminal/fireworks.gif" alt="fireworks display"></p>
<p>Recently I embarked on a fun little side project. There have been just too many
rampant fireworks going on outside and I was feeling a little left out, so I
decided to make some of my own.</p>
<p>Given I have no experience with anything like OpenGL at all, and was feeling
like learning <a href="https://crates.io/crates/termion">termion</a> since I
consistently use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tui">tui</a> with a termion backend and
only sort of understand how it works, I decided terminal fireworks would be the
way to go.</p>
<p>This little post traces my short journey to making my own terminal fireworks in
case you want to do it yourself and some logical extensions if you want to keep
building it afterwards. All code is in rust because rust.</p>
<p>If you are using rust and following along, you’ll probably want these
dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>dependencies</span>]
<span>termion</span> = <span>"1.5.5"</span>
<span>rand</span> = <span>"0.7"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This little doc provides some code, but does not give all the code required to
make it work. For that, you’ll need to write it yourself 😎</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/DarrienG/term-fireworks">My final result is here</a></p>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up<a href="#setting-up" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>When working with applications that have UIs, you almost always want to have
your rendering separate from input. I didn’t know how to do this for my terminal
typeracer application and it has <a href="https://gitlab.com/ttyperacer/terminal-typeracer/-/issues/2">haunted me ever
since</a>. <a href="https://gitlab.com/ttyperacer/terminal-typeracer">Terminal
typeracer</a> still works fine
without it since it only needs to update on keypress (for now at least), but for
an application meant to exclusively work with graphics that stops when you hit a
key, async rendering was required.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-async-rendering-pipeline">A simple async rendering pipeline<a href="#a-simple-async-rendering-pipeline" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Supposedly there is an <a href="https://docs.rs/termion/1.5.5/termion/fn.async_stdin.html">async stdin
directive</a> termion
provides, but it feels way too magical, so I ended up doing this manually. Plus
it’s a good learning experience, so two for one!</p>
<p>The first part of actually rendering with termion is that you need to steal
stdout. Then somewhere else, steal stdin and read and process events as they
come in.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> std::io::{stdin, stdout, Error};
<span>use</span> termion::{event::<span>*</span>, input::TermRead};

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() -&gt; Result<span>&lt;</span>Box<span>&lt;</span>dyn Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> {
  <span>// steal stdout, we can do stuff with it later
</span><span></span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> stdout <span>=</span> stdout().into_raw_mode()<span>?</span>;

  <span>// steal stdin, C-c will break out of the loop
</span><span></span>  <span>for</span> c <span>in</span> stdin().events() {
  <span>let</span> evt <span>=</span> c<span>?</span>;
  <span>match</span> evt {
    Event::Key(Key::Ctrl(<span>'c'</span>)) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>break</span>,
    _ <span>=&gt;</span> {}
  }

}
</code></pre></div><p>Now one of these has to go in a separate thread. If you’re like me, you might
think it makes more sense to have the rendering work go on a separate thread.
Unfortunately as I found out, this is a very bad idea.</p>
<p>Termion sets the terminal to raw mode and if you release the handle to raw mode
in another thread, the terminal will never look the same at the end. It will
switch the terminal out of raw mode, but there will be all sorts of character
aberrations. I tried all sorts of weird ways to get around this because I
thought it made more sense, but take my word for it here, it’s impossible.</p>
<p>So let’s set this up so it up so your terminal does not look evil when it’s
done.</p>
<p>The first step is really just spinning up a thread and setting up a receiver so
the two threads can chat. I’m using rust’s standard
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/">mpsc</a> for this. It works much like
Go’s channels. This is required since we’ll need a way to ask the renderer to
terminate from our stdin thread.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> std::{
  io::{stdin, stdout, Error},
  sync::{
    mpsc,
    mpsc::{Receiver, Sender},
  },
  thread,
};
<span>use</span> termion::{event::<span>*</span>, input::TermRead};


<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
  <span>let</span> (tx, rx): (Sender<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>, Receiver<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> mpsc::channel();
  thread::spawn(<span>||</span> capture_input(rx));
  render(rx);
}

<span>// capture keystrokes and ask renderer to stop when ^C is hit
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>capture_input</span>(sender: <span>Sender</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) { ... }

<span>// render fireworks display every so often
</span><span></span>render(receiver: <span>Receiver</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) { ... }
</code></pre></div><p>With just those few lines of code you’re off to the races. Async stdin! While I
haven’t checked, I’m fairly certain this is exactly how termion’s implementation
works.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-keypresses">Capturing keypresses<a href="#capturing-keypresses" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The implementation is not novel or interesting. <a href="https://gitlab.com/DarrienG/term-fireworks/-/blob/73f52c5f7ea85e6e14d05a66921e823342f052f3/src/input.rs">The whole thing is 18
lines</a>
and when it captures a <code>C-c</code>, it asks the renderer to stop.</p>

<p>The rest of this will talk about the rendering pipeline, and the design of
making a fun terminal firework render.</p>
<h2 id="firework-setup">Firework Setup<a href="#firework-setup" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Fireworks aren’t stagnant, they move around, shimmy and shine, and do all sorts
of funky stuff. For our naive firework implementation, we’ll want to define some
states our firework can get in, and we can handle each differently.</p>
<p>For my basic fireworks, I decided these were a reasonable set of states:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>FireworkState</span> {
  Flying,    <span>// Just a tail - going up
</span><span></span>  Exploding, <span>// Bursting outwards
</span><span></span>  Falling,   <span>// bursting out has stopped, fall from the tips and fade from center to tips
</span><span></span>  Fading,    <span>// tips disappear to fading at 2x the rate fade falls
</span><span></span>  Gone,      <span>// nothing, a blank canvas, the inner machinations of my mind
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>We’ll then want each firework to have a set of these states until there is
naught but Gone left.</p>
<p>We can generate these on the fly, or we can do it all at once up front. I found
it a little more convenient to generate them all up front, and at some point I’d
be interested in making a backwards/forwards control on my fireworks, so that’s
what I went with.</p>
<p>For the sake of testing I wanted the fireworks to be consistent, but for the
sake of 🎉 fun 🎉 I wanted them to be random. The compromise was using seeded
random.</p>
<p>It was one of the first times I’d ever manually seeded a rand value besides one
time I had to use C++ in college. Rust doesn’t make it too hard though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> rand::StdRng;

<span>// make a new firework
</span><span></span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(seed: <span>u64</span>) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
  <span>let</span> rng <span>=</span> StdRng::seed_from_u64(seed);
  <span>// who care
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Using this seed, we are able to now ensure all random values are generated
deterministically.</p>
<p><em>Note: rng objects are mutable and work kind of like iterators. If we
decide to only pass the seed around, all fireworks would be generated
identically, thus we want to pass around the cloned rng object to get an
increased level of randomness.</em></p>
<p>Finally we set some random thresholds, generate a list of states for our
firework object, and we’re off to the races.</p>
<h2 id="each-phase-and-how-they-are-rendered">Each phase and how they are rendered<a href="#each-phase-and-how-they-are-rendered" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Now that we have each of our firework phases clearly defined, it’s time to talk
about what each one does at a lower level.</p>
<h2 id="the-center">The center<a href="#the-center" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>This is the smallest part, and not even a phase, but worth mentioning because
most everything will use it for absolute or relative positioning. Before
anything is really made, I decide the firework starting point (I also use it as
the center).  It’s just a point with an y value of 0, and an x value of
<code>range(0, u64::MAX)</code></p>
<h3 id="were-soaring-flying">(We’re Soaring…) Flying<a href="#were-soaring-flying" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Flying is the most simple of the components. It starts with a single point:</p>
<pre><code>*
</code></pre><p>And after each phase, it grows one up. So:</p>
<p>Two phases:</p>
<pre><code>*
*
</code></pre><p>Three phases:</p>
<pre><code>*
*
*
</code></pre><p>Very simple.</p>
<p>I considered making the bottom of the tail shrink ever 2 or 3 phases, but
figured it was unnecessary because of the next phase.</p>
<h3 id="exploding">Exploding<a href="#exploding" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Exploding is more fun and takes a little more effort. But let’s do the simple
stuff first.</p>
<p>The exploding action should make the tail shrink by one from the bottom. This
helps signify the explosion is starting.</p>
<p>The actual exploding part is a little more complex though. Given the low pixel
nature of a terminal, I decided the best way forward was to explode out two
different sections at different intervals. The cross section was to be exploded
on every exploding interval, while diagonal exploding out points were to happen
every two intervals.</p>
<p>For instance…
(note, spaces added because my font thinks *** is a ligature)</p>
<p>Phase 1:</p>
<pre><code>  *
* * *
  *
</code></pre><p>Phase 2:</p>
<pre><code>    *
  * * *
* * * * *
  * * *
    *
</code></pre><p>Phase 3:</p>
<pre><code>     *
     *
   * * *
* * * * * *
   * * *
     *
     *
</code></pre><p>Phase 4:</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *  *  *
     * * *
* * * * * * * *
     * * *
   *   *   *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>You can see it looks a little bit awkward for tiny explosions, and starts to
look more normal around phase 4. Phase 4+ looks like a nice little explosion and
works much better with falling as you’ll see when there are staggered cross and
diagonal explosions.</p>
<h3 id="falling">Falling<a href="#falling" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>At this point the tail should be gone, but if it isn’t, we remove it. Good
riddance.</p>
<p>We also begin to collapse the explosion inward.</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *  *  *
     *   *
* * *     * * *
     *   *
   *   *   *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>With each phase removing from the inside out until the edges are reached.</p>
<p>This too follows the two phased cross =&gt; cross + diagonal =&gt; cross =&gt; …</p>
<p>Falling isn’t called falling because the inside of the fireworks collapses though,
it also falls!</p>
<p>It’s a little hard to show without extra color with the last diagram, so I will
show a fully collapsed explosion to illustrate.</p>
<pre><code>       *
        
    *     *
          
*             *
          
   *       *
        
       *
</code></pre><p>This is what a fully collapsed firework (with no falling steps yet) looks like.
For falling, each of these points draws downward, like an inverse tail.</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *     *
    *     *
*             *
*             *
   *       *
   *       *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>With a not fully collapsed firework, this looks extra cool. Let’s add two more
to fully show the effect.</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *  *  *
    *  *  *
*   *     *   *
*   *     *   *
*  *       *  *
*  *       *  *
   *   *   *
   *   *   *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>Pretty neat, right?</p>
<p>This strategy sort of looks a little funky when working with smaller explosions,
but works quite well for explosions of size 4 and larger.</p>
<h2 id="fading">Fading<a href="#fading" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Finally comes fading (well technically Gone is the last step, but it just
deletes everything, so it isn’t worth talking about).</p>
<p>Fading is quite simple. We take the end points from the explosion:</p>
<pre><code>       *
        
    *     *
          
*             *
          
   *       *
        
       *
</code></pre><p>And delete from those, to the final point we created during the Falling phase 1
at a time.</p>
<p>This goes on for as long as we generated falling states for.</p>
<p>Eventually your firework disappears and that’s it!</p>

<p>So now we’ve defined the firework and its stages. We have more or less
implemented a firework, how are we going to get it onto a user’s screen?</p>

                <p>We’ve been using runc at work in production for a while now and although it seemed somewhat obscure at first, we’ve come around to being used to it so much so that it seems more intuitive than docker. I wanted to write this blogpost as a gentle introduction to runc for folks who want to try it out. This blogpost will try to serve as a quick primer on getting started with runc i.e. managing a container lifecycle with runc.</p>


<p>runc is a lightweight portable container runtime parts of which were internally used by Docker and were packaged as a single binary and released as an open source project under the the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) as a way of giving back to the community[1]. Explained simply, runc is a lightweight tool written in Go which helps manage a container’s lifecycle i.e creating, running, killing and deleting a container. You’ll go through each of these steps in this post and see how runc differs from Docker when it comes to running containers.</p>

<p>You’ll work with the official golang docker image as a running example for the purpose of this article. You can find more details about this image on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/golang">Docker Hub</a>.</p>


<p>Unlike docker, runc doesn’t abstract tedious tasks under the hood and rather expects you to arrange whatever is it that is required for it to work. Let’s run through the requirements:</p>

<h2 id="runc-binary">runc Binary</h2>
<p>runc is a portable piece of software, for GNU/Linux users, it’s as simple as fetching the binary and giving execute permissions to it in order to work with runc:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>curl <span>-L</span> <span>-o</span> /usr/bin/runc https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc10/runc.amd64 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>chmod</span> +x /usr/bin/runc</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can head over to the project’s <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">release page</a> to download other versions. It’s also worth noting that runc doesn’t work on macOS so if you are on a Mac, your best bet is to run runc inside a docker container.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-spec">runtime-spec</h2>
<p>Specifying configuration options such as volume mounts, memory limits or uid:gid mapping while running a container with docker is as simple as specifying command line options to the docker command. While using runc, these configurations are passed to runc as a file. This configuration file, the runtime-spec, is a configuration standard put in place by the Open Container Initiative (OCI) to specify options for a container and is used by runc[2]. In simpler words, the runtime-spec is a JSON file named <code>config.json</code> consisting of configurations pertaining to a specific container.</p>

<p>You’ll go through a few attributes in the runtime-spec in this post to get enough understanding so as to be able to run containers. Later sections will focus on attributes which require further explanation. Consider this sample runtime-spec snippet:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

		"</span><span>noNewPrivileges</span><span>": true
	},
    ...
}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>runc expects the configuration file in the exact same format with a certain required fields and a few other optional ones. You might have figured out a few options from the snippet above alone for instance, the environment variables, the current working directory and the uid:gid mapping. There are other configuration options which give you more control over how the container should perform that you’ll go through in the sections to follow.</p>

<h2 id="root-filesystem">Root filesystem</h2>
<p>This is exactly what it sounds like, root filesystem for the container. There are multiple ways you can get hold of a root filesystem from a Docker image but the easiest and the one advised by the OCI is using <code>docker export</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>docker <span>export</span> <span>$(</span>docker create golang<span>)</span> | <span>tar</span> <span>-C</span> rootfs <span>-xvf</span> -</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will generate the unarchived root filesystem for our golang docker image which you’ll now use to create containers using runc.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve gathered up the required prerequisites, you can now go ahead and run containers using runc.</p>


<p>Before running the container, you’ve to make sure you have all the prerequisites in the required manner. The <code>runc</code> binary, by default, looks for the root filesystem and the runtime-spec in a directory which is referred to as a “bundle”. The bundle directory must have the runtime-spec(config.json) and the root filesystem(rootfs) in order for runc to work.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">~/golang
.
├── config.json
└── rootfs/
      ├── home/
      ├── tmp/
      ├── ..
      └── ..</code></pre></figure>

<p>As shown above, having such a directory, you’ll be able to run runc commands in the <code>~/golang</code> directory for it to work appropriately.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, you can go ahead and create the container:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>runc create golang

<span># list active containers</span>
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          created     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:23:46.7358607Z   root

<span># starts running the user-defined command inside the container</span>
<span>$ </span>runc start golang

<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:23:46.7358607Z   root

<span># creates and starts the container</span>
<span>$ </span>runc run <span>-d</span> golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root</code></pre></figure>

<p>Contrary to the title of this section, there are multiple commands to “spin up” a container using runc. In the snippet above, we used the following commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>create</code>: creates an instance of the container from the bundle but it doesn’t run the command specified as an entrypoint in the runtime-spec(config.json).</li>
  <li><code>start</code>: runs the init command(specified in the runtime-spec) for a created container. This essentially means your container is now “running”. Your application or whatever command you’re running inside the container can now respond to requests or do the job you intend it to do.</li>
  <li><code>run</code>: it creates and starts the container. Passing a <code>-d</code> will run the container in detached mode. You’ll be using this command more frequently than individually creating and then starting the container.</li>
  <li><code>list</code>: lists containers you’ve created, they could be running, paused, stopped or in created state. (not an exhaustive list of states). This is most useful to inquire about the current status of the containers that you’ve started or stopped with runc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can now “spin up” containers with runc, killing or deleting containers with runc is also fairly straightforward.</p>


<p>Once you’ve started the container and played around with it, you need to discard it in such a manner that it does not run in the background holding onto resources or populating your pid tables for virtually no reason.</p>

<p>Although there’s no <code>stop</code> command provided by runc, the <code>runc kill</code> command, when run without any options, sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to the init process of the container thereby stopping the container. This moves the container to a <code>stopped</code> state. Your container might still be holding on to certain resources used by processes contained by your container though. As a side not, while you’re at the topic of killing of processes inside containers, it’s worthwhile to go through issues associated with handling of <a href="https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/">zombie processes in docker</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>runc delete</code> command frees up any resources that a container is holding on to thereby completely removing the container. You won’t be able to inspect this container in any way (checking filesystem or otherwise), and it will not show up when you do <code>runc list</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># creates and starts the container</span>
<span>$ </span>runc run <span>-d</span> golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root

<span>$ </span>runc <span>kill </span>golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          stopped     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root

<span>$ </span>runc delete golang
<span>$ </span>runc list</code></pre></figure>

<p>You’ve sent a signal to a running container and then released any resources held by that container in stopped state to completely “stop it”. Read more about additional options you can use with these commands by running <code>runc &lt;command&gt; --help</code>.</p>

<p>You can now manage a container using runc, you’ll take it one step further and see how you can checkpoint/restore a container with runc.</p>


<p>Similar to docker, runc provides a handy functionality to checkpoint/restore running containers. You can think of checkpointing a container as serializing the state of a running process and then storing the contents on disk. This serialized blob has all the metadata required to restore the process to the same point from when it was checkpointed at a later point in time. That’s an extremely simplified explanation of how criu works. It’s a lot more complex than it sounds but it’s adequate for the purpose of this article.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, runc uses <code>criu</code>, an open source piece of software which does the actual checkpoint and restore. In order to use runc commands such as <code>checkpoint</code> and <code>restore</code>, you ought to have the criu binary installed on your host system. You can find instruction for installing criu <a href="https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu">here</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># run the container in detached mode</span>
<span>$ </span>runc run <span>-d</span> golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root

<span>$ </span>runc checkpoint golang

<span>$ </span>runc restore golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above snippet, you checkpoint the golang container while it was running. When you checkpoint a container, <code>criu</code> stores the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span lang="EN-AU">IBM made some announcements today relating to
their latest POWER7 server offerings. The new line of systems includes new
entry level systems and the highly anticipated high-end system, the POWER7 <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&amp;infotype=an&amp;appname=iSource&amp;supplier=897&amp;letternum=ENUS110-158">795</a>!
<span></span>They also officially outlined some of
the new features available in AIX 7.1. You can review the details <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/cgi-bin/common/ssi/ssialias?infotype=an&amp;subtype=ca&amp;htmlfid=897/ENUS210-200&amp;appname=isource&amp;language=enus">here</a>.
Ive discussed some of these new features </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/aix_7_open_beta_is_live_it_s_time_to_test?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
and </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/creating_an_aix_5_2_wpar_on_aix_7?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
The official AIX 7.1 announcement details are available </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/news/announcement/20100817_annc.html"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The announcement got me thinking about my
recent customer engagements and why some have chosen to deploy AIX into their
IBM POWER environments, while others are considering a Linux on POWER solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Ive found that it usually comes down to a
skills decision more than anything else. Most customers are happy to either
continue working with AIX (if they are existing AIX users) or migrate from
another UNIX OS to AIX. Ive seen very few customers actually migrate to Linux
on POWER, but Ive worked with several that have seriously considered it. Those
that have chosen to deploy Linux are doing so purely because they have in-house
Linux skills. They are concerned that migrating to AIX may be too big a jump
for their technical staff. I find this thinking interesting, as most of the
customers Ive dealt with who run other UNIX OSs like Tru64, Solaris or HP-UX
are more than happy to migrate to AIX. They believe the move is relatively
minor and doesnt require massive re-training of their UNIX admins. I tend to
agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For me, <b>AIX</b>
is my preferred Enterprise class UNIX Operating System. Notice Im prefacing
this with the words <b><i>Enterprise class</i></b>. Dont get me wrong, I have worked with Linux
systems in both small and large customer environments. It is a great OS. But
Ive found that it really only fits into environments that have a relatively
small number of users and where significant downtime can be tolerated for
things like operating system maintenance. This doesnt fit the Enterprise class
of UNIX server OSs that Im thinking of here. When I contemplate the word <i>Enterprise</i>, I think of servers and
operating systems that can respond to business demands in terms of performance,
reliability, stability and availability. An Enterprise UNIX can provide all of
these things without compromise. Linux can offer performance and reliability
(in my opinion). However, from what Ive seen, it lacks features &amp; functions
in the areas of stability and availability. AIX on the other hand ticks all the
boxes. Again, this is just my opinion based on my experiences with both AIX and
Linux in the Enterprise landscape. Others will no doubt have their own
experiences that may or may not match my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">So when Im designing an Enterprise UNIX
server environment for a customer, I always start with an AIX on POWER base. If
the customer wants Linux, sure I can look at that too, but I strongly recommend
AIX as my preferred choice for large systems. Most of my customers are running
relatively large SAP/Oracle systems. AIX on POWER is a great combination for
large Enterprise systems. If you need to deploy large database systems that
must service tens of thousands of users (like a big SAP system), then I believe
AIX is the perfect OS on which to provide a platform for these large scale
systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX is a very mature and powerful UNIX OS. It
has been a major player in the UNIX server market for over 20 years (as shown
below). Some people are just not aware of how mature, robust and stable the AIX
OS has become over the years. There are many impressive aspects of the OS in
the areas of performance, scalability, reliability, management and
administration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p></o:p></span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif"></a> </p>





<p><span lang="EN-AU">Just looking at some of the administration
capabilities built into AIX are enough for me to always recommend AIX over
Linux (or any other UNIX OS), when it comes to large Enterprise servers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For example, the System Management Interface Tool (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-smit/index.html"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">) can make the UNIX admins life a lot simpler.
This is an interactive tool that is part of the AIX OS. Almost all tasks that
an AIX administrator may need to perform can be executed using this tool. It is
a text-based tool (there is also an X interface but I recommend sticking with
the text-based menus). Everything it does, it does through standard AIX
commands and Korn shell functions. This feature is especially useful when you
need to automate a repetitive task; you can have SMIT create the proper
command-line sequence, and you can then use those commands in your own script.
My compatriot, Anthony English, has a nice intro to </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/AIXDownUnder/entry/smitty_to_his_friends20?lang=en"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> on his AIX blog. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The
<b>AIX Logical Volume Manager</b> (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0106.pdf"><span>LVM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">)
is built into the OS, for free. AIX LVM helps UNIX system administrators </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aixstorage/index.html"><span>manage their
storage</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> in a very flexible manner. LVM allows logical
volumes to span multiple physical volumes. Data on logical volumes appears to
be contiguous to the user, but might not be contiguous on the physical volume.
This allows file systems, paging space, and other logical volumes to be resized
or relocated, span multiple physical volumes, and have their contents
replicated for greater flexibility and availability. It provides capabilities
for mirroring data across disks, migrating data across disks &amp; storage
subsystems, expand/shrink filesystems and more.......all of which can be
performed dynamically.....<b>no downtime</b>
required. The concept, implementation and interface to the AIX LVM is one of a
kind. All of its features support the continuous availability philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">One of the biggest reasons that I love AIX
over Linux is the <b>mksysb</b>. Its built
into the OS and allows you to create a bootable image of your AIX system. This
image can be used to restore a broken AIX system or for cloning other systems.
The cloning feature is truly amazing. You can take an image created on a
low-end system and deploy it on any POWER system, all the way up to the
high-end POWER boxes. This simplifies the installation and cloning processing
when you need to install and manage many AIX LPARs. By using an SOE mksysb
image you can deploy consistent AIX images across your Enterprise POWER server
environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">This brings me to another wonderful feature of
AIX, the <b>Network Installation Manager</b>
(</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247296.html?Open"><span>NIM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">).
NIM is powerful network installation tool (comparable to Linux Kickstart).
Using NIM you can backup/restore, update and upgrade one or more AIX systems
either individually or simultaneously. This can all be achieved over a network
connection, removing the need for handling physical installation media forever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Another fine example of AIXs superior OS management tools is </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/aix/aprilmay08/tipstechniques/20226p1.aspx"><span>multibos</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">. This tool allows an AIX administrator to
create and maintain two separate, bootable instances of the AIX OS within the
same root volume group (rootvg). This second instance of rootvg is known as a
standby Base Operating System (BOS) and is an extremely handy tool for
performing AIX TL and Service Pack (SP) updates. Multibos lets you install,
update and customize a standby instance of the AIX OS <b>without impacting</b> the running and active production instance of the
AIX OS. This is valuable in environments with tight maintenance windows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">When it comes to upgrading the OS to a new
release of AIX, the </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-migrate_nimadm/index.html"><span>nimadm</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
utility can assist the administrator greatly in this task. </span><span lang="EN-AU">The <b><span>nimadm</span></b>
utility offers several advantages. For example, a system administrator can use <b><span>nimadm</span></b> to create a copy of a
NIM client's rootvg and migrate the disk to a newer version or release of AIX.
All of this can be done <b>without
disruption</b> to the client (there is no outage required to perform the
migration). After the migration is finished, the only downtime required will be
a single scheduled reboot of the system.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX
6.1 introduced new capability that most UNIX operating systems are still
working on. </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&amp;context=SG11G&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=isg3T1012104&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=utf-8&amp;lang=#concurrent"><span>Concurrent
Updates of the AIX Kernel</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.....<b>without a reboot</b>! IBM is always working hard at making AIX an OS
that can provide <b>continuous availability</b>,
even if it needs to be patched. AIX now has the ability to update certain kernel
components and kernel extensions in place, without needing a system reboot. In
addition, concurrent updates can be removed from the system without needing a
reboot. Can you do this with other UNIX OSs? <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And thats just some of the features that make
AIX <b>the</b> only UNIX OS that I recommend
for Enterprise systems. There are many more tools and features that I couldnt
live without (like alt_disk_install, savevg, installp, WPARs, etc, the list
goes on). If you are new to AIX and you are considering what your next UNIX OS
should be, then I recommend you take a <b>very</b>
close look at </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://ibm.com/aix"><span>AIX</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And finally, the support provided by IBM, is
first class. Whenever Ive needed assistance with an AIX issue or query, I have
always received timely, professional and useful advice. On the rare occasions
where Ive uncovered a new bug, IBM AIX support have always been quick to
provide me with an interim fix to resolve or workaround a problem. Thats the
sort of support youd expect for an Enterprise UNIX OS, isnt it? Whats the
support like from your current UNIX (or Linux) OS vendor?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Linux is still a viable UNIX operating system.
However, I think its more suited to certain workloads like small to medium
size mail, web and other utility servers and services. AIX, however, would be
my platform of choice for my 10TB Oracle database running SAP ERP, not just for
performance reasons, but primarily because of the system administration
features of AIX that allow me to support and manage the system without
impacting my customers or enforcing reboots/outages whenever I need to change
something on the system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">All IBM need to do is create their own Linux
distribution (Blue Linux perhaps?)
that has all the features of AIX built in and then Im sold! But why would
they? We already have AIX.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p>In <a href="https://pkolaczk.github.io/disk-parallelism/">the previous post</a>, I showed how processing 
file data in parallel can either boost or hurt performance 
depending on the workload and device capabilities. Therefore, in complex programs that mix tasks
of different types using different physical resources, e.g. CPU, storage (e.g. HDD/SSD) 
or network I/O, a need may arise to configure parallelism levels differently for each task type. 
This is typically solved by scheduling tasks of different types on dedicated thread pools.
In this post I’m showing how to implement a solution in Rust with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a>. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>After I realized multi-threaded access to data on a single HDD is a <em>really bad idea</em>, 
I wanted to process files residing on HDD with only one thread-per-device, but still keep multithreading for SSDs.
Also, both groups of files should be processed independently, in parallel.
Honestly, that didn’t look like something hard to do. I’ve been using thread pools in Java for years.
For each file to process, I just need to schedule an asynchronous hashing task on a proper thread pool 
executor and that’s it. How hard could that be in Rust?</p>

<p>My program already used Rayon in a very functional style, so the main part of the code responsible for file hashing 
looked like that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>   <span>// collection of input files</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>files</span>
  <span>.into_par_iter</span><span>()</span>           <span>// creates a Rayon parallel iterator over all files</span>
  <span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>f</span><span>|</span> <span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span>  <span>// reads the contents of a file and returns its hash; blocking</span>
  <span>.collect</span><span>();</span>                
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this approach, all the files are processed by the default Rayon thread pool and
there is no place to tell Rayon which thread pool to use for given file.</p>



<p>Rayon allows to build custom thread pools with <code>ThreadPoolBuilder</code> and <code>ThreadPool</code> structs. 
It is quite easy to create a custom thread pool and manually spawn tasks on it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>thread</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.build</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to process our collection on this custom thread pool, we need to change the “main loop” of 
a program slightly and replace the parallel iterator with a traditional loop and a channel to receive the 
results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.build</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>  
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>);</span> <span>// need to close all senders, otherwise...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>rx</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.collect</span><span>();</span>  <span>// ... this would block</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>Now it is quite straightforward to transform this approach to more than one thread pool:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ssd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 

<span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>  
    <span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>is_on_ssd</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>&amp;</span><span>ssd_pool</span> 
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>&amp;</span><span>hdd_pool</span> 
    <span>};</span>
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>);</span> 
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>rx</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.collect</span><span>();</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation of <code>is_on_ssd</code> is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>


<p>Unfortunately <code>ThreadPool.spawn()</code> method requires that the lambda passed to it has a 
<code>'static</code> lifetime, which means it must not borrow any data other than global. 
The examples above work only because we pass all the input data by <code>move</code>, so the lambda
does not close over anything outside and the <code>'static</code> constraint is satisfied.</p>

<p>Of course the real world is much more complex, and, in my program actually the spawned task<br>
needed to borrow the local context, which holds some common stuff like configuration or logger.</p>

<p>Referencing any outside variable from inside of <code>spawn</code> lambda does not compile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>logger</span><span>:</span> <span>Log</span> <span>=</span> <span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>logger</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>logger</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"Computing hash of: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>.display</span><span>()));</span>
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

</pre>

<p>The compiler can’t see that all the tasks we spawned must finish before we leave the scope
where <code>logger</code> is valid. This is where Rayon scopes are coming to rescue us.</p>

<p>Instead of spawning tasks directly on the thread pool struct, we first need to create a scope 
object by calling <code>scope</code> function. The scope is guaranteed to exit only after all tasks launched 
inside it finished. This essentially allows the tasks inside the scope to access variables that live 
at least as long as the scope:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>

            <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about multiple thread pools? 
A single <code>Scope</code> in Rayon is always associated with a single <code>ThreadPool</code>. 
Therefore, if we need multiple thread pools, then we need multiple scopes, active at the same time.
Fortunately, scopes can be nested:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>logger</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Log</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span>
<span>hdd_pool</span><span>.scope</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>hdd_scope</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ssd_pool</span><span>.scope</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>ssd_scope</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>is_on_ssd</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

              <span>hdd_scope</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>});</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="dynamic-number-of-thread-pools">Dynamic Number of Thread Pools</h2>
<p>With only two pools, nesting doesn’t look bad, but in my program I needed more than two pools – 
one per each physical device. And even worse, I didn’t know the number of them statically at compile time.</p>

<p>At this point I wanted to abstract out the process of creating nested scopes in a way it doesn’t pollute the 
logic of the program. I came up with the following function idea:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>multi_scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>OP</span><span>:</span> <span>for</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'s</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>FnOnce</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>&gt;</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span> <span>+</span> <span>'scope</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span><span>,</span>
    <span>R</span><span>:</span> <span>Send</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes an array of <code>ThreadPool</code> references, constructs a <code>Scope</code> for each <code>ThreadPool</code> 
and executes a user-defined operation (typically passed as a lambda) inside all of these scopes.
The operation receives a list of references to <code>Scope</code> so it can spawn tasks on desired <code>Scope</code> associated
with the given <code>ThreadPool</code>. The usage is quite straightforward and very similar to the built-in <code>scope</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>

<p>How to implement <code>multi_scope</code>? There is no way to obtain a <code>Scope</code> value directly from Rayon.
The only way we can get a reference to a <code>Scope</code> is inside the lambda passed to <code>scope</code>.
So if we need multiple scopes active at the same time, we must nest scopes in each other. 
This sounds like a recursion.</p>

<h2 id="my-code-is-correct-but-the-borrow-checker-disagrees">My Code Is Correct, But The Borrow Checker Disagrees</h2>
<p>My initial take looked like this:</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An additional function <code>nest</code> creates one new <code>Scope</code> and pushes it into the <code>scopes</code> vector, then it calls itself
recursively until it runs out of <code>ThreadPool</code> values. Finally it calls the user operation <code>op</code> 
passing the created <code>scopes</code> vector to it.</p>

<p>To my surprise that didn’t compile. Oh well!</p>
<pre>error[E0621]: explicit lifetime required in the type of `scopes`
  --&gt; src/pools.rs:42:25
   |
34 | fn nest&lt;'scope, OP, R&gt;(pools: &amp;[&amp;ThreadPool], scopes: Vec&lt;&amp;Scope&lt;'scope&gt;&gt;, op: OP) -&gt; R

   |                         ^ lifetime `'scope` required

</pre>

<p>Wait, there is a hint here. As usual with Rust coding, let’s apply the hint the compiler gave to us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>nest</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>scopes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>'scope</span> <span>Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this made it only worse:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's install OpenBSD on a Lenovo Thinkpad X270. I used this computer for my
computer science studies. It has both Arch Linux and Windows 10 installed as
dual boot. Now that I'm no longer required to run Windows, I can ditch the dual
boot and install an operating system of my choice.</p>

<p>First, I grab my work Thinkpad running Arch Linux and some USB dongle big enough
for the <a href="https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/miniroot67.fs">amd64 miniroot
image</a> (roughly
five megabytes, that is). This small image does not include the file sets, which
will be downloaded during installation instead. I also download the <a href="https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/SHA256">SHA256
checksums</a> from the
Swiss mirror, and verify the downloaded image, before I copy it on my dongle:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256 
miniroot67.fs: OK
$ sudo dd if=miniroot67.fs of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>The Thinkpad X270 is connected to my network through Ethernet. The WiFi firmware
usually needs to be installed separately, so only Ethernet will work out of the
box. The BIOS has UEFI activated. OpenBSD and UEFI has issues on older hardware
(at least on a 2014 Dell laptop I have), but let's try it on this laptop,
anyway.</p>
<p>I plug in the dongle prepared before, and start the computer. I interrupt
the regular boot with Enter and pick an alternative boot method by pressing F12.
Now I pick my USB dongle. After roughly a minute, the installer has been
started. Now I follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I choose the option <code>I</code> to install OpenBSD.</li>
<li>For the keyboard layout, I pick <code>sg</code>, for Swiss German.</li>
<li>As a hostname, I simply pick <code>x270</code>, because it's a Thinkpad X270, and I'm not
  very creative when it comes to naming things.</li>
<li>From the available network options (<code>iwm0</code>: WiFi, <code>em0</code>: Ethernet, and
  <code>vlan0</code>: Virtual LAN), I pick <code>em0</code>.</li>
<li>I try to get an IPv4 address over DHCP, which seems to work very quickly.</li>
<li>Next, I type in my very secret root password twice.</li>
<li>I do <em>not</em> start <code>sshd</code> by default, because I don't need to connect to this
  machine through SSH. It's supposed to be a workstation, not a server.</li>
<li>The X Window System should not be started by <code>xnodm(1)</code>, so I leave it to
  <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Neither do I want to change the default to <code>com0</code>.</li>
<li>I set up my user <code>patrick</code> with my proper name <code>Patrick Bucher</code>, and a decent
  password.</li>
<li>The time zone has been detected properly as <code>Europe/Zurich</code>, which I just
  leave the way it is.</li>
<li>The installer detected two disks: <code>sd0</code> and <code>sd1</code>. Since <code>sd0</code> is the detected
  SSD in my laptop, the UEFI issue from my Dell laptop doesn't exist on this
  computer. I pick <code>sd0</code> for the root disk, since <code>sd1</code> is my USB dongle.</li>
<li>I choose to use the whole disk with a GPT partitioning schema, because it's
  2020.</li>
<li>An auto-allocated layout for <code>sd0</code> is presented. It looks decent to me, so I
  just go with that auto layout.</li>
<li>I don't want to initialize another disk, so I just press Enter (<code>done</code>).</li>
<li>Since the miniroot image does not come with the file sets, I pick <code>http</code> as
  the location for the sets.</li>
<li>I don't use a proxy, and use the mirror <code>mirrog.ungleich.ch</code> and the server
  directory <code>pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code> as proposed.</li>
<li>Next, I unselect the game sets by entering <code>-game*</code>. (I heard that they're not
  much fun to play.) I leave all the other sets activated, including the <code>x</code>
  sets, which will be required for the GUI later on.</li>
<li>After those sets are installed, I press Enter (<code>done</code>). Now the installer
  performs various tasks, after which I choose to <code>halt</code> the computer. This
  gives me time to remove the USB dongle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I now restart my laptop, and OpenBSD boots. This takes more time than booting
Arch Linux, which uses <code>systemd</code>, whereas OpenBSD uses <code>rc</code>, which performs the
startup tasks sequentially.</p>
<p>There's a message showing up that various firmware (<code>intel-firmware</code>,
<code>iwm-firmware</code>, <code>inteldrm-firmware</code>, <code>uvideo-firmware</code>, and <code>vmm-firmware</code>) has
been installed automatically. Very nice, indeed.</p>
<h2>WiFi Connection</h2>
<p>Now that the <code>iwm-firmware</code> has been installed, I can connect right away to my
WiFi network <code>frzbxpdb5</code>. I create a file called <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>, wich
<code>hostname</code> being a literal string, and <code>iwm0</code> being the WiFi network card. The
connection to my WiFi network consists of a single line:</p>
<pre><code>dhcp nwid frzbxpdb5 wpakey [my-wpakey]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>frzbxpdb5</code> is my WiFi network's ESSID, and <code>[my-wpakey]</code> needs to be
replaced by the actual WPA key.</p>
<p>Then the networking can be restarted for that device:</p>
<pre><code># sh /etc/netstart iwm0
</code></pre>
<p>This script is kind enough to set the file permissions of <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>
to <code>640</code>, and then connects to my WiFi network.</p>
<p>I unplug the Ethernet cable and <code>ping openbsd.org</code>, which works fine, even after
a restart.</p>

<p>My GUI on Unix-like systems is based on the Dynamic Window Manager (<code>dwm</code>) and a
couple of other tools, such as <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, <code>slstatus</code>, <code>slock</code>, all created and
maintained by the <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a> community.</p>
<p>This software doesn't come with configuration facilities, but needs to be
configured in the respective C header file <code>config.h</code>, and then re-compiled.
Even though OpenBSD offers <code>dwm</code> as a package, customizing and configuring that
window manager requires to build it from source.</p>
<h2>Building <code>dwm</code> and Friends</h2>
<p>First, I need to install <code>git</code> to fetch the source code:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add git
</code></pre>
<p>Then I fetch the source code for <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, and <code>slstatus</code> from <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/slstatus
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dwm</code></h3>
<p>Next, I try to build <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd dwm
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This fails with an error message (<code>'ft2build.h' file not found</code>), which reminds
me of building <code>dwm</code> on FreeBSD roughly a month before. Since I can finde the
header file at another location:</p>
<pre><code># find / -type f -name ft2build.h
/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2/ft2build.h
</code></pre>
<p>I simply can modify the <code>config.mk</code> accordingly by changing</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = $(X11INC}/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, I only need to comment the above line, and uncomment the line below</p>
<pre><code># OpenBSD (uncomment)
</code></pre>
<p>The Suckless folks obviously are friendly towards OpenBSD, which is also
noticable in other places (more evidence to be shown further below).</p>
<p>The next compilation attempt succeeds:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>So let's install <code>dwm</code>, too:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<p>By default, and as to be seen in <code>config.h</code>, the keyboard combination
<code>[Alt]+[Shift]+[Enter]</code> (deeply engraved into the muscle memories of many <code>dwm</code>
users) starts the <code>st</code> terminal. This will be built in a while. However, I
prefer to use the <em>Super</em> or <em>Windows</em> key instead of <code>Alt</code>, since the former
is of no use in OpenBSD, and the latter still comes in handy when working with
the emacs readline mode. Therefore, I change the <code>MODKEY</code> from</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod1Mask
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod4Mask
</code></pre>
<p>Then I rebuild and reinstall <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>st</code></h3>
<p>Let's switch over to the <code>st</code> source directory and just try to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../st
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we get a warning that the function <code>pledge</code> (an OpenBSD mitigation, which
is built into the <code>master</code> branch, but surrounded by an <code>ifdef</code> preprocessor
statement, so that it will only be compiled for OpenBSD) is imported implicitly.
Let's just ignore this warning for now.</p>
<p>What's worse, the compilation fails with the error message:</p>
<pre><code>ld: error: unable to find library -lrt
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the FAQ comes in handy, stating that</p>
<pre><code>If you want to compile st for OpenBSD you have to remove -lrt from
config.mk, ...
</code></pre>
<p>Having done so in <code>config.mk</code>, <code>st</code> compiles without any further issues, and,
thus, can be rebuilt and installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dmenu</code></h3>
<p>Even OpenBSD users with Suckless tools have to open another GUI application than
a terminal emulator once in a while. For this purpose, Suckless offers <code>dmenu</code>.
Let's switch over to it and compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../dmenu
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we have the issue with <code>ft2build.h</code>, which can be resolved as above with
<code>dwm</code>: by using the proper path for <code>FREETYPEINC</code> in <code>config.mk</code>. Afterwards,
the build succeeds, and <code>dmenu</code> can be installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>slstatus</code></h3>
<p><code>dwm</code> has a status bar on the top right, which can be used to show various
information. I used to write some shell commands in <code>.xinitrc</code> to compose such a
status line, and then set it by <code>xset -b</code> once every five seconds or so. This
approach generates a multitude of processes every couple of seconds.</p>
<p><code>slstatus</code> is a C programm that is capable of showing various kinds of more or
less useful information. Let's switch over to <code>slstatus</code> and see, what is
available in <code>config.def.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../slstatus
$ less config.def.h
</code></pre>
<p>The comments section lists different functions (<code>battery_perc</code> for the battery
percentage, <code>datetime</code> for date and time information, <code>temp</code> for thermal
information, etc.). I usually display the CPU load, the battery percentage, the
memory usage, the current keyboard layout, and the current date and time.</p>
<p>Before configuring those, let's try to compile <code>slstatus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, so let's configure the information to be displayed in
<code>config.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    "%s",     "%F %T" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This renders the current date as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%F %T"
2020-09-05 19:26:38
</code></pre>
<p>I also like to have the weekday included, but not the seconds, so I define a
different argument string:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
Sat 2020-09-05 19:27
</code></pre>
<p>That's better, so let's use it in <code>config.h</code> (surrounded with some spaces in the
format string):</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    " %s ",   "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>The other settings I like to have do not require any arguments, at least not on
OpenBSD, so I only need to define a decent format string (with <code>|</code> as a
seperator) for those:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format           argument */
    { cpu_perc,     " cpu: %s%% |", NULL },
    { battery_perc, " bat: %s%% |", NULL },

    <p>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Click on the blog tag “huskyai” to see all the posts, or visit the <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-walkthrough/">overview section</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-building-the-machine-learning-model/">previous post</a> we walked through the steps required to gather training data, build and test a model to build “Husky AI”.</p>
<p>This post is all about threat modeling the system to identify scenarios for attacks which we will perform in the upcoming posts.</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of moving pieces already in the “Husky AI” system that we built out.</p>
<p>To get started with identifiying security issues in a systematic way, I typically create a high-level Threat Model diagram using Microsoft Threat Modeling tool (or just on a piece of paper at times too).</p>
<p>The following is a picture the “Husky AI” threat model:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-threat-model.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-threat-model.png" alt="Husky AI Threat Model"></a></p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack, but if you read the previous posts around building and operationalizing a machine learning model the assets and their connections should make sense.</p>
<p>The threat modeling tool automatically proposes threats and it is quite thorough. It is actually common that engineers complain that the tool creates too much noise, and it takes too long to review. For instance, this threat model led to 96 threats initially that were automatically identified by the tool.</p>
<p>By clicking on a component in the threat modeling tool, we can view the specific threats for that particular asset. For example, this is the view for the web server:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/threatmodelingtool.jpg"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/threatmodelingtool.jpg" alt="Threat Modeling Tool Example"></a></p>
<p>Even though there is a large amount of threats, it is great because it highlights issues you might not think about, or not think about each time you perform threat modeling. However, it can be a bit of an overload, and threats are repetitive. There is really no requirement to use the tool - it’s just there to help.</p>
<p>When it comes to brainstorming and classifying threats, I use STRIDE. STRIDE is a threat classification technique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">developed by Microsoft</a>. It puts threats into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>S</strong>poofing</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>ampering</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>epudiation</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>enial of service</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>levation of privilege</li>
</ol>
<p>It is good approach to hold threat modeling sessions with engineers, those can be informal whiteboard sessions. Try to have at at least one threat in each category for every asset.</p>
<p><strong>It is not uncommon to forget about repudiation issues</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Repudiation</strong> is the issue of someone denying that they performed a certain action. How can you proof or disproof someone indeed updated a machine learning model in production for instance?</p>
<h3 id="perturbation-attacks">Perturbation Attacks</h3>
<p>When it comes to machine learning specific attacks most of them can be easily mapped to STRIDE categories. The one I had issues with are attacks that “query the model”, so called <strong>perturbation attacks</strong>. For the purpose of the threat model, I decided that this is a “spoofing” issue. An adversary tries to trick the algorithm to misclassify an image.</p>
<p>Now, let’s review the core assets of the Husky AI system, and brainstorm about attacks and mitigations.</p>

<p>The following section lists the core assets and threats that were identified during threat modeling. This information is ideally persistent in a bug tracking system, something like Jira.</p>
<p>Threats and mitigations are a moving target, something that was considered mitigated yesterday might not be mitigated anymore today. This is also were red teaming comes into the picture to help with the realization that every system has vulnerabilities that can be exploited - there is no such thing is a 100% mitigation.</p>
<p>Let’s look through the main assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training, Validation Images</li>
<li>Public facing REST API</li>
<li>Stored Machine Learning Model</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Bing API Key</li>
<li>SSH Access and Keys</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep the flow of the post, let’s filter them to the most interesting ones from machine learning point of view.</p>
<p>The full list of threats can be seen in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>. For anything I want to test, I added a <strong>“red team opportunity”</strong> note.</p>
<h2 id="identified-machine-learning-threats">Identified machine learning threats</h2>
<p>The following is the list of threats that I want to build attacks for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker brute forces images to find incorrect predictions/labels (dumb and smart ML fuzzing) - Perturbation</li>
<li>Attacker gains read access to the model</li>
<li>Attacker modifies persisted model file (backdoor and re-train)</li>
<li>Attacker denies modifying the model file</li>
<li>Attacker poisons the supply chain of third-party libraries</li>
<li>Attacker tampers with images on disk to impact training performance</li>
<li>Attacker modifies Jupyter Notebook file to insert a backdoor (key logger or data stealer)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a fairly good list with some interesting attack scenarios that we can research and perform.</p>
<p>There are other ML specific attacks such as model inversion, membership inference which I might explore at a later point, possibly when upgrading Husky AI to provide a more complex categorical model. For more information on machine learning threats see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/failure-modes-in-machine-learning">Failure modes in machine learning</a> by Microsoft, as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07658.pdf">Hacking Neural Networks - A short introduction</a> by Michael Kissner.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>In the next post, we will do hands-on attacks against the exposed prediction API via different brute force approaches.</p>
<p>Now it will become interesting! <strong>Stay tuned.</strong></p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>This appendix contains the most significant threats identified and more insights. When doing this you want to store this information in a issues/bug tracking system such as Jira. This helps to track and also review dispositions in the future.</p>

September 6, 2020 | https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>As developers, we frequently use keyboard shortcuts. Some enthusiasts know hundreds, others are contempt with the essential ones. But every developer does know some. It is unthinkable to browse the Web, searching for a solution to your CSS alignment problem without using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>. Debugging would be tedious if we couldn’t pause and resume a program’s execution with the keyboard.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, I have been able to significantly expand my keyboard shortcut knowledge with my new side-project web app <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a>.<br>
In particular, I knew only a few shortcuts for the web-based tools I am using in my daily work. This post describes how it took me less than 1 hour to learn <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 new key combinations</a>. Fortunately, KeyCombiner keeps a detailed history of a user’s learning progress, so that I could write this post retrospectively.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the 42 minutes of learning time was interrupted by breaks, and the process involved some other tasks, such as creating the collection of shortcuts I wanted to learn. However, I did, in fact, spend only 42 minutes practicing the shortcuts and have had similar results with other shortcut collections.</p>

<p>The first step to learning new keyboard shortcuts is to define which. I don’t think it is efficient to try and learn all shortcuts for a particular application. You will end up with many that you do not use in your daily work and that you will soon forget again.</p>
<p>Creating custom collections of keyboard shortcuts is perhaps the greatest strength of KeyCombiner and sets it apart from any other tool. Within minutes or less, you can have a personal collection by importing shortcuts from popular apps. I like to compare its approach to how you build playlists in music software. Instead of browsing your favorite artists’ albums, you browse categories of your favorite applications. Instead of adding songs to your playlists, you can add keyboard shortcuts to your collections.</p>
<p>For this challenge, I created a new collection named “<a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 to learn</a>”.
Then, I browsed KeyCombiner’s <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/">public collections</a> and started to import everything I wanted to learn. As my goal was to get better with web application shortcuts, I focused on the public collections for Gmail, GitHub, GDrive, Docs, Slack, and Twitter. Importing the combinations into my new shortcut collection looked like this:</p>

<p>Collecting shortcuts from KeyCombiner’s <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/56">public Gmail collection</a>.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, I added a few shortcuts for <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/">Smartgit</a> manually. It is a graphical Git client that I am using extensively. For some reason, I never learned its shortcuts. Unfortunately, KeyCombiner does not yet have a public shortcut collection for Smartgit that I could rely on. However, manual input does the job:</p>

</figure>
<p>You can browse the resulting collection with 50 keyboard shortcuts here: <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 to learn</a>.</p>
<p>I am afraid you will have to trust me that I did not know these shortcuts already before this experiment. However, as reassurance, you can check <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/a-collection-of-all-keyboard-shortcuts-i-use/">my previous blog post</a> covering all the shortcuts I was using until a few weeks ago. The list there does not include these new ones.</p>
<p>To validate the success of this experiment, I will simply use KeyCombiner’s confidence metric. It will analyze my performance and tell me which shortcuts are already etched into my muscle memory during practice. So, the challenge will be completed successfully once this card says <strong>50/50</strong>:</p>
<figure>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Learning new shortcuts with KeyCombiner is dead simple. You click on the practice button for a particular collection, and the software does the rest. It will create 60-seconds training exercises where you are supposed to type the shortcuts of a collection as fast and as correct as possible.</p>
<p>With every input, KeyCombiner remembers if it was correct and how long you took. It will use this information along with some machine learning to calculate a so-called confidence value for each key combination in your collections. A high confidence value means that you mastered a combination. Key combinations with a low value will occur more often in practice sessions, so you are not stuck repeating what you know already.
There are a few additional aspects to it, but the good thing is that users do not have to bother with the learning algorithm’s internal workings. Repeatedly doing practice runs is enough.</p>
<h2 id="starting-to-remember-the-keys">Starting to remember the keys</h2>
<p>The very beginning of learning a new collection is the hardest part. While I do not yet know any of the shortcuts, I have to rely on KeyCombiner’s delayed key hints to type any. Sometimes, I just skip combinations immediately to see what the keys are.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/practice-start.gif" alt="The very first practice runs with a new collection are quite slow."> <figcaption>

</figure>
<p>This is how results for such a practice run look like:</p>
<figure>

<p>Typical practice statistics for a collection you do not know yet.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Surprisingly, even in the first practice run, I got a couple of combinations right without key hints. This means that they occurred multiple times already or simply that I was able to guess them correctly. The latter is often the case for <em>go to</em> shortcuts, which have been made popular by Gmail and are now used in many web applications.</p>
<p>After a few practice runs, I started to disable key hints and only relied on skipping combinations where I couldn’t remember the keys. KeyCombiner will then display the skipped combination’s keys, so I have a shot at remembering them next time.</p>
<p>The statistics for the 10th practice run looked as follows:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after10.png" alt="After just 10 minutes of practice, I already know some of the shortcuts."> <figcaption>
<p>After just 10 minutes of practice, I already know some of the shortcuts.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>KeyCombiner recognizes 9 shortcuts as mastered. So far, so good.</p>
<h2 id="building-muscle-memory">Building muscle memory</h2>
<p>After another 10 practice runs, statistics showed that I knew already most of the shortcuts:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after20.png" alt="Statistics for my 20th practice run."> <figcaption>
<p>Statistics for my 20th practice run.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, KeyCombiner punishes errors quite heavily and is hesitant to show keys as mastered that I have just recently mistyped.
At this stage, it starts to get interesting to check the collection and see which specific shortcuts have very low confidence values. Usually, it is obvious to see some patterns:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after20-problems.png" alt="The combinations with lowest confidence values after 20 practice runs."> <figcaption>
<p>The combinations with lowest confidence values after 20 practice runs.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The figure shows that I had problems knowing which modifiers to use for GSuite shortcuts (Gmail, GDrive and Docs). Some use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> , some <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> and some don’t have a modifier at all (e.g. forwarding a mail in Gmail). I found that having a good look at such problems between practice runs can speed my progress, but it is not required.</p>
<p>All that is needed is to keep hitting the practice button. At this stage, muscle memory starts to build, and the average time I need for each combination goes down quickly. KeyCombiner considers the average time metric for its confidence values.</p>
<h2 id="completing-the-challenge">Completing the challenge</h2>
<p>After 35 practice runs, things started to look very good:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after35-lowest-confidence.png" alt="Only few shortcuts with low confidence values remain."> <figcaption>
<p>Only few shortcuts with low confidence values remain.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A confidence value of 3 means that I mastered a particular combination.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the combination with the lowest confidence value. Surprisingly, it is the relatively simple <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>:
</p><figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after35-shift-a.png" alt="Aggregated statistics for a specific combination."> <figcaption>
<p>Aggregated statistics for a specific combination.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A combination is not guaranteed to appear in every practice. Furthermore, it can appear multiple times, especially when it has a low confidence value compared to the other shortcuts of a collection. Consequently, the above figure shows only 11 practice runs but 15 correct occurences and 3 errors.</p>
<p>I made quite a few mistakes with this combination in the beginning. Therefore KeyCombiner’s algorithm is skill skeptical about my skills. Errors usually mean that I thought I knew the shortcut but then typed a wrong combination. In this case, I suspect it is because I was hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> instead or missing the <kbd>a</kbd> key. <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> is a bit tricky to type if you are used to hit both <kbd>shift</kbd> and <kbd>a</kbd> with your little finger. However, my performance has been much better recently. Just a couple more practice runs to go and KeyCombiner will forgive my earlier mistakes.</p>
<p>Then, finally, after another 7 practice runs, I had reached my goal:</p>

<p>Practicing on this collection looks much different now than in the beginning:</p>

<p>It is straightforward to do a similar challenge. Simply go to <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">https://keycombiner.com</a>, create an account, import some shortcuts from public collections, and start practicing. However, I would like to share some additional
tips that make learning new shortcuts more pleasant for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a bit more fun in the beginning if you throw in some shortcuts that you already know. Even better, just extend one of your existing collections with new shortcuts that you want to learn. KeyCombiner will automatically show the new ones more frequently during practice.</li>
<li>I sometimes activate key hints <em>without</em> delay, which brings some variety to the learning experience and can help build muscle memory. If you are a good typist, you will be able to type a lot of shortcuts within the 60 seconds time limit.</li>
<li>KeyCombiner will try to filter out shortcuts than cannot be captured during training. Those are marked with a yellow background in your collections. However, sometimes an invalid combination may still make it into your practice session, for example, if a browser extension does not pass it on to KeyCombiner. Simply append an underscore to any of the keys, e.g. <kbd>shift_</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>, so that KeyCombiner will recognize it as invalid.</li>
<li>Depending on how frequently use a shortcut in your daily work, your memory may fade over time. To counter this, I suggest practicing also mastered collections from time-to-time. A couple of one-minute practice sessions can be a nice break from work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have already learned many new keyboard shortcuts with KeyCombiner before this challenge. However, I never kept track of how long it took exactly until I knew them. I am thrilled with finding out that I could learn …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599368382956/xrewhMgqx.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>So far I have been writing Lambda function in Python for all my  AWS <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rajanpanchal">projects</a> . In Python its easy, just import boto3 module and starting coding. Things are bit different when you write Lambda handlers in Java. Lets explore and see how you can write a simple HelloWorld Lambda handler in java. I have planned couple of how-to projects that I am going to write in Java. Hence I thought to do HelloWorld post before we dive into complex handlers. Feel free to follow me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/PanchalRajan"> twitter</a>  for upcoming updates.</p>
<p>To implement handler, we are going to use Maven, Eclipse and AWS SDK for Java. Below are the version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java:  1.8</li>
<li>Eclipse:  Version: 2020-06 (4.16.0)</li>
<li>AWS SDK: 2.14.11</li>
<li>Maven: 3.6.3 (Included with eclipse)</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started, create a new empty maven project in eclipse. Go to File-&gt; New-&gt; Maven Project. In new project dialog box. select "create simple project" and hit next. On next screen. add appropriate information about the project and hit finish. For example:</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/aws-sdk-java/new-maven-project.PNG" alt="aws sdk java new maven project"> </p>
<p>Now your project is created. Open pom.xml and add following code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;net.rajanpanchal&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;lambda-java-demo&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Lambda-Java-Demo&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;HelloWorld Lambda handler in java&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;
        &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;
        &lt;aws.java.sdk.version&gt;2.14.11&lt;/aws.java.sdk.version&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
        &lt;dependencies&gt;
            &lt;dependency&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;software.amazon.awssdk&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;bom&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;${aws.java.sdk.version}&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
                &lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
            &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;/dependencies&gt;
    &lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;
    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.amazonaws&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;aws-lambda-java-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;

        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.code.gson&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;gson&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.8.6&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;configuration&gt;
                    &lt;source&gt;${maven.compiler.source}&lt;/source&gt;
                    &lt;target&gt;${maven.compiler.target}&lt;/target&gt;
                &lt;/configuration&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-shade-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;3.2.4&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;executions&gt;
                    &lt;execution&gt;
                        &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;
                        &lt;goals&gt;
                            &lt;goal&gt;shade&lt;/goal&gt;
                        &lt;/goals&gt;
                    &lt;/execution&gt;
                &lt;/executions&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We are setting some properties in <code>&lt;properties&gt;</code> tag like AWS SDK version and Java Version. We are adding AWS SDK dependency and Lambda core dependency with desired version. Google JSON dependency is added to convert between JSON and Java object and vice versa.
In plugins, we define maven compiler plugin to compile the code and another important plugin called <code>maven-shade-plugin</code>. This plugin helps to create <strong>fat jar</strong> a.k.a <strong>Uber jar</strong>. This jar will contain all the dependencies that are required to successfully run the lambda function.</p>
<p>Now lets create the handler. </p>
<pre><code><span>package</span> net.rajanpanchal.handlers;

<span>import</span> java.util.Map;

<span>import</span> com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;
<span>import</span> com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.LambdaLogger;
<span>import</span> com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler;
<span>import</span> com.google.gson.Gson;
<span>import</span> com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;

<span>public</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>HelloWorldHandler</span> <span>implements</span> <span>RequestHandler</span>&lt;<span>Map</span>&lt;<span>String</span>,<span>String</span>&gt;, <span>String</span>&gt;</span>{
      Gson gson = <span>new</span> GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
      <span>@Override</span>
      <span><span>public</span> String <span>handleRequest</span><span>(Map&lt;String,String&gt; event, Context context)</span>
      </span>{
        LambdaLogger logger = context.getLogger();
        String response = <span>new</span> String(<span>"200 OK"</span>);
        
        logger.log(<span>"ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: "</span> + gson.toJson(System.getenv()));
        logger.log(<span>"CONTEXT: "</span> + gson.toJson(context));
        
        logger.log(<span>"EVENT: "</span> + gson.toJson(event));
        logger.log(<span>"EVENT TYPE: "</span> + event.getClass().toString());
        <span>return</span> response;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Here were are implementing <code>RequestHandler</code> that will accept a <code>Map</code> of <code>String</code> and outputs a <code>String</code> response. The handler is not doing much. Just logging some stuff from <code>context</code> and <code>event</code>  and in response it sends <code>200 OK</code> string.
After this right click on project, go to 'Run as' and click 'Maven build'. A configuration window will open. In 'Goals' type <code>package</code> and hit 'Run' . Build should be successful and will create a fat jar in <code>target</code> folder.</p>
<p>Now go to AWS console and create a new Lambda function with Java 8 as runtime and upload this jar from <strong>Function Code</strong> section. To test this Lambda, create a test event and execute the test.
 <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/aws-sdk-java/test-event.PNG" alt="Java SDK Lambda Test Event"> </p>
<p>The ouput might look similar to this:</p>

	<p><small>September  6, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>A long time ago, Daniel J. Bernstein wrote a proposal for a new
generation of Internet email he called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a>, although it never went anywhere.
Ever since then, a significant number of people have idealized it
as the great white 'if only' hope of email (especially as the
solution to spam), in much the same way that people idealized Sun's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> as the great 'if only'
alternative to X11. Unfortunately, IM2000 is not actually a good
idea.</p>

<p>The core of <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a> is summarized by Bernstein as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>IM2000 is a project to design a new Internet mail infrastructure
around the following concept: Mail storage is the sender's
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first problem with this is that it doesn't remove the fundamental
problem of email, which is (depending on how you phrase it) that
email is an <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols"><em>anonymous push</em> protocol</a>
or that it lacks <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem"><em>revocable authorization</em> to send you things</a>. In IM2000, random strangers on the
Internet are still allowed to push to you, they just push less data
than they currently do with (E)SMTP mail.</p>

<p>The idea that IM2000 will deal with spam rests on the idea that
forcing senders to store mail is difficult for spammers. Even a
decade ago this was a questionable assumption, but today it is
clearly false. A great deal of serving capacity is yours for the
asking (and someone's credit card) in AWS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">GCP</a>, Azure, OVH,
and any number of other VPS and serverless computing places.  In
addition many spammers will have a relatively easy time with
'storing' their email, because their spam is already generated from
templates and so in IM2000 could be generated on the fly whenever
you asked for it from them. We now have a great deal of experience
with web servers that generate dynamic content on demand and it's
clear that they can run very efficiently and scale very well,
provided that they're designed competently.</p>

<p>(I wrote about this a long time ago <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageHelpsSpammers">here</a>, and things have gotten much
easier for spammers since then.)</p>

<p>At the same time, IM2000 is catastrophic for your email privacy.
People complain vociferously about 'tracking pixels' in HTML email
that betray when you open and read the email from someone; well,
IM2000 is one giant tracking pixel that reliably reports when and
where you read that email message. IM2000 would also be a terrible
email reading experience, because it's like a version of IMAP where
message retrieval has random delays and sometimes fails entirely.</p>

<p>(As far as spam filtering your incoming IM2000 messages goes, IM2000
gives you far less up front information than you currently get with
SMTP email. I wrote up this and other issues a long time ago in an
entry about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageProblems">the technical problems of such schemes</a>. Some of those problems are no longer
really an issue more than a decade later, but some continue to be.)</p>

<p>At a broader 'technical choices have social impacts' level, IM2000
would create a very different experience than today's email systems
if implemented faithfully, one where 'your' email was actually not
yours but was mostly other people's because other people are storing
it. Those other people can mostly retract individual messages by
deleting them from their servers (you would still have the basic
headers that are pushed to you), and they can wipe out large sections
of your email by deleting entire accounts (and the sent messages
associated with them), or even by going out of business or having
a data loss incident. Imagine a world where an ISP getting out of
the mail business means that all email that its customers have sent
from their ISP email accounts over the years just goes away, from
everyone's mailbox.</p>

<p>(If 'ISP' sounds abstract here, substitute 'Yahoo'. Or 'GMail'.)</p>

<p>In addition, in some potential realizations of IM2000, email would
become mutable in practice (even if you weren't supposed to in
theory), because once again the sender is storing the message and
is in a position to alter that stored copy. Expect that capability
to be used sooner or later, just as people silently revise things
posted on the web (including official statements, perhaps especially
including them).</p>

<p>Some of these social effects can be partially avoided by storing
your own local copies of IM2000 messages when you read them, but
there are two issues. The first is pragmatic; the more you store
your own copies and the earlier you make them, the more IM2000 is
SMTP in a bad disguise. The second is social; in the IM2000 world
the server holds the authoritative copy of the message, not you,
so if you say the message says one thing (based on your local copy)
and the server operator says it says something else (or doesn't
exist), the server operator likely wins unless you have very strong
evidence.</p>

<p>In general, I think that IM2000 or anything like it would create
an 'email' experience that was far more like the web, complete with
the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool messages changing</a>, than today's
email (where for better or worse you keep your own full record of
what you received, read and reread it at your leisure, and know
that it's as immutable as you want it to be). And it would still
have the problem that people can push stuff in front of you, unlike
the web where you usually at least have to go looking for things.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the pandemic hit global news, everyone (I presume) and especially on Twitter were sharing their predictions about the future.<br></p><p>Apart from the range of predictions from dark and gloomy to “it’s going to be alright soon” optimism, there was intense collective thought being shared on how to adjust to the new life.&nbsp;</p><p>A dangerous outside world with a potentially lethal virus, getting stuck indoors and hence being wrenched out of every routine and social habits, general anxiety and fear for yourself and your loved ones - didn’t stop people from sharing “if you don’t build your business ideas while you’re stuck indoors, you’ll never do it”. Or “this is the best time to become fit and the best version of yourself.”&nbsp;</p><p>You know, non-empathetic BS that treats human beings like a robot following a set of instructions.</p><p>I spent month 1 in anxiety and fear desperately trying to adjust to the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>By month 2, I’d figured out that to not go insane, I will have to block news, browsing Twitter, and any websites tracking the pandemic 12 times a day. And so I did. My mind felt wrinkled until I let go, and it felt like I could relax and breathe &nbsp;again.</p><p>In the same month, I thought I would adjust and “become the best version of myself” or whatever hustle porn phrase was trending that week. I failed at adjusting and living a “normal” life for several months. I stopped trying so hard.</p><p>It also dawned on me that while my problems are real, the people really facing a hard time are those from the lower economic strata. They don't just have an option to live indoors and "WFH". They can't quit their jobs and go home. I became grateful about my position and privilege in life and internally I stopped complaining to myself about how difficult life is during a pandemic. I became calm.</p><p>It’s month 7 and I think I finally got a grip on my life.</p><p>You see, building new routines and adjusting to new social normals is a long process. Sure, you can write it down on a piece of paper and try to follow it, but your body and mind aren’t fully aligned and adjusted.</p><p>In particular, I found being stuck within 4 walls and not talking to anyone other than my family members for months wasn't going to help me adjust to the new normal.</p><p>In June, I started writing. This was the first step towards normalcy as I finally got in touch with my thoughts again and found an outlet to express them.</p><p>And only in the last month, I created a routine around going downstairs for a long 45-min brisk walk (while wearing a mask and avoiding people like the plague). I also started scheduling a lot of calls whenever someone from my life reached out, just to catch up with them and behave like we would had we bumped into each other at a coffee shop.</p><p>Human beings are incredible at adapting to a situation and normalising it. Life is finally starting to feel normal again. It just takes time, in this case 7 &nbsp;months.</p><p>I can see this in other people too - their behaviours, their mood, what they are saying when you talk to them and what you see people talk about on Twitter and other social platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, I played <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=puertorico" target="_blank">Puerto Rico</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">Akash</a> in the afternoon. In the evening. I walked while listening and occasionally babbling with a group of people on <a href="https://leher.app/" target="_blank">Leher</a> (Clubhouse for India). It felt like a fun conversation we would have otherwise had over a beer had we met physically. At night, I joked and laughed around with college friends over a Zoom call. </p><p>Life felt normal.</p><p>While the pandemic is bigger than ever and it’s imperative that we continue following all safety guidelines, having a routine you follow everyday, going outdoors regularly, socialising with people on video or phone calls - helps me adjust to this life in a pandemic.</p></div></div>]]>

							<p>Fog clings to a never-ending row of low-rise buildings down the length of a dusty road, it’s early, around eight o’clock on a cool April morning. The fog clears and voices breakthrough and you see the first glimpses of the large bazaar, sounds of shutters slamming open, doors being unlocked and people greeting each other as their day starts. The occasional chatter of gunfire can be heard as firearms are test fired nearby.</p>
<p><em>Darra Adam Khel</em>. This bustling town is situated in modern-day <em>Pakistan</em>, a stone’s throw from the Pak-Afghan border. <em>What makes it so special?</em> You may ask and the answer lies within the myriad of myths and legends put out over the years.</p>

<p><span><iframe width="1160" height="653" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-f7j-RlN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As of this year, 2019, <em>Darra</em> is the last main tribal arms market and manufacturing town that remains in the Pak-Afghan FATA region (Federally-Administered Tribal Region – FATA pronounced Faa-Thaa locally), the last vestige of old-world freedom in the area. Over the last few years, the other manufacturing hubs and markets in towns like <em>Landi Kotal</em>, just a few minutes’ drive from <em>Torkham</em> border on the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, have finally died out leaving a handful of shops and a couple of gunsmiths who repair the large number of firearms still found across the region. <em>Peshawar’s</em> massive arms bazaars have also disappeared leaving a few licensed manufacturers in a small industrial estate on its outskirts and a few licensed dealers scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p><em>Darra</em> held out against the threat of the <em>Taliban</em> in the early 2010s, fighting them off on a number of occasions seeing as they had the arms, supplies and manpower to fend for themselves. They are no friend to these <em>Taliban</em> as you can see even though they have been linked by a few journalistic sources with selling them an enormous number of arms and ammunition. Contrary to popular belief that the market is now dead or not operating, the bazaar still thrives with many firearms bought and sold daily in its now-legendary bazaar. Yes, there were times were the shutters ere down but this was always just a façade, something that happened on the face and business continued in the back alleys and dusty basements.</p>
<p>However, the town of thousands of arms dealers and manufacturing workshops has been relegated to around a thousand of both due to the global war on terror and its impact on the global arms trade and international smuggling routes. They do not get as much as they used to though they still have a steady but small supply of items that get through to them even to this day. Due to this war on terror, the FATA area – which for many years managed to retain its autonomy, was regulated to prohibit the sale and ownership of explosive type ordnance and large-caliber arms such as HMG’s (e.g: DsHK / KPV) and up to the general population there. Fortunately, <em>Darra</em> still maintains its hold on the trade of tribal arms throughout the now regulated tribal areas and still holds a monopoly on arms manufactured there that are sold within <em>Pakistan</em> and <em>Afghanistan</em> too.</p>
<p>The war on terror has a lot of detriments with the main one being that it has increased the price of arms so much; that now an AK rifle which would have cost approximately Rs10,000 (~£55/~$67), around fifteen years ago, now costs a minimum of around ten times that. Yes, as with all markets, prices do fluctuate depending on many local and regional factors but prices still remain relatively high due to this. Genuine, original factory-made arms command a high premium on the market as a whole throughout the Pak-Afghan region and this has meant that locally made arms are sold more than originals due to the somewhat extortionate prices that can be seen. Due to soaring inflation and prices of raw material, locally made arms now cost the same as originals were only a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>Some older background information would be needed to understand why such a place even exists on such a scale as it is or even was. During the British Raj period of the 1800s where the British Empire ruled over these tribal areas, small workshops opened up in many areas across the region to produce exact copies of arms used by the British to fight back against them. Gunsmiths started with muskets and then progressed onto Lee-Enfield action rifles and that was their mainstay for a lengthy period continuing to upgrade and produce newer variations, turning those small shops into larger ones. That is how <em>Darra</em> and many other manufacturing towns and bazaars got their start and from then, the markets grew and grew becoming what they then were known as. <em>Darra’s</em> second major call to fame was that it supplied arms and ammunition to the <em>Mujahideen</em> in <em>Afghanistan</em> during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan War, some say it was even supported by the federal government too at this point. More recently, <em>Darra’s</em> notoriety came to surface as ill-informed people conducting poor journalism claimed it was a black market and that the gunsmiths manufactured guns in mud huts, with basic tools using their bare hands. Putting this to rest, let me start with calling it a black market; this is incorrect as the areas where these markets were/are based comes under its own tribal laws and governance much different to the rest of <em>Pakistan</em>, they are operating well within their own laws therefore it is not a black market in any sense within these borders. There is an element of truth to the thought of mud huts, bare hands and rudimentary methods but the times long past, when this was the norm, are not an indication of how things are in this day and age. Yes, some processes such as heat-treating and finishing are done in so-called mud huts and outdoors under makeshifts structures (this is much needed for ventilation) however the actual workshops are almost always in brick structures and the gunsmiths utilize milling machines, CNC machines and other tools to make their products. Yes, they do use basic tools but those are used to fit and finish the firearm and not to actually manufacture or produce it.</p>

<p>A negative misconception in regards to the firearms produced is the thought that they aren’t heat-treated or are of poor quality. This isn’t true for the most part as they do go through a heat-treating process, however the detractor is that the method of heat-treating leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the cheaper copies. Many users of lower quality copies complain of metal warping and deformation causing a firearm to become inoperable or dangerous to use, this is what leads to people surmising that all arms made in such areas are no good. This is an issue for lower quality copies, a lower quality firearm will have its flaws as it is not built using quality material and to the same tolerances as a firearm made to exact specs with all care taken in production. At the end of the day, you must repeat the same phrase to people who ask why a cheap item is no good; you get what you pay for – if you want a cheap item, you will get a cheap item that will end up having issues or breaking much like any cheap thing you buy.</p>
<p>Moving away from the negatives, let us talk about positives. Apart from the exquisite food that the food gurus cook up there, <em>Darra</em> is also famous for some of the firearms designs to come out of its shops – most notable is the infamous AKMSU which resides in the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. Even though that particular firearm could have been made elsewhere in FATA or <em>Afghanistan</em> by a number of other gunsmiths, it has been linked to <em>Darra</em> due to the town being the main source of arms for sale and the similar types of AK designed copies/modifications known to have come out of there. I could list an almost infinite number of firearms designs displaying their know-how such as the modified SKS made to resemble an AK, or the well-known 8mm bolt-action faux AK and even the more recent AK M4geries. Forget all of those firearms, the gunsmiths themselves are the ones to keep this market and tradition alive, it’s them you have to appreciate as without them there would be more-or-less nothing left of the industry. The ingenuity and skill they have has made <em>Darra</em> a household name throughout the region and extending to much of the world, even to those who are not versed on firearms.</p>

<p><em>Darra</em> has managed to stand against the tide of time and change in an increasingly connected world and holds its own against all odds but has still found a way to use newer technologies and retain its own methods &amp; procedures of manufacturing in its regular business. Even with all that, there is now news that changes things, FATA and Darra with it, will finally be incorporated into the neighboring <em>KPK</em> (<em>Khyber</em> <em>Pakhtunkhwa</em>) province of <em>Pakistan</em>. Regrettably, this means that their own tribal laws will now be abolished and government/regional laws and regulations will be implemented in its place there. The whole town’s industry will be made to register for licenses in either manufacturing or dealing sectors or be shut down. It is said that they will have easier access to raw materials and the costs of business will hopefully decrease, this is something that we can only hope does not destroy this historic industry. <em>Darra</em> will move into the new age with much newer equipment and tooling plus workshops and industrial estates that are planned to be built there and in other places with support of the current federal government of <em>Pakistan</em>. It is planned that arms manufactured there will be available to international markets via some …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

<blockquote>
<p>dcwr (don't care, won't read)
This project aims to make your entire blog contained in a single file (content sourced from where ever you want), of which you can do what ever you want via utilizing tools built in a community fashion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<pre><code>mkdir myblog &amp;&amp; <span>cd</span> myblog
npm i -g jsonblog-cli
blog init
blog build
blog serve
</code></pre>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I feel like I don't speak just for myself but over the years maintaining a blog has been rather arduous. I hate setting them up, I suck at keeping them alive, I dislike buying into platforms, I cannot seem to back them up and they are always way more than I actually needed.</p>
<p>Just recently I happened to stumble upon a Hacker News comment by Jedberg where he also listed his pain points with personal blogging which largely mirroed my own gripes. His comment and seeing the other trends wishing to relive the personal blogging era compelled me to attempt something.</p>
<p>Some readers might have realized already, but JSON Blog was inspired by another project that I co-founded a few years ago called JSON Resume. Essentially your resume is defined as formatted data which you are free to take anywhere you want and use community built tooling to analyze, render and host.</p>
<p>JSON Blog is at core a schematic simply to describe a blog, and I've spent some time developing some initial tooling to make it rather seamless to get started.
Here is a simple example (that generates this site)</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"site"</span>: {
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"My Blog"</span>,
    <span>"description"</span>: <span>"I write my thoughts here"</span>
  },
  <span>"basics"</span>: {
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Thomas Davis"</span>
  },
  <span>"posts"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"Introducing JSON Blog"</span>,
      <span>"source"</span>: <span>"https://gist.github.com/thomasdavis/db7db8d07ccb086504261802edf3069a/raw/introducing.md"</span>
    }
  ],
  <span>"pages"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"About"</span>,
      <span>"source"</span>: <span>"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thomasdavis/3e7eed3648f3a3e3d7b9a84d99fa1da762c5b880/about.md"</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>As with any schema, you might say that the naming conventions are terrible, and I'd agree. The reasoning behind any individual semantic choices might be rather complex so I can just tell you by what principles I chose these initial ones.</p>
<p>First, once you add anything to a schema, it cannot be removed without difficulty from the ecosystem. So I've only started with the bare essentials. There are some obvious additions to be made such as tags and categories but I've yet to define them for the second reason.</p>
<p>Schema's are only valubable in so far as person's will agree with them. (all reality is just consensus anyway jks). The success of a schema is dependent on if it is agreeable or not, therefore you need to have a bunch of differing opinions. So there is a schema repo, where anyone can chime in and some people will be elevated to arbiters. And those who debate will complain about lack of change, can't blame them, but change should be slow. And I won't pretend, that Me, the programmatic surgeon dictator won't have a final say. All I can say on that is that I've been consistenly wrong and;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak - Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The tools I've built are Javascript only but as a schematic the language of tooling is agnostic.</p>
<p><code>source</code> in the schema is meant to promote that a blog shouldn't care where you host your content, just make it a publically accessible URI, of which plenty of servies support Drive, Dropbox, Gist, pastbin</p>
<p>Essentially implying you can pass your <code>blog.json</code> to any function/company and they should be able to construct it. Which leads onto the concept of a <code>generator</code>;</p>
<h3>Generators</h3>
<p>A <code>generator</code> so far envisioned is a function that simply takes a <code>blog.json</code> and outputs an array of files and their content e.g.</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"files"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"index.html"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"&lt;h1&gt;I am a good person&lt;/h1&gt;"</span>
    },
    {
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"assets/logo.svg"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"&lt;svg version=\"1.1\"&gt;&lt;text&gt;Hello noob&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;"</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>generator</code> should then loop through the files, create directories and files where necessary and pipe in the <code>content</code>.</p>
<p>You can read more about generators at <a href="https://github.com/jsonblog/jsonblog-generator-boilerplate">https://github.com/jsonblog/jsonblog-generator-boilerplate</a></p>
<p>This entire project is still under development, but looking for feedback because I can't tell if it is a good idea.</p>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it. In the meantime, how are you going to ensure that you do not forget to implement the principles you have just learned?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <p><span>2020-04-02</span>

  

  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2020-04-02-library.jpg" alt="The Library of My Repos" title="The Library of My Repos"></p><p>I maintain several <a href="https://adamj.eu/projects/">open source Python projects</a>, each in its own GitHub repository.
I like to keep them all up to date according to a kind of template - similarity increases maintainability.</p>

<p>I have thought about putting them in a monorepo, but this would be unidiomatic and make it harder for contributors to join in.
A tool I discovered recently to make working with multiple repositories more like using a monorepo is <a href="https://myrepos.branchable.com/">myrepos</a>.</p>

<p>It allows you to run commands in multiple repositories, group the output by repository, and see a summary of successes/failures.
It’s a relatively simple tool - not much more than a complex invocation of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU parallel</a> - but its integration with VCS’s does sometimes come in useful.
It let me replace a flaky shell loop I was copy-pasting between uses.</p>

<p>It installs as the <code>mr</code> command, which has a bunch of subcommands.
The most useful one is <code>run</code>, to run arbitrary commands in each repository.</p>

<p>For example, to see git status in all repositories, you can run:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git status
<span>mr run: /Users/chainz/Documents/Projects/apig-wsgi
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.


nothing to commit, working tree clean


mr run: /Users/chainz/Documents/Projects/django-cors-headers
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.


nothing to commit, working tree clean


</span><span>...
</span><span>
mr run: finished (19 ok)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(Output cropped because I have 19 repositories!)</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>You can install myrepos from most package managers (<a href="https://myrepos.branchable.com/install/">docs</a>).
On macOS I installed it with <code>brew install myrepos</code>.</p>

<p>You then need to register your repositories by <code>cd</code>ing to their folder and running <code>mr register</code>.
This adds them to the default configuration file <code>~/.mrconfig</code>.</p>

<p>I added one change to my configuration file, to make 8 jobs to run in parallel by default:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[DEFAULT]</span>
<span>jobs</span> <span>=</span> <span>8</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Most of the changes I make are parallel-safe and this gives quite a speed boost.
You can switch back to serial for a single command with <code>--jobs 1</code> before the subcommand.</p>

<p>There is some documentation on the <a href="https://myrepos.branchable.com/">home page</a> and more on the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/myrepos/mr.1.en.html">man page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="example-change-check-manifest">Example Change: check-manifest</h2>

<p>myrepos has saved me a heaps of time and reduced errors for many different changes on my projects.
For example, recently I wanted to update the <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files in all my repositories.
This controls which files are added to the built Python packages.
I also wanted to run the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/"><code>check-manifest</code> tool</a> in my projects’ testing environments, to ensure their <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files were correct.</p>

<p>I started by <code>cd</code>’ing to one of my smaller projects, and figuring out the steps that would do this.</p>

<p>First, I looked through the files and manually made the necessary edits.
I then converted them to equivalent shell commands, like <code>rm</code> and <code>sed</code>.
I then copied those into a shell script I called <code>add-check-manifest.sh</code>, placed in my <code>~/scripts</code> folder, which is on my <code>$PATH</code> so myrepos can use it.</p>

<p>I iterated on the script by resetting the repository and rerunning the script, until it worked all the way through.
The final version was this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
<span>set</span> <span>-e</span>


<span>rm </span>MANIFEST.in
<span>echo</span> <span>'global-exclude *.py[cod]
graft tests
prune __pycache__
prune requirements
include HISTORY.rst
include LICENSE
include README.rst
exclude .editorconfig
exclude pyproject.toml
exclude pytest.ini
exclude tox.ini'</span> <span>&gt;</span> MANIFEST.in
<span>cd </span>requirements
<span>echo</span> <span>"check-manifest ; python_version == '3.8.*'"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> requirements.in
<span>sort </span>requirements.in <span>-o</span> requirements.in
./compile.sh
<span>cd</span> ..
<span>sed</span> <span>-E</span> <span>-i</span> <span>''</span> <span>-e</span> <span>'s/    multilint/    multilint\
    check-manifest/g'</span> tox.ini
tox <span>-r</span> <span>-e</span> py38-codestyle
git switch <span>-c</span> check-manifest
git add <span>--all</span>
git commit <span>-m</span> <span>"Test MANIFEST.in with check-manifest"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I used <code>set -e</code> so the shell script would <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/821396/aborting-a-shell-script-if-any-command-returns-a-non-zero-value">fail after the first error</a>.</li>
  <li>The first two commands replace the <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file to a new basic template - enough for many of my projects.</li>
  <li>The <code>cd</code> into requirements is for updating the test requirements. I use <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools">pip-tools’ <code>pip-compile</code></a> to manage these.</li>
  <li>The <code>sed</code> command injects the call to <code>check-manifest</code> in the test runs.</li>
  <li>The <code>tox</code> command runs the tests.
<code>check-manifest</code> would fail the run on projects that the <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file needed editing on.</li>
  <li>The final <code>git</code> commands create a new branch and commit the changes.
I left pushing to GitHub pull request for later.</li>
</ul>

<p>I knew it wouldn’t work perfectly on all the repositories, but it was much faster than making all these changes manually.</p>

<p>I then ran it across all repositories with <code>mr run add-check-manifest.sh</code>.
<code>tox</code> failed on a few, as I expected, so I went and patched them individually.</p>

<p>After each repository was ready, I ran another script I have <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/chainz-scripts/blob/master/pushupr">called <code>pushupr</code></a>.
This pushes a branch and creates a GitHub pull request for it using <a href="https://github.com/github/hub">GitHub’s <code>hub</code></a>.
I then needed CI to pass on all the PR’s, to be sure, so I took a break to go get on with life.</p>

<p>When I came back to my computer later, all the PR’s had passed.
I tabbed through all the pull requests and hit the merge buttons.</p>

<p>I could then run a few myrepos commands to pull those locally and clean up the branches:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git checkout master
<span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git pull <span>--prune</span>
<span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git branch <span>-D</span> check-manifest</code></pre></figure>

<p>Writing the script took a little initial investment, but saved me an hour or two of work.
In fact, without it, I would probably have never have bothered to do such a mundane task across all my projects.
A great example of automation as an enabler!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Computer Programming can be hard , can be complex to understand for some people, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be fun. From the beginning , programming languages were in English , well most of them except some special languages. But I have designed a programming language which let’s people program in Cats’ language, Mew Mew Mew. Which despite being a esoteric language is very much usable , and let’s programmers create complex program. I
also have conducted a small study to find real world use cases of MewMew programming language.</p>



<p>Programming in Cats’ language , it is lunacy or what? But it’s reality. With MewMew one can program in cats’ language, but it is not actually the cats’ language but the human interpretation of cats’ language , mew mew mew.
MewMew is an esoteric programming language built with ANTLR4 and C++. It is not intended to be used for commercial or mainstream programming instead , it was designed to be learning project for me or any other novice language designer who want get started building their own programming language.
While majority of programming languages are in English or I should say human languages but this language intends to be one of the first language to be in ‘non-human’ (not technically) language.</p>



<p>MewMew is implemented using ANTLR4 and C++. Though using Dynamically typed host language would be given me more flexibilty designing the language, I chose to use a statically typed for a multiple reasons , First it is fast. Second , the language becomes much more runtime safe. When experimenting with early prototypes , I tried Python and PLY (Python Lex and Yacc) , Tatsu and even Flex &amp; Bison. Python and PLY was not chosen because it was too much slow , even Cythonzing didn’t give advantage. Tatsu was kind of better than PLY but again speed issue, and Flex &amp; Bison , I didn’t chose them because of their over complexity , a language small as MewMew required a huge codebase. Finally I setteled for ANTLR4 , It was comparativaly fast thanks to its ALL(*) algorithm , on top of that the API of it was very easy to catch on but also very robust.
When Designing MewMew , I left some places which can be used to improve or extend the language in future.</p>

<p>MewMew doesn’t use any traditional numbers (0 to 9) instead it uses ‘mew’s. For example , ‘mew’ will get converted to 1 , ‘mewmew’ will get converted to 2  , ‘mewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmew’ will get converted to 10 and so on so forth but zero has special case , to get only zero one can use ‘mew-mew’.
MewMew also has few operator similar to C++, which are discussed in GitHub project repository README. MewMew is all about numbers, it doesn’t contain any other types such as strings , chars , arrays etc , which keeps the language lightweight. Every number in mewmew is a floating point number.
MewMew also has if , if else and a repeat loop aka. Meow loop expression. It also has a special type of function called scratch function which open the door of extending the language in future. Syntax of if statement is something like Expression ? Statements ; where ‘Expression’ takes any type of expression , on Truthy value the ‘Statements’ will get executed. Similar to that Expression ? Statements1 : Statements2 ; is the syntax of if-else statement, if the value of ‘Expression’ is truthy the ‘Statements1’ will get executed else ‘Statement2’ will get executed. The syntax of meow loop is something like this @ Expression : Statements; the ‘Statements’ will get executed N times where N = Expression. Scratch function syntax is something like #(Expression) where ‘#’ can be repeated from 1 to many times. But as of 5 functions are defined only.</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison of some simple program written in MewMew and C++ :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>In MewMew</th>
      <th>In C++</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@#####(mew):<br>m % mewmew == mew – mew ?<br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%2 == 0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@####(mew):<br>m % mewmewmew == mew – mew &amp; m % ###(mew) == mew – mew ? <br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; m%5==0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>MewMew is an esoteric language which is morelike a joke than a commercial language. It was created to be a leaning project for which it has done successfully. In future it also might work as an reference to learning language designing for future.With the scratch function it opens new doors forexpanding the language in future. It will only took a few lines of code in switch…case statement to add a new function.</p>

    <h3>PDP 11/70 Emulator - v3.1 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
      This emulator came about because years ago I was a programmer for RSTS/E on a PDP 11/45 and had admired the console idle loop light pattern - but I couldn't quite remember how it looked. Given the unavailability of real systems it became time to write
      an emulator!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to start with a PDP 11/45 emulator but the extra memory of a PDP 11/70 became far too attractive (a whole 4MB!). It took some time before I finally produced a
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11-45.html">PDP 11/45</a> version.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met my core objective - I can now see the RSTS/E console light pattern that I was looking for, and found that newer versions (eg v9.6) have a different light pattern. Also I have now seen some of the light patterns for other OSes. RSX and BSD 2.11
      have their own different patterns and Unix V5 and Ultrix operate with absolute minimum light movement (I'm assuming they operates mostly in WAIT mode).
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting all of the operating systems used here presents its own set of challenges - one of which is finding the software in the first place. But one of the most interesting was RSTS/E V06C which has its own
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/RSTSv06c.html">story</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The boot code in this emulator is a custom PDP 11 program running with it's own set of light patterns. It is initially loaded at address 140000 and has a LIGHTS command which operates by mapping and executing a WAIT instruction from a pattern of virtual addresses located in Supervisor
      mode. You can also use the BOOT command to start one of the guest operating systems listed below, or the ODT command to start a version of the Octal Debugging Tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However boot code like this was not part of early PDP 11s. These systems had no BIOS or other software to help get the bare metal started. If you were lucky perhaps the previous boot code would still be intact in non-volatile magnetic core memory, but in general booting the system required toggling in a small bootstrap loader from the front panel. There are listings of bootstrap loaders for various devices
      <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/psychology/pdp-11/bootstraps.html">here</a>.
      If you are a purist don't use the boot code! Instead find the bootstrap code for the device you want to boot from and toggle it in through the switches. However be warned - the boot program will not work unless toggled in perfectly which often takes a few goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of the switch commands for booting from an RK05 where the value at address 1002 selects the unit number (rk0, rk1, rk2, etc). Goodluck!
    </p>
    <pre><b>

    <p>
      If you wish to toggle in a simple light chaser to the front panel then here are some switch commands which can be used:
    </p>
    <pre><b>

</b>
                            HALT, 001000, LOAD ADDRESS

                            001000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
To restart the initial boot code (if it has not been overwritten) use the switch commands:
    <pre>HALT, 140000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
    <p>
      If you plan to run the emulator repeatedly or for a project, consider downloading the emulator to your own machine or server.
      This will <b>significantly</b> speed any of the emulator disk accesses and response times. All files and emulator OS
      disks can be found in the top level folder of
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/">http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/</a></b> or in the zip file
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.zip">pdp11.zip</a></b> Please note that browser security
      policy may prevent local emulator pages from booting disk images so please read the information in <b>StartChrome.cmd</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in how the emulator works then you can browse the source files on
      <b><a href="https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js">Github</a></b>.
      The main Javascript files are pdp11.js, fpp.js and iopage.js
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many PDP emulators out there and I have never seen what I consider to be a complete list. Some of the really interesting ones can be found by googling terms such as "vhdl pdp 11". However the gold standard is SIMH at
      <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">Trailing Edge</a>.
      A different approach to Javascript PDP 11 emulation can be found at
      <a href="http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pdp11/">www.pcjs.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the first PDP 11 emulator would be SIM-11 written in FORTRAN before the first PDP 11/20 hardware was even built - see
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html"> How the PDP-11 Was Born</a>. There is more PDP 11 history at
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/main.html">www.hampage.hu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if you want your own PDP 11/70 front panel you might consider a

    <p>C++ modules are slated to be the biggest change in C++ since its inception.
The design of modules has several essential goals in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Top-down isolation</strong> - The â€œimporterâ€� of a module cannot affect the content
of the module being imported. The state of the compiler (preprocessor) in the
importing source has no bearing on the processing of the imported code.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom-up isolation</strong> - The content of a module does not affect the state
of the preprocessor in the importing code.</li>
  <li><strong>Lateral isolation</strong> - If two modules are imported by the same file, there
is no â€œcross-talkâ€� between them. The ordering of the import statements is
insignificant.</li>
  <li><strong>Physical encapsulation</strong> - Only entities which are explicitly declared as
exported by a module will be visible to consumers. Non-exported entities
within a module will not affect name lookup in other modules (barring some
possible strangeness with ADL. Long storyâ€¦)</li>
  <li><strong>Modular interfaces</strong> - The current module design enforces that for any
given module, the entire public interface of that module is declared in a
single TU called the â€œmodule-interface unitâ€� (MIU). The implementation of
subsets of the module interface may be defined in different TUs called
â€œpartitions.â€�</li>
</ol>

<p>If youâ€™ve been hoping for modules for as long as many have, youâ€™ll note that
â€œcompilation speedâ€� is missing from this list. Nevertheless, this is one of the
biggest promises of modules. The possible speedup from modules is merely a
consequence of the above design aspects.</p>

<p>This author can identify several aspects of C++ compilation that can greatly
benefit from the design of modules. In order of most-to-least-obvious:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tokenization caching</strong> - Because of TU isolation, tokenizing a TU can be
cached when the module is later imported into another TU.</li>
  <li><strong>Parse-tree caching</strong> - Same as above. Tokenization and parsing are some of
the most expensive operations in compiling C++. In my own tests, parsing can
consume up to 30% of compilation time for files with a large preprocessed
output.</li>
  <li><strong>Lazy re-generation</strong> - If <code>foo</code> imports <code>bar</code>, and we later make changes to
the <em>implementation</em> of <code>bar</code>, we may be able to omit recompilation of <code>foo</code>.
Only changes to <em>the interface</em> of <code>bar</code> necessitate recompilation of <code>foo</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Template specialization memoization</strong> - This one is a bit more subtle and
may take more work to implement, but the potential speedups are <em>enormous</em>.
In short: A specialization of a class or function template appearing in the
module interface unit can be cached and loaded from disk later.</li>
  <li><strong>Inline function codegen caching</strong> - Codegen results for inline functions
(including function templates and member functions of class templates) can
be cached and later re-loaded by the compiler backend.</li>
  <li><strong>Inline function codegen elision</strong> -  <code>extern template</code> allows the compiler
to omit performing codegen for function and class templates. This is hugely
beneficial for the <em>linker</em> when it performs de-dup. Modules may allow the
compiler to perform more <code>extern template</code>-style optimizations implicitly.</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, itâ€™s looking pretty good, yeah?</p>

<p>But thereâ€™s something missing. A horrible, terrible, no-good, very bad flaw.</p>



<p>Fortran implemented a module system that bears a slight resemblance to the
design proposed for C++. A few short months ago, a paper
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1300r0.pdf">p1300</a>
was written by the SG15 group for review in San Diego. As far as I can tell,
the paper was not discussed nor reviewed by any relevant eyes.</p>

<p>The gist of it is this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have module <code>foo</code> and module <code>bar</code>, defined by <code>foo.cpp</code> and <code>bar.cpp</code>
respectively.</li>
  <li><code>bar.cpp</code> has an <code>import foo;</code> statement.</li>
  <li>How do we make sure that <code>import foo</code> will resolve when compiling <code>bar.cpp</code>?
The current design and implementations require there to exist what is known
as the â€œbinary module interfaceâ€� (abbreviated as BMI) defined for <code>foo</code>. The
BMI is a file on the filesystem that describes the exported interface of the
module <code>foo</code>. Iâ€™ll call that BMI <code>foo.bmi</code> for now. The extension isnâ€™t
important.</li>
  <li>Creation of <code>foo.bmi</code> is a byproduct of the compilation of <code>foo.cpp</code>. When
compiling <code>foo.cpp</code>, the compiler will emit a <code>foo.o</code> and <code>foo.bmi</code>.
As a consequence of this design, <code>foo.cpp</code> <strong>must</strong> be compiled <em>before</em>
<code>bar.cpp</code>!</li>
</ol>

<p>If alarm bells arenâ€™t ringing already, let me discuss the way we currently work
using header files:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have a â€œmoduleâ€� <code>foo</code> defined by <code>foo.cpp</code> and <code>foo.hpp</code>, and a â€œmoduleâ€�
<code>bar</code> defined by <code>bar.cpp</code> and <code>bar.hpp</code>. Easy to understand.</li>
  <li><code>bar.cpp</code> contains an <code>#include &lt;foo.hpp&gt;</code> preprocessor statement.</li>
  <li>How do we make sure that <code>#include &lt;foo.hpp&gt;</code> resolves when compiling
<code>bar.cpp</code>? Itâ€™s simple: Make sure <code>foo.hpp</code> is present in a directory on the
header search path list. We do not need to do any additional pre-processing.</li>
  <li>There is no ordering requirement between the compilation of the â€œmodulesâ€�
<code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>. They can be processed in parallel.</li>
</ol>

<p>Parallelization is probably the single most important aspect of increasing
build performance. At this point, it isnâ€™t even something you think about when
you are optimizing your build because <em>it is already there</em>.</p>

<p>Modules change that. The importing of a module creates a â€œhappens-beforeâ€�
dependency where <code>#include</code> did not. (I discuss this ordering in my <a href="https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2018/12/20/build-like-ninja-1.html">Building
Like (a) Ninja post</a>).</p>

<p>The consequences of this design were explored very recently by Rene Rivera in
<a href="https://bfgroup.github.io/cpp_tooling_stats/modules/modules_perf_D1441R1.html"><em>Are modules fast?</em></a>.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: No. Or, more accurately: Itâ€™s subtle, but mostly <em>no</em>. The
current module implementation used in that paper is extremely primitive but is
still a valuable benchmark to understand what modules may look like
performance-wise. Expectedly, as hardware parallelism increases, headersâ€™ lead
over modules becomes more and more pronounced. There is also a relationship
between the DAG-depth (i.e. The length of the chain of modules that <code>import</code>
each other). As this depth increases, modules grow slower and slower, while
headers remain fairly constant for even â€œextremeâ€� depths approaching 300).</p>



<p>Suppose I have this source file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>greetings</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>iostream</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>greeting</span><span>::</span><span>english</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pretty simple. Since we import some modules, we will need to compile
<code>greetings</code> and <code>std.iostream</code> <em>before</em> we can compile this file.</p>

<p>So, letâ€™s do thatâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>Uhâ€¦</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve been given a source file with two imports. Thatâ€™s it. We donâ€™t have
anything else. Where is <code>greetings</code> defined? We need to find a file that
contains a <code>module greetings;</code> statement.</p>

<p>This file located on the other side of the galaxy, <code>talk.cpp</code>, looks promising:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span><span>;</span>

<span>#ifdef FROMBULATE
#include &lt;hello.h&gt;
#endif
</span>
<span>#ifndef ABSYNTH
</span><span>export</span> <span>module</span> <span>something</span><span>.</span><span>pie</span><span>;</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
<span>import</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>greeting</span> <span>{</span>

<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>english</span><span>();</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It defines that <code>greeting::english</code> function that we want. But how do we know
that this is the right file? It doesnâ€™t contain a <code>module greetings;</code> line!</p>

<p>But it does. Sometimes. It turns out when we compile with <code>-DFROMBULATE</code>, then
the file <code>hello.h</code> is pasted into the source file. Whatâ€™s in there?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#ifdef __SOME_BUILTIN_MACRO__
# define MODULE_NAME greetings
#else // Legacy module name
# define MODULE_NAME salutations
#endif
</span>
<span>export</span> <span>module</span> <span>MODULE_NAME</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Oh no.</p>

<p>This is fine. This is fineâ€¦ Donâ€™t worry. All we need to do isâ€¦ <em>run the
preprocessor</em> to check if the file comes out as <code>module salutations</code> or <code>module
greetings</code>.</p>

<p>This is okay, butâ€¦ There are 4,201 files that could define modules that can
be imported, and any one of them could be <code>module greetings;</code></p>

<p>Also, we canâ€™t use our own implementation of the preprocessor: We need to run
<em>exactly</em> the preprocessor that will be compiling this code. See that
<code>__SOME_BUILTIN_MACRO__</code>? We have no clue what that is. If we donâ€™t get it
<em>exactly</em> right, the compilation will fail, or, even worse, we may <em>miscompile</em>
the file.</p>

<p>So what can we do? We could cache the names of all the modules after
preprocessing all the files, right? Well, where do we store that mapping? And
what happens when we want to compile with a different compiler that results in
a different mapping? What if we add new files that need to be scanned? Do we
need to search every directory that contains these thousands of source files
every time we build, just to check if any modules were added, removed, or
renamed? On systems where process startup and/or filesystem access is not cheap,
these costs will add up.</p>



<p>These two problems are distinct but related in that I (and many others) believe
that one change to the modules design will fix them both: <strong>Module interface
unit locations must be deterministic</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two alternative ideas to enforce this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Force MIU filenames to derive from the moduleâ€™s name. This mimics the design
of header filenames being directly related to how they are found from an
<code>#include</code> directive.</li>
  <li>Provide a â€œmanifestâ€� or â€œmappingâ€� file that describes the filepath to an
MIU based on the module name. This file will need to be user-provided, or we
are back in the scanning problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>With MIU lookup deterministic and easily defined, we can then go to the next
essential step: The BMI of a module must be lazily generated.</p>

<p>The compilation ordering between TUs will kill module adoption dead in its
tracks. Even relatively shallow DAG depths are much slower than the equivalent
with header files. The only answer is that TU compilation <em>must</em> be
parallelizable, even in the face of importing other TUs.</p>

<p>In this respect, C++ would be best to mimic Pythonâ€™s <code>import</code> implementation:
When a new <code>import</code> statement is encountered, Python will first find a source
file corresponding to that module, and then look for a pre-compiled version in
a deterministic fashion. If the pre-compiled version already exists and is
up-to-date, it will be used. If no pre-compiled version exists, the source file
will be compiled and the resulting bytecode will be written to disk. The
bytecode is then loaded. If two interpreter instances encounter the same
un-compiled source file at the same time, they will race to write the …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>

<meta name="twitter:title" content="3 Programming Books for Beginner to Read in 2020">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Programming books can help you level up as a Developer, especially when you are getting started in Software Development or learning a new language.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.datastuff.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/library-869061_640.jpg">
<p>Be it an O’Reilly book, or some of the Computer Science classics, many <strong>programming books</strong> can help you level up in your <strong>career as a Developer</strong>. </p>
<p>This can be especially important when you are <strong>getting started</strong> in Software Development, or in a <strong>programming language</strong> like Python.</p>
<p>These last months have been quite heavy and stressful for many of us, what with the Apocalypse taking place and all that. </p>
<p>So why not take advantage of the situation, and use our newfound free time to double down on our studies and read some programming books?</p>
<p>This may be the time to be twice as productive. As <a href="http://paulgraham.com/gh.html?viewfullsite=1">Paul Graham</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects (…), and in return, you’ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, let’s see book number 1.</p>
<h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-2nd-ebook/dp/B07VSXS4NK/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Automate+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python&amp;qid=1587355901&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=f895004eb4c2d8493cba066d43e4b256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwPi');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07VSXS4NK&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B07VSXS4NK" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>If you’re new to programming, there’s this very early stage when you’re still realizing the <strong>huge potential software can have</strong>, especially when applied to <strong>automation</strong>. </p>
<p>There’s a big difference between performing a simple task manually, and doing it a thousand times faster with a script.</p>
<p>There’s also a case to be made that <strong>Python is the best language to get started</strong> with Software Development, since its syntax and environments can be less daunting than C or Java. This way, you can spend less time doing this kind of “set up” things, freeing you up to focus on what’s important: solving actual problems.</p>
<p>I think <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> really sets itself apart from other programming books in this area: showing you from the get-go which <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/pythons-list-comprehensions-uses-and-advantages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typical day-to-day problems you can solve with Python scripts</a>, or with code, really. </p>
<p>From basic program flow and logic to more advanced tasks like <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/how-to-scrape-the-web-using-python-with-scrapy-spiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Scraping</a>, this book walks with you <strong>all the way from beginner to proficient</strong>, without holding your hand too much.</p>
<p>My favorite project from that book is the one on the chapter <strong><em>Handle the Clipboard Content</em></strong>, which teaches you how to copy and paste text programmatically, eventually making a <em>super-clipboard</em> which stores more than one text.</p>
<p>I have a personal attachment to this book, as I used it to learn Python when I was still in high school, deciding on whether to study Computer Science or not.</p>
<p>If you work in an office and you’re thinking of <strong>pivoting into programming</strong>, this book is for you.</p>
<p>Here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Press-Thomas-Cormen-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=cormen&amp;qid=1587356486&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=09fe74bb316b42a1559a9377aabc1f17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormeni');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B007CNRCAO&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007CNRCAO" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>To every Computer Science student, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormen');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is our bible.</p>
<p>This book has been <strong>sitting on my shelf for years</strong>. </p>
<p>It has helped me <strong>prepare for many exams</strong>, or whenever I need to <strong>brush up on Data Structures</strong> before an interview.</p>
<p>Especially if you’re planning to get into Software Development without getting a college degree, this book is a definite must-read.</p>
<p>This Computer Science book is the most comprehensive study of basic <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> you will find. </p>
<p>It covers:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Algorithmic Complexity</strong> (with the best explanation of Big-O notation I’ve seen so far).</li><li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong> (<em>many</em> sorting algorithms).</li><li><strong>Graphs</strong> and Graph-related Algorithms (especially Binary trees).</li><li><strong>Hash tables</strong> and hashing algorithms.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>, Greedy Algorithms, <strong>Divide-and-Conquer</strong> Algorithms.</li></ul>
<p>These topics and many others are explained in understandable terms, but with <strong>mathematical rigor and correctness</strong>. Not only that, but they often come up both in <strong>day-to-day work</strong>, and in <strong>interview problems</strong>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is a university level book, packed full with formal proofs and mathematical notation. </p>
<p>Even so, I think most developers will agree it is <strong>generally entertaining to read </strong>(<em>if you don’t find Data Structures fun, make sure you’re picking the right career!</em>), and explains most concepts really clearly and succinctly.</p>
<p>If you need to learn how a hash table works, or want to be able to build a binary search tree from scratch, or just need a quick brush up on sorting algorithms before an interview, this is the book for you.</p>
<p>As before, here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/Cormen');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<p>And, speaking of interviews…</p>
<h2>Cracking the Code Interview</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ctci&amp;qid=1587356024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=904a242e267cc92cfb582e366ee3e63a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCIi');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0984782850&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=0984782850" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>Ok, hear me out here. If you’re starting from scratch, I think <a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwP');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-="">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> is the most practical way to start learning Python and programming.</p>
<p>And if you want to <strong>dive deeper</strong> and learn more advanced or theoretical Computer Science concepts, like Algorithms and Data Structures, then <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi">Cormen’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is the undisputed book to go.</p>
<p>However, when all is said and done, there is a craftsmanship that you can only learn by doing, and practicing.</p>
<p>As Charles Darwin once said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If that’s the stage where you feel you’re at, then the best thing you can do is <strong>practice a lot</strong>, with <strong>many different problems</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCI');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> (CTCI, for friends) has to offer.</p>
<p>Sure, the first chapter deals more with the “soft” aspects of a Software Interview (which, again, if you plan to apply for a SWE job eventually, then you should master those too!).</p>
<p>But the rest of the book? Chapter after chapter of <strong>fun, challenging problems</strong> taken straight out of Google’s, Microsoft’s or Facebook’s interview processes. And, they are divided into categories so you can practice one subject at a time.</p>
<p>Feel like you need to polish your <strong>bit manipulation</strong> skills? CTCI has a chapter for you.</p>
<p>Want to practice thinking on your feet and deciding which <strong>Data Structures</strong> fit each kind of problem setup? CTCI has you covered, too.</p>
<p>I did feel my <strong>Software Interview skills</strong> improved after reading CTCI and going through all its exercises. However, that’s definitely not the most important part. The most valuable thing I got from CTCI, is practice: hands-on practice, solving many different problems through code.</p>
<p>To get started, be sure to check out <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CTCIf');" data-cf-modified-9b2b10b971cfd35d4825f4b4-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> on Amazon.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So far, I’ve made recommendations for:</p>
<ul><li>A very language-focused programming book for your first steps as a Developer.</li><li>A more academic or broader book for the more theoretically-oriented readers.</li><li>A last, very practical book with a lot of exercises for everyone, old and new to coding.</li></ul>
<p>Each of these programming books has helped me learn a lot. Some have saved my skin on more than one occasion -or exam!-. </p>
<p>When I am preparing for an interview, or a tough exam, there are no other books I’d rather have <em>(though, if you read this far and are thinking ‘hey, he didn’t mention &lt;book_name&gt;!’ this is your time to shine! Hit me up in the comments and I’ll make sure to add it to my reading list)</em>.</p>
<p>I hope at least some of these books will be as helpful to you or your programmer friends, too!</p>
<p>Have you already read any of these books? Are you reading any of them? Let me know what you think of them in the comments! </p>
<p>I’d love to know your opinion, both if you liked them or not. Especially if you can offer a recommendation for what you think is a better alternative!</p>

<meta name="twitter:title" content="Feature Visualization on Convolutional Neural Networks (Keras)">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Feature Visualization is a way to interpret what each filter is doing in a Convolutional Neural Network, and which kinds of images it is learning to detect.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.datastuff.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped_block.jpg">
<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">apophenia</a> is <em>“the tendency to mistakenly perceive connections and meaning between unrelated things”</em> . It is also used as “the human propensity to seek patterns in random information”. Whether it’s a scientist doing research in a lab, or a conspiracy theorist warning us about how “it’s all connected”, I guess people need to feel like we understand what’s going on, even in the face of clearly random information.</p>
<p>Deep Neural Networks are usually treated like “black boxes” due to their <strong>inscrutability</strong> compared to more transparent models, like XGboost or <a href="https://github.com/interpretml/interpret">Explainable Boosted Machines</a>.</p>
<p>However, there is a way to interpret what <strong>each individual filter</strong> is doing in a Convolutional Neural Network, and which kinds of images it is learning to detect.</p>
<p>Convolutional Neural Networks rose to prominence since at least 2012, when <a href="http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/supervision.pdf">AlexNet</a> won the <a href="http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index#workshop">ImageNet computer vision contest</a> with an accuracy of 85%. The second place was at a mere 74%, and <a href="http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2013/results.php#cls">a year later</a> most competitors were switching to this “new” kind of algorithm.</p>
<p>They are widely used for many different tasks, mostly relating to <strong>image processing</strong>. These include Image Classification, Detection problems, and many others. </p>
<p>I will not go in depth into how a Convolutional Neural Network works, but if you’re getting started in this subject I recommend you read my <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/convolutional-neural-networks-an-introduction-tensorflow-eager/">Practical Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks</a> with working TensorFlow code.</p>
<p>If you already have a grasp of how a Convolutional Neural Network works, then this article is all you need to know to understand <strong>what Feature Visualization does</strong> and how it works.</p>
<h2>How does Feature Visualization work?</h2>
<p>Normally, you would train a CNN feeding it images and labels, and using Gradient Descent or a similar optimization method to <strong>fit the Neural Network’s weights</strong> so that it predicts the right label.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, one would expect the image to remain untouched, and the same applies to the label.</p>
<p>However, what do you think would happen if we took any image, picked one convolutional filter in our (already trained) network, and applied Gradient Descent <strong>on the input image</strong> to <strong>maximize that filter’s output</strong>, while <strong>leaving the Network’s weights constant</strong>?</p>
<p>Suddenly, we have <strong>shifted perspectives</strong>. We’re no longer training a model to predict an image’s label. Rather, we’re now kind of fitting the image to the model, to make it generate whatever output we want.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s like we’re asking the model “See this filter? What kind of images turn it on?”.</p>
<p>If our Network has been properly trained, then we expect most filters to carry interesting, valuable information that help the model make accurate predictions for its classification task. We expect a filter’s activation to carry <strong>semantic meaning</strong>.</p>
<p>It stands to reason then, that an image that “activates” a filter, making it have a large output, should have features that resemble those of one of the objects present in the Dataset (and among the model’s labels).</p>
<p>However, given that convolutions are a <strong>local transformation</strong>, it is common to see the patterns that trigger that convolutional filter repeatedly “sprout” in many different areas of our image. </p>
<p>This process generates the kind of picture <a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/#gallery">Google’s Deep Dream</a> model made popular.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will use <strong>TensorFlow’s Keras</strong> code to <strong>generate images</strong> that maximize a given filter’s output.</p>
<p>Since a filter’s output is technically a matrix, the actual function we will be maximizing is the average of that matrix’s components, <strong>averaged over the whole image</strong>. This way our algorithm will be incentivized to generate whatever pattern activates the filter, throughout the whole image.</p>
<h2>Implementing Filter Visualization</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, for this to work we would need to first <strong>train a Neural Network classifier</strong>. Luckily, we don’t need to go through that whole messy and costly process: <strong>Keras</strong> already comes with a whole suite of pre-trained Neural Networks we can just download and use.</p>
<h3>Using a Pre-trained Neural Network</h3>
<p>For this article, we will use VGG16, a huge Convolutional Neural Network trained on the same ImageNet competition Dataset. Remember how I mentioned AlexNet won with an 85% accuracy and disrupted the Image Classification field? VGG16 scored 92% on that same task.</p>
<blockquote><p>VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”.&nbsp;The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet,&nbsp;which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. It was one of the famous model submitted to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/results">ILSVRC-2014</a>. It makes the improvement over AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layer, respectively) with multiple 3×3 kernel-sized filters one after another. VGG16 <strong>was trained for weeks and was using NVIDIA Titan Black GPU’s</strong>.</p><cite><a href="https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/">https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/</a> — VGG16 – Convolutional Network for Classification and Detection (emphasis mine)</cite></blockquote>
<p>For these experiments I will be using<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"> Google colab’s </a>GPU machine, and tweaking Keras Library’s example of <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/conv_filter_visualization.py">Filter Visualization</a> code.</p>
<p>For a breakdown of how the original script works, you can see <a href="https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html">Keras Blog</a>. I only made slight changes to it to easily configure file names, and other minor details, so I don’t think it’s worth it to link to my own notebook.</p>
<p>What the important function does is:</p>
<ul><li>Define a loss function that’s equal to the chosen <strong>filter’s average output, over the whole image</strong>. In our code, we do this here: <code>loss = K.mean(layer_output[:, filter_index, :, :])</code>.</li><li>Initialize a small <strong>starting picture</strong>, typically with <strong>random uniform noise</strong> centered around RGB(128,128,128) (I actually played around with this a bit, and will expand on it later).</li><li>Compute the <strong>gradient of the input picture</strong> with regards to this loss, and perform gradient descent.<br>Note that we are <strong>feeding the image to the neural network</strong>, but ignoring any layer that comes after the one we are concerned with.</li><li>Repeat N times, then resize the picture to make it slightly bigger (default value was 20%). We start with a small picture and make it increasingly bigger as we generate the filter’s maximizing image, because otherwise the algorithm tends to create a small pattern that repeats many times, instead of making a lower-frequency pattern with bigger (and, subjectively, more aesthetically pleasing) shapes.</li><li>Repeat the last two steps until reaching the desired resolution.</li></ul>
<p>That’s pretty much it. The code I linked to has a few more things happening (image normalization, and stitching together many filters’ generated images into a cute collage) but that is the most important bit.</p>

<p>Here’s the code for that function, not that scary now that you know what’s going on right?</p>
<p>Now for the fun part, let’s try this out and see which kinds of filters come out.</p>
<h2>My Results Trying out Feature Visualization</h2>
<p>I read <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/">many</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-visualize-convolutional-features-in-40-lines-of-code-70b7d87b0030">different</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901.pdf">examples</a> of Feature Visualization articles before giving it a shot. Here are some of the things I learned.</p>
<ul><li>The first Convolutional Layers (the ones closer to the inputs) generate simpler visuals. They’re usually just rough textures like parallel wavy lines, or multicolored circles.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The Convolutional layers closer to the outputs generate more intricate textures and patterns. Some even resemble objects that exist, or sorta look like they may exist (in a very uncanny-valley kind of way).</li></ul>
<p>This is also where I had the most fun, to be honest. I tried out many different “starting images”, from random noise to uniform grey, to a progressive degrade. </p>
<p>The results for any given filter all came out pretty similar. This makes me think given the number of iterations I used, the starting image itself became pretty irrelevant. At the very least, it did not have a predictable impact on the results.</p>

<p>As we go deeper, and <strong>closer to the fully connected layers</strong>, we reach the <strong>last Convolutional Layer</strong>. The images it generates are the <strong>most intricate</strong> by far, and the patterns they make many times resemble real life items.</p>

<p>Now, looking into these images in search of patterns, it is easy to feel like one is falling into apophenia. However, I think we can all agree some of those images have features that <strong>really look like</strong>… you can zoom in and complete that sentence on your own. Feature Visualization is the new gazing at clouds.</p>
<p>My own guess is it’s just a new kind of abstract art.</p>
<p>Let me show you some of the filters I found most visually interesting:</p>

# palette_records - Zelda Palette Address Records
#
# Zelda (NES) has 4 color palettes, nicknamed "grey", "red",
# "green", and "brown". Each palette has 3 main colors:
#
# 1. Mountains, trees, rocks.
# 2. Pathway.
# 3. Water.
#
# For more information see "Zelda Overworld Color Hacking"
# (Dr. Floppy, 2006).
#
# In this data, the entries are structured like
#
#   palette: [(a1,z1),(a2,z2),(a3,z3)]
#
# where:
#
# - `palette` is "grey", "red", "green", "brown".
# - `a1` is the memory address of the palette entry for
#   color 1 (mountains, trees, rocks).
# - `z1` is the default color-byte (q.v. `z` in
#   `col_records`) for palette color 1.
# - Similarly for `a2`-`z2` (pathway) and `a3`-`z3` (water).

<blockquote>
<p>"Why am I making a programming language?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question keeps rolling around in my head as I'm typing out the code that is
slowly shaping into <em>Rune</em>. Programming is like magic. You imagine it in your
mind, write it out, and there it is. Doing <em>stuff</em> which wasn't being done
before.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I'm scared that people will tell me that I'm wasting my time.
This has already been done, or "Why not just use X?". A thing so glaringly
obvious that all of my efforts are wasted.</p>
<p>But you actually don't need a reason. It can simply be for The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting">Joy of
Creating</a>, and then it's just you. Spending your own time. No harm done.</p>
<p>But I want to talk about why I'm making Rune beyond just for fun. So I'm
dedicating this foreword to it. I feel obligated to describe why this might
matter to others.</p>
<p>So here's why I'm making a new programming language.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of effort working on <a href="https://github.com/udoprog/OxidizeBot">OxidizeBot</a>, a Twitch bot that streamers
can use to add commands and other interactive things in their chat. I built it
for myself while streaming. When adding features I always spend way too much time
tinkering with it. Making it as generic as possible so it can solve more than
just one problem. When it's a personal project, I don't care about being
efficient. I care much more about doing things the right way.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ok, I <em>sometimes</em> do that professionally as well. But a working environment is
much more constrained. Personal projects should be fun!</p>
<p>Anyway, that means the bot isn't overly specialized to only suit my needs and
can be used by others. It's starting to see a little bit of that use now which
is a lot of fun. I made something which helps people do something cool.</p>
<p>All the commands in the bot are written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/udoprog/OxidizeBot/tree/master/bot/src/module">compiled straight into
the bot</a>. This is nice because Rust is an incredible language. But Rust is also
complex. Not needlessly mind you. I believe it's complex because it
tackles <em>really hard problems</em>. And that usually comes with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterbed_theory">base level of
complexity</a> it's very hard to get rid of.</p>
<p>But it's still tricky enough that streamers who have limited programming
experience struggle getting up and running. I wanted them to be able to write
their own commands. Ones they could just drop into a folder and <em>presto</em> -
you're up and running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To this day I've tutored two of these streamers who were interested in
learning Rust to write their own commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Embedding a Rust compiler isn't feasible. So I started looking into dynamic
programming languages. Ones that could be embedded into an existing application
with little to no effort. That seamlessly integrates with its environment.
A number of candidates came up, but the one that stood out the most to me was
<a href="https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai">Rhai</a>.</p>
<p>So why is Rhai awesome? It has Rust-like syntax. The runtime is fully written in
mostly safe Rust, and can be easily embedded. Hooking up Rust functions is a
piece of cake.</p>
<p>But Rhai has a set of design decisions which didn't <em>exactly</em> scratch my itch.
The more I used it, the more I got inspired and started thinking about things
that could be changed or added. <a href="https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai/commits?author=udoprog">I contributed a bit to the project</a>. And it
started to dawn on me that Rhai's approach wasn't exactly what I wanted. There's
nothing wrong with this. The authors of Rhai have specific goals and ideas of
what they want to accomplish. While it would be feasible to push Rhai in a
different direction, the project would emerge looking much different on the
other side. Which wouldn't be fair towards the people leveraging Rhai's
strengths today. So I wanted a clean slate to find my own compromises. To
discover freely what works and doesn't work well.</p>
<p>When I started working on Rune I had the following <em>rough</em> goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance should be comparable to Lua and Python (And eventually LuaJIT when
we have cranelift).</li>
<li>Scripts should compile quickly.</li>
<li>Rune should feel like "Rust without types".</li>
<li>Excellent support for asynchronous programming (i.e. native <code>select</code> statements).</li>
<li>Be as good as Rhai when it comes to integrating with native Rust.</li>
<li>Work well through C bindings.</li>
<li>A minimalistic stack-based runtime that is strictly single threaded*.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*: If this feels like a step backwards to you, don't worry too much. We can
still have concurrency and threading using async code as you'll see later in
this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rune is now in a state where I want people to poke at it. Not <em>too</em> hard mind
you. It's still early days. The compiler is very much in flux and a
miscompilation will definitely cause the wrong closure to be called. You know,
the one that <em>doesn't</em> doesn't perform your security checks 😅.</p>
<p>But the more poking and prodding people do, the more issues will be found. Every
solved issue brings Rune one step close to being production ready. Every set of
eyeballs that takes a look can bring fresh perspective and ideas, making the
project better for me and everyone else.</p>
<p>I really want to thank Jonathan Turner and all the contributors to the Rhai
project. They have been an an immense inspiration to me. If you need an embedded
scripting engine that is more mature right now than <em>Rune</em>, please do take
<em>Rhai</em> for a spin.</p>
<p>You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/rune-rs/rune/">on its GitHub page</a>. I hope you'll enjoy using
it as much as I've enjoyed making it!</p>

September 5, 2020 | https://eugeneyan.com/writing/end-to-end-data-science/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eugeneyan.com/writing/end-to-end-data-science/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i48b5q/for_those_that_work_for_a_team_that_has_both_data/" target="_blank">Reddit thread</a> on the different roles in data science and machine learning: data scientist, decision scientist, product data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, machine learning tooling engineer, AI architect, etc.</p>

<p>I found this <em>worrying</em>. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.</p>

<p>IMHO, <strong>I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end</strong>. Here, I’ll discuss the <a href="#from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">benefits</a> and <a href="#but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">counter-arguments</a>, <a href="#the-best-way-to-pick-it-up-is-via-learning-by-doing">how to</a> become end-to-end, and the experiences of <a href="#end-to-end-in-stitch-fix-and-netflix">Stitch Fix and Netflix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">From start (identify the problem) to finish (solve it)</h2>

<p>You may have come across similar <em>labels</em> and definitions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c" target="_blank">Generalist</a>: Focused on roles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager" target="_blank">PM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst" target="_blank">BA</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition/" target="_blank">DE</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_scientists" target="_blank">DS</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-a-machine-learning-engineer-do" target="_blank">MLE</a>); some negative connotation</li>
  <li><a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/" target="_blank">Full-stack</a>: Focused on tech (Spark, Torch, Docker); popularized by full-stack devs</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429185/stop-searching-for-that-data-science-unicorn.html" target="_blank">Unicorn</a>: Focused on mythology; believed not to exist</li>
</ul>

<p>I find these definitions to be more prescriptive than I prefer. Instead, I have a simple (and pragmatic) definition: An end-to-end data scientist can <strong>identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value</strong>. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem? Why is it important?</li>
  <li>Can we solve it? How should we solve it?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Data Science Processes</summary>
<div>
<p>Another way of defining end-to-end data science is via processes. These processes are usually complex and I’ve left them out of the main discussion. Nonetheless, here are a few in case you’re curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (1997).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process" target="_blank">KDD</a>: Knowledge Discovery in Databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview" target="_blank">TDSP</a>: Team Data Science Process, proposed by Microsoft in 2018.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dslp/dslp" target="_blank">DSLP</a>: Data Science Lifecycle Process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if these processes seem heavy and overwhelming. You don’t have to adopt them wholesale—start bit by bit, keep what works and adapt the rest.</p>
</div>

</details>

<h2 id="more-context-faster-iteration-greater-satisfaction">More context, faster iteration, greater satisfaction</h2>

<p>For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact. (Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Santa-Clara/Senior-Deep-Learning-Data-Scientist--RAPIDS---AI_JR1929838" target="_blank">roles</a> that focus on machine learning.)</p>

<p><strong>Working end-to-end provides increased context.</strong> While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem. Let’s say conversion has decreased and a PM raises a request to improve our search algorithm. However, what’s causing the decrease in the first place? There could be various causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product: Is fraudulent/poor quality product reducing customer trust?</li>
  <li>Data pipelines: Has data quality been compromised or are there delays/outages?</li>
  <li>Model refresh: Is the model not refreshing regularly/correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>More often than not, the problem—and solution—lies <em>outside</em> of machine learning. A solution to <em>improve the algorithm</em> would miss the root cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it</li>
  <li>Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app</li>
</ul>

<p>By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and coordination overhead is reduced.</strong> With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. – Frederick P. Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DE and DS need to <em>communicate</em> on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.</p>

<p>It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.</p>

<p>While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.</p>

<p>(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)</p>

<details><summary>The Cost of Communication and Coordination</summary>
<div>
<p>Richard Hackman, a Harvard psychologist, showed that the number of relationships in a team is <code><span>N</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span></code>, where <code><span>N</span></code> is the number of people. This leads to exponential growth in links, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A start-up team of 7 has 21 links to maintain</li>
  <li>A group of 21 (i.e., three start-up teams) has 210 links</li>
  <li>A group of 63 has almost 2,000 links.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our simple example, we only had three roles (i.e., six links). But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate. (Amazon’s <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/" target="_blank">two-pizza teams</a> are a possible solution to this.)</p>
</div>
</details>

<p><strong>Iteration and learning rate is increased.</strong> With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.</p>

<p>This is especially important for developing data and algorithmic products. Unlike software engineering (a far more mature craft), we can’t do all the learning and design before we start building—our blueprints, architectures, and design patterns are not as developed. Thus, rapid iteration is essential for the design-build-learn cycle.</p>

<p><strong>There’s greater ownership and accountability.</strong> Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.</p>

<p>A common anti-pattern observed is “<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThrownOverTheWall" target="_blank">throw over the wall</a>”. For example, the DE creates features and throws a database table to the DS, the DS trains a model and throws <code>R</code> code over to the MLE, and the MLE translates it to <code>Java</code> to production.</p>

<p>If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.</p>

<p>Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.</p>

<details><summary>Diffusion of Responsibilty &amp; Social Loafing</summary>
<div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">Diffusion of responsibility</a>: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation. </p>

<p>One form of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Bystander_effect" target="_blank">Bystander effect</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank">Kitty Genovese</a> was stabbed outside the apartment building across the street from where she lived. While there were 38 witnesses who saw or heard the attack, none called the police or helped her.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing" target="_blank">Social loafing</a>: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p><strong>For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/" target="_blank">closely tied</a> to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">But, we need specialist experts too</h2>

<p>Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:</p>

<p><strong>Wanting to specialize</strong> in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: <a href="https://mc.ai/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3/" target="_blank">GPT-3 primer</a>). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.</p>

Because it mirrors our identity, technology provokes us to revisit outdated creeds while at the same time giving us the reins to personalize our human experience.</p><p>In the evolution of species, there's always a fine line between symbiosis and competition for survival. Is AI going to take over the world? Will AI take my job? In fall 2020, a Google search returns over 1B results for each of these questions. Internet users are particularly interested in how the AI-human symbiosis will shape over time. More than anything, people are apprehensive of a future where the power dynamic changes to humanity's disadvantage.&nbsp;</p><p>The advent of AI might seem overwhelming to us, but history books consist of many pages on similar topics. One such example is the industrial revolution of the 18-19th century, which helped automate the labor workers did with their hands. The industrial revolution was a painful tipping point; it led to decades of&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/what-the-industrial-revolution-really-tells-us-about-the-future-of-automation-and-work-82051" target="_blank">social and economic upheaval</a>, but it also freed up time for thinking, inquiring, and innovating.</p><p>You can argue that the industrial revolution expedited the timeline for advanced technology like AI. Across the world, automation and artificial intelligence are beginning to permeate entire industries. Knowledge workers previously untouched by the industrial revolution (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3067279/you-didnt-see-this-coming-10-jobs-that-will-be-replaced-by-robots" target="_blank">accountants, lawyers, bankers</a>) are likely to undergo career transitions as their jobs change substantially under the guise of automation. A research report published by the&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-automation-affects-high-skill-workers-more-often-but-low-skill-workers-more-deeply" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a>&nbsp;concluded that automation affects high-skill workers more often, but low-skill workers more deeply. Just like personal computers impacted people across the board, AI heralds a cognitive revolution that will free up time for people to feel, create, and experience - assuming we can meet our basic physical and psychological needs.&nbsp;</p><p>AI's true potential does not come from automation alone, but from how it can become a symbiotic part of life, enhancing - not replacing - the output of people. Beyond being an ideal work colleague, AI could also play the role of a life partner, empowering us to master our human qualities and elevate our life experience to new heights. AI can help us understand the human condition, improve our life perception, and coordinate a healthy body and mind.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="11.59678858162355" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599240734692_10165"><div>

If humans are capable of explaining themselves, so should machines. But are humans truly capable of explaining themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>I've recently watched an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfdlIMlPmuA" target="_blank">authentic retrospective</a>&nbsp;between a couple who failed to make their romantic relationship work. While grown-ups, these people could not explain why they acted a certain way in the relationship. There are many reasons why individuals cannot articulate their feelings. Sometimes you do not have the vocabulary to translate what you feel into a logical framework. Other times, you're not even inhabiting the present. At times, you're experiencing an emotional hijack.</p><p>The bypassing of logic is what psychologists refer to as an emotional hijack. The amygdala, the part of the brain that serves as our emotional processor, can hijack the normal reasoning process. This hijacking mechanism helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors survive through harsh conditions. Back in the early days, when we lived in caves and hunted our food, our primary objective was to guard against reptiles, predators, or other cave dwellers. We needed a brain that was hyper-vigilant and quick on the trigger. Thanks to recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.andreeabodnari.com/blog/how-neuroscience-inspires-ai" target="_blank">neuroscience</a>&nbsp;advances, we know that processing information logically requires complex neural architectures to work in tandem. The complete orchestration of neurons can take a longer time than our ancestors had to evacuate the danger zone. While the amygdala design helped with physical survival, its interjection in modern-day settings is not always ideal.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599240085229_17930"><div>

We are still subject to the impulsive control of the amygdala. It takes an active effort to switch from the fight-of-flight reaction of the amygdala to the poised methods of the frontal cortex. The amygdala will make your veins swallow, raise your heart rate, cloud your judgment. On the other hand, your frontal cortex will identify that you feel hurt by a comment made by your boss and analyze solutions to restore emotional balance in that work meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>How can you transition from an impulsive brain to cognitive behavior? Ideally, you'd teach your brain new tricks that help it reason through threatening situations. That journey can be an overwhelming one to travel alone or without support. Some companies are already working on tech that leverages data and AI to help us handle emotions either passively through meditation, actively through talk therapy, or more invasively through feedback relayed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-implants-for-mood-disorders-tested-in-people/#:~:text=Brain%20implants%20that%20deliver%20electrical,people%20for%20the%20first%20time.&amp;text=It%20is%20used%20to%20treat,when%20tested%20against%20mood%20disorders." target="_blank">brain implants</a>. These personalized, data-driven tools can coach the brain to make sense of what it feels and gradually equip us to own the life experience fully.<br></p><h4><strong>#healthyHuman</strong></h4><p>Healthcare is an analytical discipline, unlike its sibling -wellness- which can wander away from science. Whenever you apply a scientific lens to a problem, you model that problem space based on empirical observations and experiments. The healthcare model of the world is an odd one because it assumes the presence of disease. When we talk about healthcare, it all trickles down to the illness: which one you have, how you will treat it, which side effects you have, how you will handle those. Financial incentives in the American healthcare industry reward the management of the disease, while disease prevention is the rare exception on your list of insurance benefits. Maybe healthcare should be rebranded to #sick-care since we care for the sick and ignore the seemingly healthy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>AI heralds tectonic shifts for the healthcare industry, especially when it comes to our ability to prevent disease onset and progression. Improved imaging technologies can pick up risk factors from a more easily accessible surface like the eye retina. Portable body scanners enable remote workers to screen patients with a device the size of a mobile phone. And AI reading machines can go through medical records and discern the likelihood of disease from medical cues written down by doctors. Genetic testing brings us closer to predicting the risk of illness decades before disease onset. With a clear understanding of each individual's health outlook, we can affirm healthy behavior and offer personalized support in vulnerable areas. Imagine living in your optimal state; imagine personalized experiences curated for your wellbeing. Data-driven life experiences can help us enjoy life at our full potential.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="26.31578947368421" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599243021749_7620"><div>

<p>Last month <a href="https://danielvassallo.com/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts/">I left my job at Amazon to work for myself</a>. I’m no longer an employee, but if I were ever to become one again, here’s what I’ll keep in mind.</p>



<h3 id="mce_4">Many things won’t be within my control.</h3>



<p>Getting promoted, getting a raise, getting recognized, getting on an important project — these are all things that an employee can never fully control, regardless of the effort made. Some people I worked with made their well-being dependent on these things. I tried not to. It’s normal to be disappointed by undesirable outcomes, but I try to avoid having externally controlled outcomes play a role in my satisfaction and self-esteem.</p>



<h3>My satisfaction comes from challenges, not from outcomes.</h3>



<p>Most companies function by setting goals and holding people accountable for the outcomes. The problem is, I don’t consider myself to be goal-driven. I don’t set goals for myself; I cannot remember ever setting one. I have targets, but I don’t try to hold myself accountable for the outcomes. Employers, however, care a lot about outcomes, and as an employee I always wanted to do my best to deliver what my employer wanted. So my approach was to mentally transform the company’s goals into small daily challenges. Tackling a challenge, brainstorming solutions, trying my best, finding an easy way out — doing those things can give me satisfaction regardless of the outcome. It’s the journey that matters to me, not the outcome, and the journey is just a stream of daily challenges coupled with my best attempts to tackle them.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Trying to get promoted is the fastest way not to get promoted.</h3>



<p>Promotions are usually the biggest carrot that employers dangle in front of employees to “motivate them”. A promotion doesn’t cost the employer anything, which is definitely not the case for other motivational incentives, such as a bonus, or a day off. Luckily for the employer, employees tend to want promotions a lot — probably more than they want bonuses and days off. However, once again, promotions are outcomes controlled by many variables and by random subjective people. They are never really in the employee’s control. My trick was not to desire one. I never asked my manager what I needed to do to get a promotion, I never asked to discuss my career plan, I never looked for a career mentor, I never tried to impress those that would be evaluating me — nothing of that sort. I just focused on the things in my control: doing the best work I could, as if it were my own company, and treating others how I wanted to be treated.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">The company’s opinions are not necessarily my opinions.</h3>



<p>Being a good employee is like being a lawyer acting for a client. The lawyer’s job is to make the best case for the client, regardless of what the lawyer might think. My job as an employee was to do the best work I could, the way the company wanted, based on the values and opinions of the company. Just like the lawyer, I would occasionally voice my opinion privately when we didn’t see things entirely eye to eye. But it was always on me to disagree and commit. And also just like the lawyer, there were always moral and legal lines I wouldn’t cross. But as long as I held the job, I carried out my duty. For example, whenever I talked to customers, I always gave them the company’s opinion of the products, not my own. That’s how it’s supposed to be. If I were to employ people, that’s what I would want them to do.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Meaningless work is the cost of doing business.</h3>



<p>Most policies, processes, and procedures that I’ve been subject to by my employers had things in them that I thought were completely meaningless, and that I wouldn’t do if I were in charge. This work was the hardest type for me to do, especially when it carried on for days, weeks, and months. The bigger the company and the more distant the policy-makers are from the makers, the more of this you can expect. The best mechanism I found to convince my procrastinating self to persevere with this work was to think of it as a cost of doing business, rather than a purposeless task. That simple mental switch suddenly gives it meaning in the complex universe of a company.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Rewards kill my enthusiasm.</h3>



<p>I never liked having incentives dangled in front of me, and I don’t trust people that tell me: If you do this, you’ll get that. I’ve hated this for as long as I can remember, because it always feels like somebody is trying to control me or trying to change my behavior. I respond very negatively to the perception of being controlled, so as much as I can, I try to avoid such environments. When I can’t do that, I try to ignore the incentives, and just focus on the things that I can control, such as doing the best work that I can. This has helped me to find peace of mind in environments filled with carrots and sticks.</p>



<h3 id="mce_20">Only intrinsic motivation lasts.</h3>



<p>There are things that I feel intrinsically driven to do, even when there’s no incentive or punishment compelling me to do them. The best kind of work for me is work driven by this intrinsic energy. I might be doing other things, but I would always be looking for opportunities that allow me to spend more time on work driven by my intrinsic motivation. My last job was very good by every measure, but once I discovered an alternative path that would allow me to use my intrinsic motivation more, it became practically impossible for me to stay. If I were to become an employee again, I’d be very careful not to let the extrinsic rewards distort how I measure job opportunities. Once I attain a certain level of financial security, the satisfaction from rewards wears off quickly, and only intrinsic motivation lasts.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When I began this project, many months ago, there were no good resources on Tokio. I procrastinated on writing this blog series, but my intention was for it to be a guide on using Tokio and implementing a real project. A reference of sorts. When I began populating this blog in March, there still weren’t any resources. That is no longer the case. I recently discovered that Tokio added a <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial" target="_blank">much better tutorial</a> in June.</p><p>This project/tutorial series was my way of learning Rust and Tokio, and I’ve gained a lot out of it. However, the mini-redis tutorial that I linked above seems to cover everything that I would. By the end of this section, we’ll have a client-server architecture that is easily extensible to be a compliant MQTT broker, but I won’t continue the tutorial to create a full-blown MQTT server. If people are interested, I can continue the series, but I don’t see the need for it anymore. So let’s continue from where we left off:</p><h2 id="splitting-up-our-code">Splitting up our code<a href="#splitting-up-our-code" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>Currently, we have two files of Rust code and just a few large functions. Let’s split our code making use of an architecture that will make it easy to manage state, which will be stored in our server/broker.</p><figure><img src="https://hassamuddin.com/files/blog/rust-mqtt/architecture.png"><figcaption><h4>Seperation of Client and State</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s create a <code>broker.rs</code> with a <code>Broker</code> struct and give it a method to start the server.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Broker</span>;

<span>impl</span> Broker {
  <span>pub</span> async <span>fn</span> <span>start_server</span>(addr: <span>IpAddr</span>, port: <span>u16</span>) -&gt; Result<span>&lt;</span>(), Box<span>&lt;</span>dyn Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> {
    <span>// ...
</span><span></span>  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Inside of this method, we’ll want to do what we’re doing right now, spawn a thread for every new connection, but we’ll do it in another <code>Client</code> struct. Eventually, we’ll establish communication between our Broker and Client.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/broker.rs; start_server

</code></pre></div><p>A little long, but it’s all boilerplate that we’ve done already. We can remove all of our code in <code>main.rs</code> and instead call our Broker’s <code>start_server</code> function, and you’ll see that nothing has changed. Let’s add some spice now.</p><h2 id="channels">Channels<a href="#channels" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>Ideally, we want to store information between every single client. We need someplace to store the subscriptions of every client, and some way for clients to send messages to other clients. Now, the straightforward way would be to have some global mutable struct, probably called <code>BrokerState</code>, that stores the information for every client and sockets for communication. You’ll quickly realize that doing that sucks. It is awful. Every step of the way, you will be hit with safety errors and deadlocks and it’s just going to be painful.</p><p>A smarter way is to implement the architecture that we defined earlier. We’ll pass <em>messages</em> between the client and broker, and the broker and client can decide what to do with each message. This way, there is no interaction between clients and the only interaction between client and broker is through the channels. The nice thing about this architecture is that it mimics the MQTT architecture, so we can just reuse the MQTT Packets as our messages.</p><p>We want the broker to have one channel that it gets all of its messages from, and a list of channels to talk to the clients with. Tokio, with the <code>sync</code> feature, allows us to use <code>tokio::sync::mpsc::channel</code> to create a “multi-producer, single-consumer” channel. This will let all the clients speak to the Broker, with Broker only needing to listen to one “thing”. It’s a good idea to create our wrapper over the <code>Packet</code> struct to use as a message:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/broker.rs
</span><span></span><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>BrokerMessage</span> {
  NewConnection {
    client: <span>Client</span>,
    tx_client: <span>Sender</span><span>&lt;</span>Packet<span>&gt;</span>,
  },
  Message {
    packet: <span>Packet</span>,
    id: String,
  },
}
</code></pre></div><p>When the client finds a Connect packet, it’ll create a channel for itself and send that to the broker, and then whenever the client receives a message from the socket, it’ll forward that to the broker. What do we do if the broker wants to send something to the socket? How can the client thread listen to both the socket and the broker at the same time? <code>tokio::select!</code></p><h2 id="implementing-the-client">Implementing the client<a href="#implementing-the-client" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>So, our new client loop is going to look something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/client.rs;
</span><span></span><span>pub</span> async <span>fn</span> <span>handle_client</span>(
  stream: <span>TcpStream</span>,
  addr: <span>SocketAddr</span>,
) {
  <span>// do connection handshake as before
</span><span></span>  <span>// ...
</span><span></span>  <span>let</span> (tx_client, <span>mut</span> rx_client): (Sender<span>&lt;</span>Packet<span>&gt;</span>, Receiver<span>&lt;</span>Packet<span>&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> mpsc::channel(<span>100</span>); <span>// 100 is just a magic number
</span><span></span>  <span>// TODO: Send this to the broker
</span><span></span>
  <span>loop</span> {
    tokio::select<span>!</span> {
      <span>// we got a message from the socket
</span><span></span>      Some(Ok(packet)) <span>=</span> framed.next() <span>=&gt;</span> {
        <span>// handle_message will forward the packet to the broker
</span><span></span>        <span>match</span> packet {
          Packet::Disconnect <span>=&gt;</span> {
            Client::handle_messages(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> framed, client_key.clone(), packet).await;
            <span>break</span>;
          },
          _ <span>=&gt;</span> {
            Client::handle_messages(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> framed, client_key.clone(), packet).await;
          }
        }
      },
      <span>// we got a message from the Broker
</span><span></span>      Some(packet) <span>=</span> rx_client.next() <span>=&gt;</span> {
          <span>// send it to the socket
</span><span></span>          framed.send(packet).await.unwrap();
      },
      <span>else</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>break</span>
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>tokio::select!</code> macro is really elegant, allowing you to match over various futures and run code on them at the same time. Notice that we are not doing <code>framed.next().await</code>, since the macro expects Futures for it to await. If both Futures run and don’t match our pattern, the else block is executed.</p><p>While we’re at it, let’s extend our Client struct to hold some more useful information that we could use later if we desired:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Client</span> {
  <span>pub</span> id: String,
  addr: <span>SocketAddr</span>,

}
<span>/// ...
</span><span></span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(id: String, addr: <span>SocketAddr</span>) -&gt; <span>Client</span> {
  Client {
    id,
    addr,
    topics: <span>HashSet</span>::new(),
  }
}

<span>// let's create a client as well
</span><span>// in handle_client, after connection handshake
</span><span></span><span>let</span> client_key <span>=</span> connect.client_id.to_string();
<span>let</span> client <span>=</span> Client::new(client_key.clone(), addr);
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we need some way for the broker to communicate with the client. Let’s create a channel that we clone and send to every single client that is created.</p><h2 id="implementing-the-client-1">Implementing the Client<a href="#implementing-the-client-1" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/broker.rs; start_server

  <span>// ... rest of the handle_client loop

</code></pre></div><p>Last but not least, let’s add the handling of packets to the broker.

    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/TI99-IMG_7143.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A"></p>
<p>When I was around 13-14 years old, home computers were just appearing
on the market.  The first machines that I remember to have been sold
in the large department stores in Berlin were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">Atari 400 and
800</a> as well as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a>.
At the time, these machines were incredibly expensive, but me and my
friends often hung out in the stores to play around with these
machines and dream of owning them.</p>
<p>I found the TI-99/4A to be very good looking with its late 1970ies US
design and its nice keyboard.  In magazines I read that the machine
was slow and crippled, though, and the british home computers were
much cheaper, so I never became friends with the TI back then.</p>
<p>Recently, I found a machine cheaply on sale on an auction site and
bought it, despite the fact that neither the power supply nor the TV
modulator was included with the system.  The power brick was easy to
buy separately and I thought that I would not want the TV modulator
anyway.  I figured that the (european) TI outputs a component (YPbPr)
video signal and decided to try some conversion circuits that I found
on the Internet until I got something that one of my monitors could
display.</p>
<p>The first two attempts that I made failed, though.  One of the
schematics I had was a generic YPbPr conversion circuit based on a
bunch of opamps.  It did not produce a picture at all, but not knowing
enough about video signal encoding I did not manage to debug the
problem.  The same happened with another schematic that supposedly was
specifically designed for the TI-99/4A, but did not work for me
either.  Finally, I run across a new adapter circuit called
<a href="https://tms-rgb.com/">TMS-RGB</a> designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/npiegdon">Nicholas
Piegdon</a> just this year.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-pcb.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB PCB"></p>
<p>The TMS-RGB is a generic RGB converter for systems using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918">TMS9929A</a>
chip, i.e. the TI-99/4A, some MSX systems and the ColecoVision.  It is
a tightly packed PCB with surface mounted components meant to be
soldered onto the solder side of the PCB of the machine to be
converted.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-on-ti.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB mounted on TI-99/4A board"></p>
<p>To me, getting the PCB fabricated in China, sourcing the components
and soldering them onto the board with a microscope was part of the
fun.  It was not all that easy, though, and the TMS-RGB website has
some shops listed that sell the board ready for installation.
Installing it in the machine is very easy thanks to the excellent
videos published on the site.</p>
<p>The TMS-RGB converts the YPrPb signal to RGB + Sync, but it does not
change the overall timing.  This means that one either needs a monitor
that can deal with TV format RGB signals (i.e. one that has a RGB
SCART Input or a CBM 1084), or an upscaler that converts the signal to
match the expectations of a more modern computer monitor.  I bought a
cheap GBS-8200 upscaler board which produces a VGA output and it
worked fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/ti-and-upscaler.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A board and GNS-8200 upscaler"></p>
<p>In fact, the picture quality that I get with this on my TFT monitor is
just awesome.  The pixels are crisp and the is no blur, jail bars or
ghosting.  I can recommend the TMS-RGB board to anyone who wants to
equip their TMS9929A based hardware with a better video output.  The
overall cost for the PCB's, components and the upscaler board was
around 70 Euros.</p>

Hair painstakingly straightened by heat will bounce back into curls the minute it touches water. Why? Because hair has shape memory. Its material properties allow it to change shape in response to certain stimuli and return to its original shape in response to others.</p><figure></figure><p><i>Video:&nbsp;“Wool-like material can remember and change shape” by&nbsp;Harvard John A.

Imagine a t-shirt with cooling vents that opened when exposed to moisture and closed when dry, or one-size-fits-all clothing that stretches or shrinks to a person’s measurements. </p><p>Now, researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a biocompatible material that can be 3D-printed into any shape and pre-programmed with reversible shape memory. The material is made using keratin, a fibrous protein found in hair, nails and shells. The researchers extracted the keratin from leftover Agora wool used in textile manufacturing.</p><p>The research could help the broader effort of reducing waste in the fashion industry, one of the biggest polluters on the planet.

With recycled keratin protein, we can do just as much, or more, than what has been done by shearing animals to date and, in doing so, reduce the environmental impact of the textile and fashion industry.”</p><p>The research is published in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41563-020-0789-2&amp;t=NTdhNTYwMzliMDYzYjBjMmNiODEwZmZlNzhkOTA1YmFkYzcwZGY0MyxVQlEwb1RGTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F628453474954264576%2Fnovel-wool-like-material&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599553521"><i>Nature Materials</i></a>. </p><p>The key to keratin’s shape-changing abilities is its hierarchical structure, said Luca Cera, a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and first author of the paper.</p><p>A single chain of keratin is arranged into a spring-like structure known as alpha-helix. Two of these chains twist together to form a structure known as a coiled coil. Many of these coiled coils are assembled into protofilaments and eventually large fibers. </p><p>“The organization of the alpha helix and the connective chemical bonds give the material both strength and shape memory,” said Cera. </p><p>When a fiber is stretched or exposed to a particular stimulus, the spring-like structures uncoil, and the bonds realign to form stable beta-sheets. The fiber remains in that position until it is triggered to coil back into its original shape.</p><p>To demonstrate this process, the researchers 3D-printed keratin sheets in a variety of shapes. They programmed the material’s permanent shape — the shape it will always return to when triggered — using a solution of hydrogen peroxide and monosodium phosphate. </p><p>Once the memory was set, the sheet could be re-programmed and molded into new shapes. </p><p>For example, one keratin sheet was folded into a complex origami star as its permanent shape. Once the memory was set, the researchers dunked the star in water, where it unfolded and became malleable. From there, they rolled the sheet into a tight tube. Once dry, the sheet was locked in as a fully stable and functional tube. To reverse the process, they put the tube back into water, where it unrolled and folded back into an origami star.</p><figure data-orig-width="800" data-orig-height="450"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f7fa843d07f545fee9c49f59686392f3/3fb0c40b12b14701-a5/s1280x1920/e551249fe992dd3a04fff3a6199cfad2a594392d.gifv" alt="image" data-orig-width="800" data-orig-height="450" width="800" height="450"></figure><p><i>Motion graphic:&nbsp;A keratin sheet folded into a complex origami star as its permanent shape.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>So the other day I both defined Tcl procedures all by myself and used them interactively, and I liked it, to the point where it felt like some kind of local optimum. This entry is an attempt to cope with the trauma of liking Tcl, by means of rationalizing it. I'll first tell the story of my fascinating adventures, and then I'll do the rationalizing (to skip the oh-so-personal first part, go straight for the bullet points).</p>
<p>Here's what I was doing. I have this board. The board has a chip on it. The chip has several processors in it. There's a processor in there that is a memory-mapped device, and I talk to it using CPU load/store commands. The CPU is itself a JTAG target, and I talk to it via a probe, issuing those load/store commands. To the probe I talk via USB using an ugly console that can't even handle the clipboard properly. The console speaks Tcl.</p>
<p>Net result: in order to talk to the memory-mapped processor, I have to speak Tcl. Or I can use a memory view window in a graphical debugger. Except some addresses will change the processor state when read (pop an item from a LIFO, that sort of thing). So no, memory view windows aren't a good idea – you have to aim for the specific address, not shoot at whole address ranges. Damn, just who thought of defining the hardware in such a stupid way? Why, it was me. Little did I know that I was thereby inflicting Tcl on myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's this bug I have to debug now, and as far as I know it could be in at least three different pieces of software or in two different pieces of hardware, and I don't like any of the 5 options very much, and I want to find out what it is already. So at the ugly probe console I type things like <code>word 0x1f8cc000</code> (reads the processor status), <code>word 0x1f8cc008 2</code> (halts the execution), <code>word 0x1f8cc020 0x875</code> (places a breakpoint). I get sick and tired of this in about 2 minutes, when the command history is large enough to make the probability of hitting Enter at the wrong auto-completed command annoying. It's annoying to run the wrong command because if I ruin the processor state, it will take me minutes to reproduce that state, because the program reads input via JTAG, which is as slow as it gets.</p>
<p>So I figure this isn't the last bug I'm gonna deal with this way, and it's therefore time for Extending my Environment, equipping myself with the Right Tools for the Job, Tailored to my needs, utilizing the Scripting capabilities of the system. I hate that, I really do. Is there something more distressing than the development of development tools for the mass market of a single developer? Can a programmer have a weakness more pathetic than the tendency to solve easy generic meta-problems when the real, specific problems are too hard? Is there software more disgusting in nature than plug-ins and extensions for a butt-ugly base system? But you know what, I really fail to remember 0x1f8cwhat the breakpoint address is. This story has one hexadecimal value too much for my brain. OK, then. Tcl.</p>
<p>I decided to have one entry point procedure, <code>pmem</code>, that would get a memory-mapped processor id, 'cause there are many of them, and then call one of several functions with the right base address, so that <code>pmem 0 pc</code> would do the same as <code>pmem_pc 0x1f8c0000</code>. Well, in Tcl that's as simple as it gets. Tcl likes to generate and evaluate command strings. More generally, Tcl likes strings. In fact, it likes them more than anything else. In normal programming languages, things are variables and expressions by default. In Tcl, they are strings. <code>abc</code> isn't a variable reference – it's a string. <code>$abc</code> is the variable reference. <code>a+b/c</code> isn't an expression – it's a string. <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code> is the expression. Could you believe that? <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code>. Isn't that ridiculous?</p>
<p>In fact, that was one of my main applications for Tcl: ridiculing it. I remember reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130385603">the huge Tcl/Tk book by Brent Welch</a> with my friend once. There was a power outage and it was past the time when the last UPS squeaked its last squeak. And the book was there 'cause the hardware guys use it for scripting their lovecraftian toolchain. We really did have fun. Tears went down my cheeks from laughter. Even people with the usual frightened/mean comments about those geeks who laugh their brains out over a Tcl book  didn't spoil it. So, ridiculing Tcl, my #1 use for it. The other use is the occasional scripting of the hardware hackers' lovecraftian toolchain. Overall, I don't use Tcl very much.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Tcl is that it's still a dynamic language, and reasonably laconic at that, modulo quoting and escaping. So I enter the usual addictive edit/test cycle using <code>tclsh &lt; script</code>. N minutes down the road (I really don't know what N was), I've finished my 2 screenfuls of Tcl and the fun starts. I actually start debugging the goddamn thing.<br>
<code><br>
$ pmem 0 stat<br>
IDLE<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 0 0xbff<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 1 0xa57<br>
$ pmem 0 cmd run<br>
$ pmem 0 stat<br>
DEBUG<br>
$ pmem 0 pc<br>
0xbff<br>
$ pmem 0 rstack<br>
3 return addresses<br>
addr 0: 0x0005<br>
addr 1: 0x05a8<br>
addr 2: 0x0766<br>
$ pmem 0 cmd stp<br>
$ pmem 0 pc<br>
0xc00<br>
</code></p>
<p><em>Weeee!</em> <em>HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY!</em></p>
<p>You have no idea just how happy this made me. Yeah, I know, I'm overreacting. I'll tell you what: debug various kinds of hardware malfunction for several months, and you'll be able to identify with the warped notion of value one gains through such process. On second thought, I don't know if I'd really recommend it. Remember how I told <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html">low-level programming was easy</a>? It is, fundamentally, but there's this other angle from which it's quite a filthy endeavor. I promise to blog about it. I owe it to the people who keep telling me "so low-level is easy?" each time they listen to me swear heartily at a degenerate hardware setup where nothing works no matter what you try. I owe it to myself – me wants to reach a closure here. Why should I tolerate being regularly misquoted at the moments of my deepest professional catharsis?</p>
<p>Aaaanyway, in just N minutes, I bootstrapped myself something not unlike a retarded version of gdb, the way it would work if the symbol table of my program was stripped. But no matter – I have <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/addr2line1.html">addr2line</a> for that. And the nice thing about my retarded debugger front-end is that it looks like shell commands: <code>blah blah blah</code>. As opposed to <code>blah("blah","blah")</code>. And this, folks, is what I think Tcl, being a tool command language, gets right.</p>
<p>I come from the world of pop infix languages (C/Java/Python/Ruby/you name it). Tcl basically freaks me out with its two fundamental choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tcl likes literals, not variables.</strong> Tcl: <code>string, $var.</code> Pop infix: <code>"string", var</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tcl likes commands, not expressions.</strong> Tcl: <code>doit this that, [expr $this+$that]</code>. Pop infix: <code>doit("this","that"), this+that</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, pop infix languages (and I use the term in the most non-judgmental, factual way), pop infix languages are optimized for programming (duh, they are programming languages). Programming is definitions. Define a variable and it will be easy to use it, and computing hairy expressions from variables is also easy. Tcl is optimized for usage. Most of the time, users give simple commands. Command names and literal parameters are easy. If you are a sophisticated user, and you want to do <code>pmem 0 bkpt [expr [pmem 0 pc] + 1]</code>, go ahead and do it. A bit ugly, but on the other hand, simple commands are really, really simple.</p>
<p>And eventually, simple commands become all that matters for the user, because the sophisticated user grows personal shortcuts, which abstract away variables and expressions, so you end up with <code>pmem 0 bkpt nextpc</code> or something. Apparently, <em>flat function calls with literal arguments is what interactive program usage is all about.</em></p>
<p>I'm not saying that I'm going to use Tcl as the extension language of my next self-made lovecraftian toolchain (I was thinking more along the lines of doing that one in D and using D as my scripting language, 'cause it compiles fast enough and it's apparently high-level enough). I haven't thought enough about this, but the grotesque escaping/quoting in Tcl still freaks me out; I don't want to <em>program</em> like that. All I'm saying is that I like the <em>interactive</em> part. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short code matters a lot; short interactive commands matter <strong>much</strong> more.</li>
<li>An interactive command language must be a real language (loops, functions and all).</li>
<li>Tcl allows for the shortest commands and it's a real language. I'm <em>fascinated</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Short code vs short commands</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people have noticed that keeping your code short is extremely important. More surprisingly, many people fail to notice this, probably because "1 line is better than 5" doesn't sound that convincing. OK, think about 100K lines vs 500K and you'll get the idea. Oh, there are also those dirty Perl/shell one-liners that make one doubt about this. I've known a Bastard Programmer that used 2K bash one-liners as his weapon of choice. OK then, so the actual rule must be "short code is good unless it's written by a bastard". But it's the same core idea.</p>
<p>So we have the Architect type, who loves lots of classes which delegate work to each other, and we have the Enlightened type, who wants to write and read less. And the Enlightened type can rant and rave all day how Python, or Ruby, or Lisp make it oh-so-easy to define data structure literals, or to factor out stuff using meta-programming, or some other thing an Architect just never gets. And I'm all with it.</p>
<p>And then we have interactive shells. And in Python it's <code>doit("xx","yy")</code>. And in Lisp it's <code>(doit "xx" "yy")</code>, or <code>(doit :xx :yy)</code>, or <code>(doit xx yy)</code> if you make it a macro. And in Ruby it's <code>doit :xx :yy</code>, if you use symbols and omit parens. And that's about as good as you can get without using your own parser as in <code>doit "xx yy"</code>, which can suck in the (more rare) case when you do need to evaluate expressions before passing parameters, and doesn't completely remove overhead. Also note how all these languages use (), which makes you press Shift, instead of [] which doesn't. Ruby and Perl let you omit (), …</p></div></div>

September 5, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/">archive.org</a>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-3/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we finished adding
the rest of the constants as tagged pointer immediates. Since it’s not very
useful to have only values (no way to operate on them), we’re going to add some
<em>primitive unary functions</em>.</p>

<p>“Primitive” means here that they are built into the compiler, so we won’t
actually compile the call to an assembly procedure call. This is also called a
<em>compiler intrinsic</em>. “Unary” means the functions will take only one argument.
“Function” is a bit of a misnomer because these functions won’t be real values
that you can pass around as variables. You’ll only be able to use them as
literal names in calls.</p>

<p>Though we’re still not adding a reader/parser, we can imagine the syntax for
this looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>integer?</span> <span>(</span><span>integer-&gt;char</span> <span>(</span><span>add1</span> <span>96</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Today we also tackle <em>nested</em> function calls and subexpressions.</p>

<p>Adding function calls will require adding a new compiler datastructure, an
addition to the AST, but <em>not</em> to the compiled code. The compiled code will
still only know about the immediate types.</p>

<p>Ghuloum proposes we add the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add1</code>, which takes an integer and adds 1 to it</li>
  <li><code>sub1</code>, which takes an integer and subtracts 1 from it</li>
  <li><code>integer-&gt;char</code>, which takes an integer and converts it into a character
(like <code>chr</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>char-&gt;integer</code>, which takes a character and converts it into an integer
(like <code>ord</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>null?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>nil</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>zero?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>0</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>not</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>false</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>integer?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is an integer and
false otherwise</li>
  <li><code>bool?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is a boolean and
false otherwise</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions <code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, and the <code>char</code>/<code>integer</code> conversion functions
will be our first real experience dealing with object encoding in the compiled
code. What fun!</p>

<p>The implementations for <code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>integer</code>?, and <code>bool?</code> are so
similar that I am only going to reproduce one or two in this post. The rest
will be visible at
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/tekknolagi.github.com/blob/3d956655e48a124e828a8847282caa71b1c8b63f/assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c">assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c</a>.</p>

<p>In order to implement these functions, we’ll also need some more instructions
than <code>mov</code> and <code>ret</code>. Today we’ll add:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add</code></li>
  <li><code>sub</code></li>
  <li><code>shl</code></li>
  <li><code>shr</code></li>
  <li><code>or</code></li>
  <li><code>and</code></li>
  <li><code>cmp</code></li>
  <li><code>setcc</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the implementations of <code>shl</code>, <code>shr</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>and</code> are so
straightforward — just like <code>mov</code>, really — I’ll also omit them from the
post. The implementations of <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>cmp</code>, and <code>setcc</code> are more
interesting.</p>

<h3 id="the-fundamental-data-structure-of-lisp">The fundamental data structure of Lisp</h3>

<p>Pairs, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cells</a>,
two-tuples, and probably other things too, are the fundamental data structure
of Lisp. At least the original Lisp. Nowadays we have fancy structures like
vectors, too.</p>

<p>Pairs are a container for precisely two other objects. I’ll call them <code>car</code> and
<code>cdr</code> for historical<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and consistency reasons, but you can call them
whatever you like. Regardless of name, they could be represented as a C struct
like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is useful for holding pairs of objects (think coordinates, complex
numbers, …) but it is also incredibly useful for making linked lists. Linked
lists in Lisp are comprised of a <code>car</code> holding an object and the <code>cdr</code> holding
another list. Eventually the last <code>cdr</code> holds <code>nil</code>, signifying the end of the
list. Take a look at this handy diagram.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/lisp/03_lists_cons.svg">
  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cons cell list, courtesy of Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This represents the list <code>(list 42 69 613)</code>, which can also be denoted <code>(cons
42 (cons 69 (cons 613 nil)))</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll use these lists to represent the syntax trees for Lisp, so we’ll need to
implement pairs to compile list programs.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-pairs">Implementing pairs</h3>

<p>In previous posts we implemented the immediate types the same way in the
compiler and in the compiled code. I originally wrote this post doing the same
thing: manually laying out object offsets myself, reading and writing from
objects manually. The motivation was to get you familiar with the memory
layout in the compiled code, but ultimately it ended up being too much content
too fast. We’ll get to memory layouts when we start allocating pairs in the
compiled code.</p>

<p>In the compiler we’re going to use C structs instead of manual memory layout.
This makes the code a little bit easier to read. We’ll still tag the pointers,
though.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kPairTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1</span><span>;</span>        <span>// 0b001</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>0x7</span><span>);</span>  <span>// 0b000...0111</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>~</span><span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>;</span> <span>// 0b1111...1000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This adds the pair tag and some masks. As we noted in the previous posts, the
heap object tags are all in the lowest three bits of the pointer. We can mask
those out using this handy utility function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>uword</span> <span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>obj</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll need to use this whenever we want to actually access a struct member.
Speaking of struct members, here’s the definition of <code>Pair</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here are some functions for allocating and manipulating the <code>Pair</code> struct,
to keep the implementation details hidden:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>tag</span><span>,</span> <span>uword</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There a couple important things to note.</p>

<p>First, <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> very intentionally zeroes out the memory it allocates.
If the members were left uninitialized, it might be possible to read off a
struct member that had an invalid pointer in <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code>. If we
zero-initialize it, the member pointers represent the object <code>0</code> by default.
Nothing will crash.</p>

<p>Second, we keep moving our <code>ASTNode</code> pointers through <code>AST_as_pair</code>. This
function has two purposes: catch invalid uses (via the <code>assert</code> that the object
is indeed a <code>Pair</code>) and also mask out the lower bits. Otherwise we’d have to do
the masking in every operation individually.</p>

<p>Third, I abstracted out the <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> so we don’t expose the <code>calloc</code>
function everywhere. This allows us to later swap out the allocator for
something more intelligent, like a bump allocator, an arena allocator, etc.</p>

<p>And since memory allocated must eventually be freed, there’s a freeing function
too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>AST_is_heap_object</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_car</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_cdr</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>free</span><span>((</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This assumes that each <code>ASTNode*</code> owns the references to all of its members. So
<strong>don’t borrow references</strong> to share between objects. If you need to store a
reference to an object, <strong>make sure you own it</strong>. Otherwise you’ll get a double
free. In practice this shouldn’t bite us too much because each program is one
big tree.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-symbols">Implementing symbols</h3>

<p>We also need symbols! I mean, we could try mapping all the functions we need to
integers, but that wouldn’t be very fun. Who wants to try and debug a program
crashing on <code>function#67</code>? Not me. So let’s add a datatype that can represent
names of things.</p>

<p>As above, we’ll need to tag the pointers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x5</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 0b101</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then our struct definition.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>cstr</span><span>[];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve chosen this variable-length object representation because it’s similar to
how we’re going to allocate symbols in assembly and the mechanism in C isn’t so
gnarly. This struct indicates that the memory layout of a <code>Symbol</code> is a length
field immediately followed by that number of bytes in memory. Note that having
this variable array in a struct is a <strong>C99 feature</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t have C99 or don’t like this implementation, that’s fine. Just
store a <code>char*</code> and allocate another object for that string.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could also opt to not store the length <em>at all</em> and instead NUL-terminate
it. This has the advantage of not dealing with variable-length arrays (it’s
just a tagged <code>char*</code>) but has the disadvantage of an <code>O(n)</code> length lookup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we can add our <code>Symbol</code> allocator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>

<span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_new_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>data_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>strlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// for NUL</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>kSymbolTag</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>Symbol</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>
  <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>data_length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cstr</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>node</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how we have to manually specify the size we want. It’s a little fussy, but
it works.</p>

<p>Storing the NUL byte or not is up to you. It saves one byte per string if you
don’t, but it makes printing out strings in the debugger a bit of a pain since
you can’t just treat them like normal C strings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some Lisp implementations use a <em>symbol table</em> to ensure that symbols
allocated with equivalent C-string values return <em>the same pointer</em>. This
allows the implementations to test for symbol equality by testing pointer
equality. I think we can sacrifice a bit of memory and runtime speed for
implementation simplicity, so I’m not going to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s add the rest of the utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>node</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

    <p>This was originally posted on my personal blog in 2012.  It's still highly relevent today.</p>

<p>Who this is for: developers who have an idea.</p>

<p>Why you should read it: so you don’t waste your life by building something nobody wants.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I’m 35, and until last year, I started building companies by creating a product.</p>

<p>Last year, when starting SocialWOD, my biz partner Ryan refused to write code without first talking to 20+ customers and getting commitments to pay us money for a solution to a well-defined problem of theirs.</p>

<p>Having gone down the “build first” path enough without significant success, I was up for trying a new approach. Conceptually it seemed to make sense that we’d be able to better solve our customers’ problems if we understood their problems better.</p>

<p>To boot, we decided not to build until we had verbal financial commitments from customers for our proposed solution.</p>

<p>The result? <strong>We were able to charge money from day one for a two-screen CRUD app. We were able to do so because we had honed in on a specific problem worth paying for, and we had financial commitments before we wrote a single line of app code.</strong></p>

<p>Read on for some of the hard-earned lessons that’ll help you grow your biz.</p>
      <h2 id="dont-build-first">
        
        
          Don’t build first <a href="#dont-build-first">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Building first puts you at a disadvantage. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Your job as an entrepreneur is to increase the odds that your business will succeed. Put another way, your job is to reduce the risks that prevent your venture from succeeding.</p>

<p>There are several types of risk that can kill your company.</p>

<p>Big ones include (but aren’t limited to):</p>

<p>– Team (are <em>we</em> the right people to execute)
– Market (do people want to buy it) ← usually the biggest risk
– Technology (can we build it) ← most hackers start here. Oops.</p>

<p>I’m gonna talk about why most hackers start reducing the technology risk (by building a product) when they should start by reducing the market risk.</p>

<p>And I’m going to give you a script you can use in interviews to learn more about the market side of your biz.</p>

          Why people start with code <a href="#why-people-start-with-code">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>If you’re a developer, writing code is the fun part.  Code can be bent to your will to do what you want it to do. You know when it works, and when it doesn’t. It’s clean.</p>

<p>People have an innate desire for control, and code can be controlled.</p>

<p>Code is your comfort zone, so it’s what you (and I!) fall back on.</p>

<p>But since you can build almost certainly build the solution, it’s almost always the wrong place to start.</p>
    
      <h3 id="where-you-should-start">
        
        
          Where you should start <a href="#where-you-should-start">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<blockquote>“A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful.” – Paul Graham</blockquote>

<p>You should start by understanding your market.</p>

<p>This is vague. More precisely, you should understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who your customers are</li>
  <li>the specific problem your potential customers have</li>
  <li>why this is a problem for them</li>
  <li>how painful this problem is for them</li>
  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to do this is by talking to real live people: picking up the phone, going out to coffee, etc, asking good questions, and listening.</p>

<p>For most hackers, talking to customers to figure out their unmet needs is scary, and always messier than code. It’s out of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>The rational response is “Righty-o! Talk to customers first – that makes sense.”</p>

<p>The emotional response is “Oh shit. Who should I talk to? What should I say? Won’t I just be better off building this feature?”</p>

<p>The way I overcome this emotional trauma is to think about the insights I’ve gleaned from talking to customers in the past, and more importantly: <strong>how much time and frustration these conversations have saved me. Hackers hate working on stuff nobody uses.</strong></p>

<p>Really, it’s simple: the fastest way to build something people want is to understand their problems. And the fastest way to understand their problems is to listen to what they have to say.</p>

      </h2>

<p>Find some potential customers.</p>

<p>I may go into this in a future article, but finding a few individual customers in your market should <a href="https://www.reemer.com/articles/www.linkedin.com">be</a> <a href="https://www.reemer.com/articles/www.google.com">easy</a>.</p>

          What should I say? <a href="#what-should-i-say">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Here’s an template of an email we used at SocialWOD when referred to potential customers (we make software for CrossFit Gyms)</p>

<blockquote>Hi First_name,<p>

I spoke to referrer_full_name at referring_gym_name recently.</p><p>

He said you might be interested in sharing some insights about problem_we’re_solving, and hearing about what we’ve learned talking to your peers.</p><p>

I’m not trying to sell anything – just looking to learn about your business’s problems so I can build something that helps you grow your business.</p><p>

Cheers,</p><p>

your_name</p></blockquote>

<p>The keys to this email are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re promising to provide value (share some insights)</li>
  <li>You want to help them grow their business</li>
  <li>You’re not selling anything</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://smartfaststartup.com/2011/09/20/how-to-become-a-must-have/">Smart Fast Startup has a great cold-calling method to validate whether your idea solves a problem that people want to pay for.</a></p>

<p>This should get you a few meetings.</p>

          What to say in your meetings <a href="#what-to-say-in-your-meetings">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Your goal with these meetings should be to hone in on answers for each of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who your customers are</li>
  <li>the specific problem your potential customers have</li>
  <li>why this is a problem for them</li>
  <li>how painful this problem is for them</li>
  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say you had an idea about product for movie theater owners that would pipe buttered popcorn (and other) smells into theaters to help drive concession sales.</p>

<p>Here’s the sort of questions I would ask a theater owner:</p>

<p>Q: Tell me about your business. What are your biggest problems? What keeps you up at night? Why?</p>

<p>Trying to learn:
What are the big problems they have in their biz? Why are they problems? What happens when those problems aren’t solved?</p>

<p>Q: What are the key metrics that drive your business?
Trying to learn: What are the key levers in their biz – concession dollars per ticket sold? Straight up ticket sales? etc. Is your solution potentially a must-have or a nice to have?</p>

<p>Q: (if they don’t mention concessions) What impact do concessions have on your business?
Trying to learn: Is your solution even potentially valuable to them? How much, or why not? (Make sure you understand this. Keep unpeeling the onion; make sure you understand this fully. Try not to make assumptions here.)</p>

<p>Q: Have you looked at anything to help you with this problem? How have they worked for you? Where did you find them?
Trying to learn: Learning what else is out there? Are those solutions working, or not? What distribution channels might you need to be in?</p>

<p>Q: I have some ideas about products that might be useful. Can I give you a 1-liner description and you tell me if we’re crazy or may be on to something?
Trying to learn: This is to get a sense of whether your idea may even be valuable to them… you don’t want to get into specifics really, just tease them and get high-level feedback.</p>
    
      <h2 id="also-ask">
        
        
          Also ask: <a href="#also-ask">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Is it ok if I follow up as we develop our ideas? (I’ve never had anybody say no to this)</li>
  <li>Is there anybody else who you think we should speak to who have the same kinds of problems you do? (these are the people you call next)</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal with these interviews is to <em>listen</em> and <em>learn</em>, not to sell. Learn where you’re right, where you’re wrong, what words your customers use, what big problems they have, and how you can adapt your solution to solve those problems.</p>

<p>After a couple interviews you’ll be able to provide insight and become valuable to the people you’re speaking with, which makes you
even more trusted (“oh we just spoke to person XYZ at ABC corp… he was feeling the same pain, you’re not alone!” OR BETTER “just spoke to XYZ at ABC… he solved the problem you’re facing by doing 123”.)</p>

<p>And after 10-20 of these you’ll know a crap ton more about your market, and whether this is a problem even worth your time.</p>

<p>This process isn’t easy. But recurring themes will emerge that will help you hone in on a problem worth solving without writing a single line of code. The reason you do this first is because you need to do this whether you write code. You might as well do this <em>before</em> you spend a few months writing code, so you can figure out what to build.</p>

<p>Now that you better understand the problem and market, the next post will cover what you can do with that information (hint: it’s not “build the product”).</p>

	<p>I bet everybody knows this feeling when you get an interesting idea in your head, and 
you think – that is it! I need to do it! You start to dig into, but the first Google 
request shows that somebody has already implemented it. Bummer. I had one of those ideas
the other day.</p>

<p>Since around a year or a bit more, I am into running. For tracking my running time and 
routes I am using an application, of course. It is nice to look at some statistics. After
one of the runs, I looked at the route, and it reminded me of some figure or a drawing.
And then a thought came to me – what if we draw something  on a map while running using a 
GPS tracker?! Just imagine: a whole community running and sharing their routes!</p>

<p>My first deliberate attempt to draw during running was a letter “M“. It is supposed to be 
the first letter in either my wife’s name, or in the word “Metallica“. I’m not sure yet.</p>

<p>As it turned out, I am not the only one to come up with this idea. Drawing on a map with 
a GPS tracker is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_drawing">GPS Art</a>. It originated in 90s, and, of course, became more 
popular with a spread of mobile GPS devices. Check out hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gpsart&amp;src=typed_query">#gpsart</a>
on Twitter for inspiration.</p>

<p>The community also has its heroes. For example, the largest drawings on Earth belong to
Japanese artist Yasushi Takahashi. Here is a word “peace“… <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1nDdvPvZtyeh0a6uOxGTu7rEzRqI&amp;ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C26.488384499999995&amp;z=2">60,794 km long</a>.</p>

<div>
	<figure>

	</figure>
</div>

<p>And here is “Marry Me“ <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1m8Sevf2iWZT83ax5x2q6n8P8tBY&amp;ll=38.29853440547071%2C137.199813859375&amp;z=6">over the whole Japan</a>.</p>

<div>

	</figure>
</div>

<p>You can check out more of his work at <a href="http://gpsdrawing.info/">http://gpsdrawing.info/</a>.</p>

<p>But anyway, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So I guess I just go 
put my running shoes on and take a bunch of those single steps for now.</p>

						<p>Why do psychiatric conditions exist?</p>
<p>This question is both unsatisfyingly unanswered and incredibly important. Here we will consider some features of the over-century-long failure of psychiatry to explain mental disorders, before reviewing a theoretical framework which promises to explain these conditions in a way which is not only scientifically sound, but emancipating. The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is a practice with more than a chequered past, perpetrating horrors even in living memory: Sprees of lobotomising adults and children; purposefully inducing comas in schizophrenics, producing thrashing, spasming and salivating so bad that one psychiatrist reported the scene on a ward as alike to artist Gustave Dore’s depictions of hell; and the widespread demonisation of homosexuality justifying the electrocution and injection of homosexuals with nauseating drugs during slideshows of sexually attractive individuals of the same sex, hoping to train them into being sick at their own sexuality.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the decades have come more from the dismissal of old and harmful practices than the inception of new ones. As electrocution and nauseation were slowly recognised as both immoral and ineffective, we are now left with psychotherapies and pharmaceuticals of unreliable and underwhelming efficacy. Tens of billions of dollars and several decades of research have led to few new discoveries. Many drug developers have now left psychiatry for more easily understood and chemically pliable conditions of the body rather than the mind. Leaders in national mental health research have expressed dismay that so little progress has been made. Some research suggests that the burden of psychiatric illness might even be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.13083">worsening</a>, not lessening.</p>
<p>Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviourism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence">chemical imbalance theories</a> were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">long dismissed</a> in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227">a discipline in crisis</a>, surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorising.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his first edition of <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859, Charles Darwin prophesied: “In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”</p>
<p>Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.</p>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is the metatheory of biology, linking all species and all biological forms. The process of constant biological variation, reproduction and selection between forms leads to evolution of populations, explaining the form of our bodies and minds. Therefore, the logic of evolutionary medicine and psychiatry goes, evolutionary theory should also be referred to in explaining why our bodies and minds are vulnerable to disorder and disease. All biology is evolutionary, and psychiatry is biological, hence psychiatry should be understood in evolutionary terms. The lack of progress in understanding psychiatric disorders makes sense in this light, because mainstream psychiatry has been ignoring the key theory in biology.</p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles of evolutionary psychiatry have been defined, and important works <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-Bad-Feelings-Evolutionary-ebook/dp/B078VXFZCX">published</a>, there does not yet exist a dedicated evolutionary psychiatry university department or journal. In 2016, the first noteworthy institutional group dedicated to evolutionary psychiatry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046779/">was formed</a>, in the Evolutionary Psychiatry Special Interest Group (EPSIG) at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This slow start and long build up does not dissuade evolutionary psychiatrists from believing that, in the ever-less-distant future, this theoretical paradigm will be recognised as the way to truly start explaining mental disorder.</p>
<p>A unique advantage of evolutionary psychiatry is its ability to define disease and disorder upon an evolutionary concept of dysfunction. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), defines mental disorder as dysfunction, but then fails to specify what that means. This allows transparently unscientific activities. Most famously, in 1973, after gay rights protestors had stormed an APA meeting, psychiatrists had donned anonymising hoods and professed their personal homosexuality to a group of their fellows, and national progressive values became a little too loud to ignore, the APA called a vote to reconsider homosexuality’s status as a mental disorder. By a 58% majority, it was struck off.</p>
<p>Voting to decide whether a condition is a disease is not the sign of a mature science, yet to this day consensus alone is the deciding factor of whether a mind is deemed disorderly. Commonly prescribed disorder labels in use today, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, included in the DSM-III because of the vote of a dozen or so psychiatrists, have criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650639/">based primarily upon</a> single review papers with poor empirical evidence from the 1970’s – even the authors of that paper expected it to be backed up with further evidence before becoming part of canon. In the most recent edition, the DSM-5, ‘internet gaming disorder’ was suggested, justified by comparing online (but specifically excluding offline) gaming to drug and gambling addictions. An international consortium has since <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.12457">voted</a> clarifying its features. Evolutionary psychiatry can thankfully supersede this ambiguous line between order and disorder.</p>
<p>Unlike physics and chemistry, which describe things simply as they are, biological processes can be meaningfully considered to function or dysfunction. Biological traits evolved to increase reproductive success – that is their function. Eyes evolved to see, so eyes which cannot see are dysfunctional. Psychological and physical traits functioned to provide reproductive success to our ancestors, and where that function fails or is interrupted, there is dysfunction. Mental disorders can then be defined as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych242">harmful dysfunctions</a> of the mind.</p>
<p>This analysis of function is inevitably historical (it concerns ancestral evolutionary function, not modern functioning) and so is difficult to ascertain in many cases, especially in psychology, and is complicated by the possibility of random processes of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>. Nevertheless, this reference to evolutionary function is the <i>only</i> way to define function by an objective biological process rather than relying solely on subjective norms and cultural values – or indeed a vote.</p>
<p>This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">six reasons</a> why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.</li>
<li>Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.</li>
<li>Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.</li>
<li>Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.</li>
<li>Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.</li>
<li>Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.</p>
<p>Work in evolutionary psychiatry has considered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051086/">depression</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/1/5229271">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/hunters-in-a-farmers-world-adhd-and-hunter-gatherers-2332-0915-1000150.pdf">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16005572/">OCD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9875960/">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">substance use disorders</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674370304800107">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603205_In_cold_blood_The_evolution_of_psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, and many more disorders through the evolutionary framework. Several can be explained as mental tendencies related to adaptations which were advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors.</p>
<p>For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">Alcoholism and drug abuse</a> manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/">obesity</a> by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/">gambling addiction</a> is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavours.</p>

<p>Lots of people focus on living an objectively longer life by eating well and exercising.</p>



<p>But just as important is living a <em>subjectively</em> longer life, where every month or every year feels like a lifetime of experience. Itâ€™s eminently possible to affect oneâ€™s subjective sense of time, speeding it up or slowing it down. And you donâ€™t even have to set foot in a gym.</p>



<p>How can you make subjective time go slower? I will tell you.</p>



<p>First, routine is the enemy of slow subjective time. It will speed up subjective time enormously. No doubt youâ€™ve felt the feeling â€œwhere has the year gone?â€� and â€œtime speeds up as you get olderâ€�.</p>



<p>This is because of routine. Working the same job at the same place for the same hours week in and week out is what causes a year to flash by.</p>



<p>Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve noticed that 2020 has seemed longer than other years. I argue this is because of a disruption to so many of our routines.</p>



<p>My longest subjective year was the year I made myself homeless, and did a backpacking â€œstaycationâ€� in my home country, moving from place to place every few days in search of the next meal and the next bed, or at least floor, to sleep on. A year of doing this felt like it had the experience of ten years packed into it.</p>



<p>But why does a week long foreign holiday, which is not routine, feel like it has flashed by? Surely a week like that should feel long, but it doesnâ€™t? Well, let me backtrack and say it is not strictly â€œroutineâ€� that speeds up subjective time, rather it an absence of novelty. Novelty is what slows time down, and a routine is an engine for eliminating the unexpected, thereby eliminating novelty.</p>



<p>Many people take holidays in the same kind of way, doing the same kind of things in the same kind of places, year in and year out. A full time worker normally chooses a holiday to optimise relaxation, comfort and rest. Very little thatâ€™s unexpected or novel actually happens on a â€œrelaxingâ€� holiday, so the time flies by almost as fast as when youâ€™re at work. </p>



<p>Novelty makes the human brain pay attention. Something novel is something potentially life-changing, in both good and bad ways. Full focus, aliveness to the present moment and unusually clear memory all kick in when paying attention to something novel.</p>



<p>So the true antidote to subjective time speeding up is to inject new, different and surprising things into life. There is a compound effect here. Walking a different way to work once is not going to do much, but walking somewhere youâ€™ve never walked before every single week is much better. Doing something different in as many different categories as possible (taste something new, meet someone knew, think something new, go somewhere new, hate something newâ€¦ etc.) magnifies this effect further. It is what happened in my homeless year and what made that year feel so long.</p>



<p>Also, January.</p>



<p>The calendar year seems to me to be an ill fit for our subjective sense of time passing. New year being placed just after winter solstice seems wrong, how can one celebrate when hunkered down hoping for the sky gods to return? New Year should surely be in spring, as everything starts to me back alive. However, we can use this to our advantage for subjective time.</p>



<p>Iâ€™ve found that doing some kind of significant event (holiday, life goal) in January makes the subjective year seem much longer. Firstly January is a very long but productively dead month, normally lost to the mists of time. December is all about routine relaxation too. Wrestle back those 5 weeks with a significant event, which no doubt requires planning in December. That time goes from being dead and lost to being alive and significant.</p>



<p>Also, subjectively, January feels like <em>last year</em> because it was <em>before spring</em> however on the calendar it is in fact <em>this year</em>. Subjectively, the event is far away in time, back in the depths of winter, back before your summer life, which is so different now. Itâ€™s so far back it should be counted as last year, but it happened a mere 7 months ago, thus making what a â€œyearâ€� is seem to stretch out in subjective memory.</p>



<p>Some other more minor techniques to play around with are those of stories, drugs and being bored. Mental time is different to clock time, and these techniques make use of that.</p>



<p>Stories allow us to live an entire lifetime in the shoes of a character, but consuming the story takes only a couple of hours. Drugs can speed up or slow down mental time, psychedelics being the most notable for slowing time down (likely due to the novelty of the senses during that time). Being bored is excruciating. We will do anything for distraction. But boredomâ€™s ability to slow down the minutes, every moment like dragging through treacle, can make an hour or day seem very long. The downside of boredom is that weâ€™re unlikely to keep strong memories of it, unless something surprising happens.</p>



<p>I suggest investing some time in deliberately slowing time down. A longer life is the reward.</p>

<p><span>Abstract</span></p>
<p>
Physics-based rendering algorithms generate photorealistic images by simulating the flow of light through a detailed mathematical representation of a virtual scene. In contrast, <b>physics-based differentiable rendering</b> algorithms focus on computing derivative of images exhibiting complex light transport effects (e.g., soft shadows, interreflection, and caustics) with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, object geometry (e.g., vertex positions) as well as spatially varying material properties expressed as 2D textures and 3D volumes. This new level of generality has made physics-based differentiable rendering a key ingredient for solving many challenging inverse-rendering problems, that is, the search of scene configurations optimizing user-specified objective functions, using gradient-based methods
</p>
<p>
Further, these techniques can be incorporated into probabilistic inference and machine learning pipelines. For instance, differentiable renderers allow "rendering losses" to be computed with complex light transport effects captured. Additionally, they can be used as generative models that synthesize photorealistic images.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Challenges.</b></u> Compared to its "ordinary" counterpart, physics-based differentiable rendering introduces unique theoretical and practical challenges. For instance, practical problems can involve many (e.g., 10<sup>6</sup>--10<sup>10</sup>) parameters, making simple techniques for differentiation such as finite differences impractical. More advanced tools for automatic differentiation (e.g., <tt>PyTorch</tt> or <tt>Tensorflow</tt>) record a graph of intermediate computation steps that tends to become prohibitively large. Lastly, geometric derivatives involve a unique challenge: boundaries of objects introduce troublesome discontinuities during the computation of shadows and interreflections that lead to incorrect gradients if precautions are not taken. Thankfully, recent advances in physics-based differentiable rendering theory have enabled the differentiation of radiometric measurements with respect to arbitrary scene parameters as well as unbiased Monte Carlo estimators. <b>In this course, we provide an in-depth introduction to general-purpose physics-based differentiable rendering.</b>

They found a niche and they are crazy expensive, but if you look at their sales it seems like nobody minds that.</p><p>Instead of packing more and more features, they are stripping everything to the bare bones and stick to simplicity. The majority of their notebooks is plain black, with a small logo embossed on the backside. The pages of their notebooks have nothing but a grid of dots on them, which is unusual for a journal - no date field, no calendar, nothing - just a big empty piece of paper.</p><h2>How they make you feel good about paying $20 for a notebook</h2><p>Every time you buy a Moleskine notebook, you get this small book that tells you a short story about their brand and what’s the story behind the notebook.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_RmkEDKsNItfpfIlR/assets/OKIRVVaPzisoUdaI.png" alt="Artboard 2.png"></p><p>The text inside this notebook writes:</p><blockquote><em>Today the Moleskine brand identifies a series of objects that accompany the creativity and imagination of our world. The very first of these objects was a small black notebook, born from a great tradition.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The Moleskine notebook is the heir and successor to the legendary notebook used by artists and thinkers over the past two centuries: among them Vincent van Gog, Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Bruce Chatwin. A simple black rectangle with rounded corners, an elastic page-holder, and an internal expandable pocket: a nameless object with a spare perfection all of its own, produced for a century by a small French bookbinder who supplied the stationery shops in Paris, where the artistic and literary avant-garde of the world browed and bought them. A trusted and handy travel companion, the notebook has held invaluable sketches, notes, stories and ideas that would one day become famous paintings, or the pages of beloved books.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>……..</em></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>This little piece of text is how they are making those 20$ worth. It’s not about the notebook - it’s about the heritage and the story behind the brand. It doesn’t even have to be true, it feels great!</p><p>When i first read this text it made me feel like a pack of a tribe, i mean if Pablo Picasso used a notebook like this who am i not to use it? I want to be like Pablo Picasso!&nbsp;</p><p>The Moleskine brand is creating a strong tribe around it’s brand and they are counting on that when forming prices. They actually created a market for their product and they are owning it. The Moleskine tribe is willing to pay a premium just to feel like a part of a pack of thinkers, creatives and great people - even if this notebook sometimes ends up filled with random doodles.</p><p>The Moleskine marketing team knows exactly who their customers are and they are feeding them with the stories that spark their imagination about who they might become. Every time you buy a new Moleskine notebook it feels like a new chance to do something great, and the old journal you filled out feels like a part of your life - archived.</p><h2>How can you apply this to your brand</h2><p>You need to create a tribe around your brand, and they have to be crazy about your product.&nbsp;</p><p>Just your average fans won’t do it. I love Samsung, but if i had to pay $2000 for their phone i wouldn’t do it. On the other hand, I just bought my second Moleskine journal.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a process that takes a lot of time but if you plan on selling high priced products this is the best way to ensure that people don’t notice the price tag.</p><p>You can start by creating a community, but it has to be an active community where both the members interact with each other and you interact with the members as a brand. These can be subreddits, FB groups, YT channels - there are a lot of ways.</p><p>Storytelling is a powerful tool, and if you create a story behind your brand it can be a great way for people to connect to your brand. Try hooning your story about your brand to your target customer, what from your story is important to them? Use this to your advantage.</p><p>Having a fateful tribe is the only way to have die-hard fans. Look at Apple, a big portion of their products is overpriced BUT it feels amazing to use them, and you feel like a part of something bigger; Moleskine is the same example.</p><p>If you start building your tribe now, your potential can be limitless; so start creating your story today!</p><p>If you wish to explain what your product is - this can be done in just a few minutes with a promo video made with <a href="https://plainly.shop/">Plainly.</a> This is a tool that allows you to easily generate a promo video for a product in just a few minutes - <a href="https://plainly.shop/browse-templates">pick a template</a>, fill in the data and get your video done quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://plainly.shop/generate-video">Generate a video for your product now - it’s free!</a></p><p>I really appreciate you taking your time and reading this - thanks a lot!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>After years of using LibreOffice, I’ve now switched over to ONLYOFFICE and recommend it over any other office suite on Linux. Now I know a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> enthusiasts will be unhappy about the idealistic part of the recommendation, but hear me out.</p>



<h2><strong>Top notch Microsoft Office compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>I’m a<a href="https://jatan.space/"> science writer</a> who uses Linux because it just functions better for me than Windows or macOS and because I’m an open source enthusiast. Given my profession, I have to frequently collaborate with people on other operating systems who almost always use either Microsoft Office or Google Docs. After three years of trying, I can tell you that LibreOffice just doesn’t cut it. Either me or the other person will lose some formatting in the documents at some point. And as a document travels from one computer to another, things quickly become a mess.</p>



<p>That is when I found ONLYOFFICE. In over a year of using it, I’ve sent ONLYOFFICE created documents, spreadsheets and presentations to people using Microsoft Office, iWork, smartphone editors, Google Docs, etc., did multiple to and fro edits and it hasn’t broken <em>a single thing</em>! This is something I cannot ignore as a writer and my experience attests to ONLYOFFICE’s claim of top notch Microsoft Office compatibility.</p>



<h2><strong>More features</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond the excellent compatibility with Microsoft Office files, there are other features that make ONLYOFFICE a better alternative to LibreOffice, WPS or any other Linux office suite that I’ve used.</p>



<ul><li>All documents open in the same window as multiple tabs and you can manipulate them just like you’d in a browser. This is amazing.</li><li>Can connect to Nextcloud or OwnCloud for online and collaborative features like Google Docs.</li><li>Unlike LibreOffice, ONLYOFFICE has adequately functional and maintained mobile &amp; tablet apps on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onlyoffice.documents">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onlyoffice-documents/id944896972">iOS</a>.</li><li>Has Ribbon UI, so in my opinion things are easier to find on ONLYOFFICE compared to LibreOffice’s <strong>“Default”</strong> UI.</li><li>Open source, making it more trustworthy than WPS Office and other proprietary solutions on Linux.</li><li>Available on Windows and macOS too if you don’t want to use Microsoft Office or simply can’t afford its licensing fee.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Go get it</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200" alt="" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=400 400w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></figure></div>



<p>ONLYOFFICE is officially available to <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-desktop.aspx">download</a> on Linux as a Deb, RPM, Flatpak and a Snap package so you can use it on any Linux distro you like!</p>



<p>I hope I’ve convinced you to give ONLYOFFICE a shot and see if it solves your problems. If it doesn’t, you can file bugs and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors">their GitHub repository</a>. In my experience, they’ve been very open to feature suggestions and prompt on bug fixes.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>My ideals for FOSS dwindled swiftly when I had to make something work in the real world. Not everyone can use everything truly FOSS all the time. At least ONLYOFFICE is open source (<a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors/blob/master/LICENSE">AGPL-3.0, specifically</a>) and not proprietary like Microsoft Office. Bottomline, ONLYOFFICE is a fantastic office suite that I hope more people discover.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been listening to podcasts and one of my favourites is <a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Masters of Scale</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/reidhoffman" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reid Hoffman</a>, in this episode he talks about growth of Shopify and how it became a <strong>platform</strong>.
We all know <a href="https://shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a> is one of the best platforms out there to build your business online. In the early stages of Shopify, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tobi</a> mentions how they had left a large piece of pie which could have been their’s, to the third-party app developers by opening up an App Store for Merchants.
This decision not only helped Shopify get off the ground but also was the reason for their amazing growth. </p>
<p>Tobi also mentions how they restrained themselves from building the whole product, ie, 100% for a particular use-case. Instead they built to 80% which is common for all use-cases (core-features) and the gap of rest 20% is filled by the Shopify marketplace where the
third-party apps come in. This created a demand for both merchants and developers.</p>

<p>As said by Reid: “Merchants were attracted by the ever-growing range of features, while developers were attracted by the ever-growing demand from merchants for apps.
And this is one of the biggest strengths of a platform: you can rapidly respond to that long tail of user needs. And this puts your virtuous cycle into high gear.”</p>
<p>This virtuous cycle is what most solutions strive for and this is what turns a solution into a platform. Now that I look around, there are so many platforms which run on this virtuous cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Google and Apple App Stores - Third Party Developers - Android/iOS Users</li>
<li>Wordpress - Wordpress Marketplace (themes, plugins) - Content Creators</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Marketplace (themes, extensions) - Programmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Even this blog which I built using <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GatsbyJS</a> framework would eventually want to become a platform. They already have an awesome plugins system and themes in place.</p>
<hr>
<p>A gem I picked up from the episode is a term called “Bill Gates Line”: “You are not a platform until the people who are building on you make more money than you do.”</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>(Updated 2020-09-06 with pointers to related work and a bit more explanation)</p>

<p>This is a bit of a followup to <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/personal/2018/05/10/toward-gpu-json-parsing.html">Towards GPGPU JSON parsing</a>. That proposed a rather roundabout way to parallelize a simple parsing task. Having had more GPU programming experience under my belt, I don’t expect that particular approach to work well, but it did suggest that parallelism exists in the problem.</p>

<p>This post is a writeup of a new idea, but with a caution, no implementation. It probably contains some mistakes, and maybe the idea is flawed. But if it holds up, I think it’s an exciting line of research on how to port sequential algorithms to GPU.</p>

<p>For this post, I’m going to pose an even more simplified version of the problem: for each open bracket, record the index of the parent in the parse tree, and for each close bracket, the index of the corresponding open bracket.</p>

<p>This is a simple sequential program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>stack</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>None</span><span>]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>token</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span><span>:</span>
        <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>stack</span><span>[</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>stack</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>'['</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>']'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To follow the running example from the JSON post, assume the input <code>[[][[][][[]]][][]]</code>. The result is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>index 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
input [  [  ]  [  [  ]  [  ]  [  [  ]  ]  ]  [  ]  [  ]  ]
value -  0  1  0  3  4  3  6  3  8  9  8  3  0 13  0 15  0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can it be parallelized? It’s challenging to see how, as there are dependencies on previous state. Further, the state itself has unbounded size. It can be O(n); a pathological case is a million open brackets followed by a million close. In practice, depending on the workloads, we might expect more modest nesting depth, but ideally we’d like an algorithm that can handle all cases at least reasonably well.</p>

<p>Maybe we can do something. To longtime readers of my blog (and the “rope science” series before that), it will be no surprise I’ll try to use monoids.</p>

<p>So let’s turn this sequential program into a monoid. If I had a time portal, I’d lens forward in time and use the handy automated tool that some enterprising PhD student will has done by then. But, failing that, I’ll do it in my head.</p>

<p>The monoid is basically a sequence of pops followed by a sequence of pushes. Since the pop operations (in this case) don’t have a payload, they can be represented simply as a count. So the monoid is the pair <code>(n_pops, elements)</code>. The primitive for push is <code>(0, [element])</code>, and for pop it’s <code>(1, [])</code>. The monoid operation is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>combine</span><span>(</span><span>m1</span><span>,</span> <span>m2</span><span>):</span>

<p>And of course, the identity element is <code>(0, [])</code>. One intuition for this monoid is that it represents a function from the state at the beginning of a sequence of tokens to the state at the end. If it indeed computes this function for arbitrary subsequences, then it it follows that it’s a monoid from the fact that function composition is associative.</p>

<p>Running scan, or generalized <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2020/04/30/prefix-sum.html">prefix sum</a>, on this monoid, will result in the desired result at the top of the stack, i.e. the last element of the sequence in the monoid.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that this monoid is associative.</p>

<p>I do believe that an automated tool for translating these kinds of simple sequential programs is possible, and that there’s a theory behind it that illuminates ways in which monoids do and do not compose. Some composition is possible, for example you could fairly easily extend this idea so that each child knows its sequence number relative to its siblings. To do that, blend in the “counting monoid,” which is just integer addition.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Extend the monoid to handle sequence numbers.</p>

<p>If we had a bound on stack depth, we’d be pretty well set. The problem is the unbounded case. My original thinking was to have a window of (let’s say size k) elements, and each pass would handle a slice of the stack of size k. I think this can be made to work, but at heart it requires a number of passes proportional to stack depth, so in the worst case O(n^2).</p>

<p>My new idea is to retain the single pass scan, but use a purpose-built data structure to represent the stack. At the top is a window of k elements, then after that is a linked list (or perhaps a linked list of chunks; honestly I haven’t worked through all the implications, much less actually implemented and done performance measurement).</p>

<p>The combine operation tries to fit the new combined sequence in the window (up to a shared link, which it can just retain). But if it overflows, then it must allocate, most likely using an atomic bump allocator into global memory, as is often done in piet-gpu.</p>

<h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance analysis</h2>

<p>To do a <em>real</em> performance analysis would require an implementation, but it should be possible to reason about it a bit.</p>

<p>Clearly performance will be excellent if stack depth is shallow. The rate at which the linked list will be invoked will depend on the workload, and also the parallelism patterns. It’s worth noting that if the scan is run sequentially, then the linked list operations will always be cheap. This is because the concatenation at the heart of the monoid operation is <em>asymmetrical</em> when using a linked list - a large sequence on the left is cheap when the sequence on the right is small, but not the other way around. When running the scan purely sequentially, the monoid on the right is always of size 1 at most.</p>

<p>And the decoupled lookback implementation of scan, which is state of the art, runs essentially sequentially at large granularity; it just tries to exploit as much parallelism as the hardware provides at smaller granularity. Even with extremly deep nesting, it should build and retain a linked list of the stack as it scans, with a relatively smaller window for the part of the problem currently in flight.</p>

<p>There is another reason to be optimistic about performance. While the bandwidth of communication between partitions scales with the window size, that’s not necessarily true for processing <em>within</em> a partition. Putting aside for a moment the relatively challenging problem of implementing an efficient GPU kernel (which by necessity would exploit SIMD parallelism), consider a decoupled look-back implementation running on a more traditional multicore CPU, where each thread is sequential.</p>

<p>Basically, the first pass runs the traditional, sequential stack algorithm, with the modification that some of the input stack might not be available. At the end is the monoid, with “n_pops” being a count of the number of times that happened, and the sequence containing all the elements pushed inside that partition.</p>

<p>In the decoupled lookback phase, this monoid is published for consumption of partitions to the right, and the partition also computes the aggregate from partitions to the left. The cost of the monoid operations in this phase <em>will</em> be proportional to the size of the window, but keep in mind that the number of aggregates is orders of magnitude less than the number of elements.</p>

<p>Finally, in the second pass over the elements, the stack algorithm is run again, and this time elements that were missing in the first pass are available, from the aggregate obtained during the decoupled lookback phase. As another potential optimization, the second pass might “jump over” subtrees that were computed entirely locally within the partition in the first pass, only doing work on subtrees that cross partition boundaries.</p>

<p>Thus, my analysis is that the work factor is <em>extremely</em> good for this algorithm, meaning that on a 64 core processor, it might come within striking distance of 64 times faster than a single core sequential implementation (obviously modulo all the usual other factors that make this challenging).</p>

<p>As I mentioned, an efficient GPU kernel is likely to be challenging, probably requiring tricky techniques to exploit SIMD (warp) parallelism without spending too much time computing the monoid composition, but the fact that it seems to work so well in the multicore case is an encouraging sign that an efficient, fully GPU-tuned implementation is possible.</p>



<p>In an earlier draft, I asked for relevant literature related to this idea. I still haven’t found anything that presents this particular monoid, or a tool that can derive it from its sequential source, but there is a fair amount of related work.</p>

<p>Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is an important exploration of deriving more parallelism from the JSON parsing task, with impressive results. It is, I think, complementary to this exploration, as it exploits parallelism at a fine grain, where this monoid approach is geared towards the larger grain of tree structure. But both are necessary for a performant GPU implementation; anyone intending to really parse JSON on GPU is well advised to study it.</p>

<p>Parsing CSV has some of the same problems as JSON, though not the (potentially deeply) nested tree structure. A recent preprint, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13415.pdf">ParPaRaw: Massively Parallel Parsing of Delimiter-Separated Raw Data</a> presents a GPU implementation.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/1512">PR to cudf</a> implements “JSON Lines” parsing, which seems to me more similar to CSV than full tree-structured JSON parsing, but I haven’t dug into it in detail.</p>

<p>There is also a large literature on incremental parsing, which is related to parallel parsing as well (monoids are useful to both); a relevant example is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/efficient-parallel-and-incremental-parsing-of-practical-contextfree-languages/4D620F0BFADE2B588F854AAAEA252F5C">Efficient parallel and incremental parsing of practical context-free languages</a>.</p>

<p>I linked it in my previous blog, but <a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/24749">Aaron Hsu’s PhD thesis</a> is a remarkable full compiler implementation (for an APL-derived language) on GPU. It <em>does</em> address tree structure, and I believe generally uses adjacency matrices to represent that.</p>

<p>An interesting paper on converting a sequential program into a monoid is <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3018882.3018891">Functional Parallels of Sequential Imperatives</a>, and that has a lot of pointers into other literature. I haven’t (yet) read it carefully enough to know whether it could derive the monoid stated above. …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>
through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.
</p>

<div>

</div>

<p>
That's it! The network is ready to learn.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

   <img alt="ADHD mind" src="https://www.kabdebon.com/assets/images/posts/2020-08-25-creative-mayhem-life-as-founder-with-adhd/adhdmind.png">
</p>

<p>This article took me four weeks to finish. During this time, I’ve had ideas for more than ten articles, started writing them in parallel, delaying this one so much that I almost gave up ever publishing it… It wasn’t until I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention-ebook/dp/B005GFII62">Driven To Distraction</a> that I stumbled upon an explanation for why I was struggling to finish. Through this book and my doctor, I’ve discovered that I have a condition called Adult ADHD.</p>

<p>While the adult variant of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Adult_ADHD_Diagnostic_Expansion">recently</a> started to become a serious subject of research, it’s difficult to find testimonies about it related to work, in particular entrepreneurship. Early results show that there’s a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-018-0061-1">positive correlation between ADHD and the desire and act to start a company</a>. I’ll share how adult ADHD can affect a founder’s experience and how it played a role in the successes and stumbles of my life as the cofounder and CTO of <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backstory-and-the-entrepreneurship-drive">Backstory and the entrepreneurship drive</h2>

<p>From an early age, I had trouble remembering important things like my birthday (learned around age 7), how to tie shoes (learned age 12), or even why I entered a room in the first place (to this day, this keeps happening). All the way to the end of high school, getting good grades was easy. However, early signs of difficulty focusing popped up here and there: even when required to, I wasn’t able to sit down and learn. For example, in France, students must memorize entire poems, then are expected to recite it back the next day. As hard as I tried, when I stepped in front of the class my mind remained blank, unable to recall the words I had tried to learn the day before. The teacher, exasperated by my silence, called me “lazy” and “rebellious.”</p>

<p>After high school, I was accepted into the best schools in France. Difficulties focusing on homework became more problematic as advanced maths, physics, and chemistry required deeper focus and concentration to understand complex topics. My grades were now in the middle of the class instead of being at the top. For the first time, I started to feel the deep frustration of not being able to focus when I needed it.</p>

<p>As I started my professional life, things became more interesting. I was hired as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn and finally, it was an environment where my creativity could be unleashed. I suffered from “too-many-project-itis”, a made-up condition for engineers who start too many projects and finish too few. I learned to let go of most of them while focusing on the ones that would yield tangible results. Eventually, one of these ideas, a place to get verified information about people, motivated me enough to want to stop working at a big company and create a company that became a real startup: <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<p>The pressure of long hours and stress to find product-market fit during early startup days pushed my mind to new highs and lows. What I thought were quirks of my personality quickly became signs that something in my brain was different than my peers. These inherent differences, while frustrating at times, also led to surprising successes for our business. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878">Adult ADHD symptoms</a> fall into three categories as they relate to an entrepreneur’s experiences:  the <em>Good</em>, the <em>Bad</em>, and the <em>Ugly</em>. Just like in the famous scene they will, throughout your life, face each other or even duel at times: it’s your responsibility to have the “Good” win.</p>

<p>
   <img alt="Scene from the good, the bad and the ugly" src="https://www.kabdebon.com/assets/images/posts/2020-08-25-creative-mayhem-life-as-founder-with-adhd/thegoodthebadtheugly.jpg">
</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>“The bad” are the parts of ADHD that are not pleasant to deal with, for you or others. These behaviors, if not dealt with, will be a challenge to your success as an entrepreneur.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anxiety</strong>. <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.4.716?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;">Research shows that close to one in two people with ADHD suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder</a>. As with most ADHD symptoms, it’s hard to predict how anxiety will show up in your life. For me, it’s heightened stress during unexpected events, like the departure of a key employee or a serious bug in the code. In these moments, I need to remind myself that it’s OK and surround myself with people who can keep their heads on their shoulders. 
In fact, to cope with anxiety, I’ve built a comprehensive incident management system that we use daily at Truework. Research has a name for it: <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/10/three-leadership-skills-that-c">productive paranoia</a>, an attribute that distinguishes companies that thrive in chaos instead of suffering from it. Anxiety is rarely talked about in entrepreneurship stories, but in my experience is very common. If channeled constructively, it’ll help build defense mechanisms for when bad news strikes. Remember, the journey to build a business is a rocky one and it’ll certainly trigger intense moments of anxiety and doubts.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of filter</strong>. “insensitive”, “harsh”, “direct”: if you have ADHD, you’ve probably heard these comments about your behavior. For founders, the difference between a successful outcome and a disastrous one often lies in how carefully you choose your words. Over time I’ve trained myself to consciously think before speaking: no more “thinking out loud” in front of my reports. You may need to reach into the depths of your willpower to stop yourself from blurting words that may get you in trouble, but trust me, it’s worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>

<p>“The ugly” parts are the frustrations of daily life. They’ll make you feel a bit “different” from others or “off”.  I’ve found they have little impact on my journey as a founder but instead can bring your enthusiasm and confidence down. Keeping them under control will improve your overall well being as a person which is very important for founders.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem of focus</strong>. This is the first thing people think about when they think ADHD, and with good reason. It’s difficult to describe to a non-ADHD person how quickly the ADHD brain gets distracted. For me, any notification will stop me from writing an important article or work on an important task. For founders, tasks calling for your attention and interruptions will grow exponentially with the size of the company. While disturbing to most people, it can be absolutely overwhelming for people with adult ADHD. Keep it simple: turn off all notifications or go back to pen and paper when deep focus is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Time management</strong>. Being at a meeting on time, being ready for the meeting, planning in advance. These tasks are not easy for a person with ADHD. Before most deadlines, I seem to remember to do everything but the task I’m supposed to do. Time management is a crucial skill for founders and soon after you start your company your calendar will fill with dozens of meetings and other obligations per week. I’ve found it’s best to hire and rely early on somebody that can help you with organization. Alternatively, reminders, TODO lists, and other software can help you stay on top of tasks and meetings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>Finally with the “the good” parts. Let me preface this part by saying that the qualities listed below are not superpowers. But they may give you an edge in specific situations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deep Focus</strong>. It appears to contradict the part above about the lack of focus, but people with ADHD <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus#ADHD">report having an ability to deeply focus on topics they are passionate about</a>. Currently, I’m reading everything I can get my hands on about the topic of documentation, in particular knowledge organization. I often lose track of time after sitting down with a compelling article and forget to eat a meal As founders start their journeys, they face incredible challenges: only the passion for their work will allow them to continue and overcome obstacles. Founders who are able to channel that “hyperfocus” towards the company’s future will leapfrog their competitors and be the engine that drives their company’s vision forward.</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity</strong>. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-creativity-of-adhd/">Research</a> points out that adults with ADHD show a higher level of creativity compared to other people. It’s been my observation that it has been easier for me to think “outside the box” when faced with a difficult problem than a lot of my peers. For founders, this is an advantage that they need to nurture in themselves, as success for a startup lies in doing things in a way that wasn’t thought possible before.</li>
  <li><strong>Impulsivity/Gut Feeling</strong>. The lack of filter which sometimes negatively impacts personal and professional relationships has a positive aspect as well. The life of a founder is punctuated by moments when it’s necessary to make an important decision with only partial information. It’s crucial to get over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">“analysis paralysis”</a> and trust your instinct. When hiring the first few people who will come to define your company, you’ll need to make a decision of who to bring on board. Trust your gut and go with the people that you think will make you successful.</li>
  <li><strong>Appetite for risk</strong>. Last but not least a rarely discussed aspect of adult ADHD is an above-average appetite for risk. This characteristic is of course essential to even start a business as a founder where nothing is for certain. As you grow, that “risk mindset” will be crucial to keep the company from playing it too safe after finding some initial success. For founders, pushing the boundaries is a requirement to survive as you grow.</li>
</ul>

<p>ADHD traits, described by the media, seem largely dysfunctional. While there’s some truth to it, they affect a founder’s life in contradictory ways: one day you’ll be extremely anxious and wondering why you took the leap in the first place, and the next you’ll be riding high, loving the risk of being an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>It’s too easy to let yourself be defined by the conditions you are born with and see them as roadblocks to your success. With most things in life you don’t get to choose what you’re born with, only what actions you take: if you want to become a founder, ADHD is just one of the problems you’ll need to solve along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Test Driven Development is a principle of software development that ensure your code work exactly as you want it, it is a principle that should be follow by every development although there are lot of people who are yet to follow the principle, But if you did not follow test driven development then you will follow debug later development.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>It makes debugging easier: </strong>Just imagine their is a bug or issue in your codebase with test driven development approach, your test cases will definitely fail and you will know exactly where to look, what to look for and what to modify. it makes development more easier.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It works the way you wanted it: </strong>Test Driven Development helps and ensure your code works exactly the way you want it.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="unit-test">Unit Test</h2>
<p>Unit test is a type of software development testing where individual/unit component of a software are tested. The process is done during the development of an application, to ensure and verify the correctness of a units/component of code.</p>
<h2 id="integration-test">Integration Test</h2>
<p>Integration test is the process of testing collection/group of unit/component. Integration test is done upon completion of unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="acceptance-e2e-end-to-end-test">Acceptance/E2E(end to end) Test</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. The purpose of carrying out end-to-end tests is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 3 cycle behind test Driven Development,Red, Green and Refactor just like there are 3 cycle behind traffic light control red, yellow and green.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Red:</strong> write a test and it fail</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Green:</strong> write a test for a functionality and make sure it pass the test</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Refactor:</strong> Optimizing the previous passed test and make sure all test cases pass.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-install-jest-in-your-javascript-project">How to install jest in your Javascript Project</h2>
<p>using yarn you install jest with below code</p>
<pre><code><span>yarn</span> add --dev jest
</code></pre><p>using npm you can install jest with below code</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>install</span> 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>expect: </strong> When you're writing tests, you often need to check that the values met certain conditions. expect gives you access to a number of "matchers" that let you validate different things. expect accept a value(a value you want to check against what you are expecting).</p>
<p><strong>E.g</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>expect</span>(sum(<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>)).toBe(<span>3</span>);
<span>expect</span>(sum(<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>)).toBeA(number);
<span>expect</span>(sum(<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>).toEqual(<span>3</span>);
</code></pre><p>expect function has some matcher you can use and chain with in jest. such as <em>.toBe()</em> , toBeA , toEqual ,toContainEqual e.t.c. check the  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect.html">official documentation</a>  for more expect matchers.</p>
<p><strong>test/it:</strong> test or it is a function that run the test, it allows you to test your unit function For Example. Let Say there is a function called sum that accept two parameter and return the addition of the parameters.</p>
<pre><code>test(<span>'Sum of two numbers'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
 expect(Sum(<span>5</span>,<span>9</span>)).toBe(<span>14</span>); }
);
</code></pre><p>check the official documentation for matcher.</p>

<p>initialize javascript project with npm using your terminal</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span> --y
</code></pre><p>install jest into your project using terminal</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>install</span> 
</code></pre><p>NB: You can create your test file with .test.js extension which will allows jest to locate your file and run your test cases. To organise and structure your project you can create a folder with the name <strong>test</strong> in your project directory which will house all test cases file.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Let assume you are given a task to write a function that will accept two values as a parameter and sum the two values. the question now is what should you test for. There are lot of things to test for all you need to do is to think about what kind of output/result you want to return to the user. Below are what you can test for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Test if the parameters value is number data type, if it is not a number then the test should fail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Test if the sum of parameter a and parameter b is logically correct, if not the test should fail.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB: </strong> If you want your parameter should accept array and also sum the array. you can write a test case that check if the user supply array as a parameter and check if it does return correct answer.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>There are two way to TDD either you write your test cases first before you actually start your development or write test cases later after development but the best practice is test case first then development. that's the approach we are going to follow now.</p>
<p>Let create a folder called <strong>test</strong> in root level of our project, inside the folder create a file called sum.test.js, all our test cases for sum function will be in the file.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> <em>I will be using commonJS, you can use and configure your project to use babel, if it's already configured with babel so all is good</em></p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> { sum } = <span>require</span>(<span>"./sum"</span>);
describe(<span>'Addition of Two Number functionality test'</span>,<span><span>()</span>=&gt;</span>{
test(<span>"Add 1 + 2 should be 3"</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
expect(sum(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>)).toBe(<span>3</span>);
expect(sum(<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>)).toBeA(<span>number</span>);
});
test(<span>"it should fail if string as parameter"</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
expect(sum(<span>"Hello"</span>, <span>"World"</span>))
.toEqual(<span>Error</span>(<span>"Expecting number type as parameter"</span>));
});
});
</code></pre>
<p>First test case will check if first parameter and second parameter value return correct answer. i.e if 1+2 equal to 3.</p>
<pre><code>test(<span>"Add 1+2 should be 3"</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
expect(sum(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>)).toBe(<span>3</span>);
});
</code></pre><p>Second test case will check if first parameter or second parameter value is string and return error.</p>
<pre><code>test(<span>"it should fail if string as parameter"</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
expect(sum(<span>"Hello"</span>, <span>"World"</span>))
.toEqual(<span>Error</span>(<span>"Expecting number type as parameter"</span>));
</code></pre><p>Now that our test cases has been written, we only need to make sure that our sum function pass all the test cases. Let create a file called sum.js in the root folder, the file will contain a function that accept two number and sum the two numbers</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> sum = <span>(<span>a, b</span>) =&gt;</span> {
<span>if</span> (<span>typeof</span> a !== <span>"number"</span> || <span>typeof</span> b !== <span>"number"</span>)
<span>return</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>"Expecting number type as parameter"</span>);
<span>return</span> a + b;
};
<span>module</span>.exports = { sum };
</code></pre><p><strong>NB:</strong> the above snippet first check the data type of the parameter if it is not number it should return an error with the message Expecting number type as parameter
What next now is to run our test, before then we need to configure our project to work with jest, let go directly to package.json file and add "test": "jest" to the script section. our script should look something related to the below code.</p>
<pre><code><span>"scripts"</span>: {
 <span>"test"</span>: <span>"jest"</span>
},
</code></pre><p>we can now run our test with npm test or yarn test command, below is the result/output of our test</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1565358199378/1bhgVjCSX.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="1_PsM3efGAtxmSC7Pt0CatSw.png"></p>
<p>Okay, let me show one of test cases i wrote for login, there are many ways of test cases, all you need to do is to think about what you want to check for.</p>
<pre><code>describe(<span>"Login Module for test cases"</span>, () =&gt; {
it(<span>"should return the user if the name is valid"</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span>done</span>) </span>{
request(app)
.post(<span>"/login"</span>)
.send({ username: <span>"DAMMAK"</span>, password: <span>"Adedamola"</span> })
.end(<span><span>function</span>(<span>err, res</span>) </span>{
expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(<span>200</span>);
expect(res.text).toEqual(
<span>JSON</span>.stringify({ username: <span>"DAMMAK"</span>, password: <span>"Adedamola"</span> })
);
done();
});
});
it(<span>"fails if login details is wrong"</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span>done</span>) </span>{
request(app)
.post(<span>"/login"</span>)
.send({ username: <span>"wrongUser"</span>, password: <span>"wrongPass"</span> })
.end(<span><span>function</span>(<span>err, res</span>) </span>{
expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(<span>400</span>);
done();
});
});
it(<span>"fails if empty request data was sent"</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span>done</span>) </span>{
request(app)
.post(<span>"/login"</span>)
.send({})
.end(<span><span>function</span>(<span>err, res</span>) </span>{
expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(<span>400</span>);
done();
});
});
});

<p>I haven't said anything about Big Sur yet, and since the public beta has  been out for a while, and I'm getting more questions about it, it's time.</p>

<p>At present, it's <strong>not possible</strong> to make bootable copies of Big Sur, even with <code>asr</code>, Apple's own built-in replication utility. As such, we haven't released a Beta, or even an internal Alpha, because it wouldn't meet our own requirements.</p>

<p>So, for the moment, we're holding back, hoping that Apple will fix the issues and allow 3rd party (or even 1st party, given <code>asr</code>) bootable backups. While <code>asr</code> was failing completely in previous builds, in the most recent one it isn't able to back up because the system volume isn't properly 'sealed' (which is ominous, since why wouldn't a standard install be sealed, and if it's not, why wouldn't you be able to back it up anyway).</p>

<p>So, while progress is being made, we're kind of stuck waiting for the king.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my advice for macOS Betas remains as valid as ever: <strong>do not install a macOS Beta</strong> unless you have a <strong>critical business need</strong> to do so. These Betas, even when public, are not for general use, and certainly not for anyone who wants a reliable system for day-to-day work.</p>

<p>If you <strong>must</strong> install it, use Time Machine for backups for now (and, given my advice in <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/practices_make_perfect_backups/">Practices Make Perfect (Backups)</a>, on a continuing basis in addition to other methods), since it's  at a relatively equivalent Beta quality level to the OS itself and is explicitly tested and supported by Apple.</p>

<p>I'll be back when we have additional news to share. For those in the US, enjoy Labor Day weekend!</p>

September 5, 2020 | https://rillabs.com/posts/crystal-concurrency-with-easier-syntax-than-go | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rillabs.com/posts/crystal-concurrency-with-easier-syntax-than-go">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been playing around a lot with concurrency in Go over the years, resulting in libraries such as <a href="https://scipipe.org/" target="_blank">SciPipe</a>, <a href="http://flowbase.org/" target="_blank">FlowBase</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rdfio/rdf2smw/" target="_blank">rdf2smw</a>. My main motivation for looking into Go has been the possibility to use it as a more performant, scaleable and type-safe alternative to Python for data heavy scripting tasks in bioinformatics and other fields I've been dabbling in. Especially as it makes it so easy to write concurrent and parallel code in it. Be warned that this context is surely giving me some biases.</p>

<p>I find the concurrency features of Go - with its lightweight goroutines and channels - to be hard to beat in that it also provides true parallelism by mapping the goroutines onto physical operating system threads automatically in the background. Few if any other mainstream languages does that. It lifts off a lot of concerns that you as a developer don't need to deal with.</p>

<p>Still, the Go syntax has always felt rather complex. After 5+ years, I have still not learned how to open up a file and reading from it line by line, and need to check up the syntax on a site like <a href="https://gobyexample.com/" target="_blank">gobyexample.com</a>. This task also requires importing two different libraries (os, and bufio), which you have to remember.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://rillabs.com/site/assets/files/1111/selection_161.120x0-is.png" width="120">With this background, I found it interesting when a new language on the block, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2019/09/06/parallelism-in-crystal.html">touts to provide the same concurrency features</a>, still in a language with static typing and ahead-of-time compiling, with a much more scriptlike and clean syntax.</p>

<p>In this post, I take a brief look at Crystal by implementing a pattern I have been using a lot in Go: A simple pipeline, where one go-routine does something like read from a file, feeding of the data to another goroutine over a channel to do more work. I this post I will do this by implementing an extremely simple pipeline that does just that, in both of the languages, and then do some observations about the differences between the languages. In more concrete terms, what the program does is: let one go-routine read from a file line by line, and another one calculate the frequency of G and C:s over all of A, T, G, Cs in a DNA-file in the FASTA format.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-67/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa.gz">the (68MB) file I'm using here</a>.</p>

<p>You can find both of the below code files <a href="https://github.com/samuell/experiments/tree/master/govscr" target="_blank">on GitHub here</a>.</p>

<h3>Go implementation</h3>

<p>Here is the Go implementation:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"

<h3>Crystal implementation</h3>

<p>... and here is the same functionality, implemented in Crystal:</p>

<pre><code>lines_chan = Channel(String).new(16)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the input file in a separate fiber (and thread, if you set the
# CRYSTAL_WORKERS count to something larger than 1), and send its output on a
# channel
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
spawn do
  gcfile = File.new("Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa")                                      
  gcfile.each_line() do |line|                                                                            
    lines_chan.send(line)                                                                                 
  end                                                                                                     
  gcfile.close 
ensure  
  lines_chan.close
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the lines on the channel in the main thread, and count GC fraction.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at = 0
gc = 0
while line = lines_chan.receive?
  if line.starts_with?('&gt;')
    next
  end
  line.each_byte() do |chr|
    case chr
    when 'A', 'T'
      at += 1
      next
    when 'G', 'C'
      gc += 1
      next
    end
  end
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output results
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gcfrac = gc / (gc + at)
puts "GC fraction: #{gcfrac}"
</code></pre>



<p>Note that to run the Crystal program with true multi-threading, you have to send a flag: -Dpreview_mt, to use it.</p>

<p>Compile and run with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>CRYSTAL_WORKERS=4; crystal build --release -Dpreview_mt -o gccr gc.cr
./gccr

</code></pre>

<h3>Some differences</h3>

<p>We can note a few differences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Crystal code is considerably shorter.</li>
	<li>I find the Crystal code easier to read.</li>
	<li>Crystal does not need to create a main()-function, but can include code directly in the file, similar to Python and Ruby.</li>
	<li>In Crystal you don't need to import multiple packages to open a file, and to loop over it.</li>
	<li>In Crystal, as seen in the code, we use "<a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/exception_handling.html#ensure" target="_blank">ensure</a>", between any two "begin/end" clauses, in a similar way as Go:s "defer", to ensure something is done as the very last thing before existing the function.</li>
	<li>In my tests, the Go implementation has always outperformed the Crystal one, so far. This might change with time of course.</li>
	<li>Truly static binary deployments seem to not be fully supported in Crystal just yet (see <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">Issue #9285</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think it is a bit early to draw to hard conclusions between the two langauges, as Crystal is so new, and this is just a very first test by me. But I find it interesting to have two languages with a similar set of concurrency primitives, to be able to compare various factors, as well as approaches taken.</p>

<p>Crystal looks like a promising alternative to Go, for concurrency use cases which allows writing in a much more script-like syntax. This could potentially make it a really interesting language for scientific fields such as bioinformatics, something that bioinformatics luminary <a href="https://twitter.com/lh3lh3" target="_blank">Heng Li</a> <a href="https://lh3.github.io/2020/05/17/fast-high-level-programming-languages" target="_blank">has been blogging about</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">pointed out a problematic area for deployment</a>, currently).</p>

<p>I'm still worried about whether Crystal will manage to provide the same level of extremely portable, statically linked binaries though (EDIT: <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2020/02/02/alpine-based-docker-images.html" target="_blank">there's a workaround, using alpine linux</a>), and this might turn out to be a real dealbreaker. Also, with the upcoming generics implementation in Go, some of the complexities of Go might be possible to hide away for end-users of some libraries, by providing high-level abstractions over typical complex tasks. One can of course also wonder if Crystal will be able to reach the level of popularity and size of ecosystem as Go, without a large industry backer (maybe if they can leverage the large number of Ruby-developers looking for a new compiled, fast language?).</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what happens, as Crystal gets closer to 1.0, and Go soon gets generics into the language. What can be said for sure, is that we will soon have more options, for writing concurrent, performant code.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

      <p>Long-time readers will know that I’m <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/05/18/rss-nothing-better/">a big fan of RSS feeds</a>. An RSS reader has been essential to my web experience since I first came online, and I’ve doggedly stuck to using them even as the web has centralised onto a few platforms and much digital ink spilt about the “death of RSS”. Luckily, I’m not the only one who prefers this old-school, human-curated approach to the web over today’s platforms and their algorithms.</p>
<p><a href="https://fraidyc.at/">Fraidycat</a> is a browser extension for following people on the web, created by someone named Kicks Condor, whose <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/">main internet presence</a> as of this writing appears to an elaborate act of performance art. Previously it was a blog, and maybe it will be one again, who can say?</p>
<p>Like a latter day <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/09/23/review-whys-poignant-guide-to-ruby/">_why</a>, Kicks combines clever programming with a colourful and quirky aesthetic to create software that is both useful and a little odd, hence the name and colourscheme.</p>

<p>Fraidycat differs from traditional RSS readers (ala the late Google Reader) in two key ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. It’s not just an RSS reader</strong>. In addition to RSS (and Atom, and JSON) feeds, you can use Fraidycat to follow Twitter and Instagram accounts, Youtube channels, TiddlyWikis, <a href="https://davidyat.es/2019/06/24/indieweb/">indieweb</a> h-feeds and <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat#follow-support">a whole bunch more</a>. The explicit goal of the project is provide a universal interface for following people regardless of the platforms they use.</p>
<p>Although I don’t share the author’s complete aversion to using social media sites, I find Fraidycat very useful for following a few high signal-to-noise accounts on various platforms, so I can make sure I see everything they post.</p>
<p><strong>2. It doesn’t look like an email client.</strong> Most feed readers carefully track and even save each post from each of your subscriptions. Posts are marked as read or unread, and, where possible, the full body text of each post is embedded in the reader’s interface. Fraidycat doesn’t even try to do either of these things. No distinction is made between read and unread items (beyond your browser’s visited/unvisited link colouration), and no tally is kept. No interface exists for reading post content. Every site/account you subscribe to is shown with links to its ten most recent posts. Clicking a link takes you to the post in question, and if you want to see the eleventh most recent post, well, you can go to the site itself.</p>
<p>These feature omissions are my favourite things about Fraidycat. I follow a lot of different sites for a lot of different reasons. With some, I want to read every post. With others, I just want to see the latest headlines and dip into when one catches my eye. Every RSS reader I’ve used in the past has irritated me by running up unread counts for the latter category.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my post about <a href="https://davidyat.es/2020/03/14/reader-modes/">browser reader modes</a>, I usually prefer to read articles on their original websites – partly so that they don’t all blend together like Medium sludge, and partly because syndicated content has an uncomfortably high probability of losing formatting and even chunks of text. So Fraidycat’s philosophy of linking rather than rendering is ideal for my usecase. The world could probably do with more developers who <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/wiki/Rejected-Features">intentionally leave out features</a>.</p>
<p>Fraidycat allows you to categorise your subscriptions on two levels: category and importance. Categories are up to you to define, and are shown as tabs at the top of the page. One subscription can appear in multiple categories. Kicks’s preferred aesthetic is to use emojis as category names, but you can use words too.</p>
<p>Importance is unique to Fraidycat, and provides a way for you to prioritise content and shape your reading habits. Each subscription can appear in one of the below importances:</p>

  <img src="https://davidyat.es/content/images/2020/09/fc-importance.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
    
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This allows you to determine how often you’ll want to check in on a given site/account/person, which is likely to be a function of how frequently they post, the lengths of their posts, and how interested you are in their content. A favourite Twitter account, for example, may be placed in Real-time, while a rarely updated blog, or one you seldom have time to read, may be placed in Sometimes, to be glanced at when you’re not doing anything else.</p>
<p>I wasn’t completely sold on this feature when I first started using Fraidycat, as I’d often forget to check the last two tabs, but that’s basically the point of having them – not everything needs to be checked for updates all the time. In any case, you can just put everything in Real-time or Frequent and never bother with time sensitivity if it doesn’t work for you.</p>
<p>Before switching to Fraidycat about a year ago, I used web-based RSS readers like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>. My main concern with switching was that my subscriptions would be tied to my main PC. Fortunately, the extension integrates with browser sync, so subscriptions will be synced between devices. This functionality didn’t exist the last time I tried using a browser extension feed reader, and its absence would have been a dealbreaker (and also a heartbreaker).</p>
<p>There’s currently no way to get Fraidycat on a smartphone, but I don’t need it there. Even the feeds I follow in real-time aren’t quite important enough that I need to check them when I’m not in front of a computer. Which, I think, is very much in keeping with the application’s philosophy. Fraidycat produces no notifications, applies no machine learning to your subscriptions to recommend content you might like, and doesn’t gamify your actions or track you. You choose who to follow and how to follow, and the app does nothing outside of that. Fraidycat is the best RSS reader I’ve ever used because of what it leaves out.</p>

<p>Permutation City is a great novel with a very interesting philosophical argument embedded inside it. Many people don’t want to read the whole novel, so here is my short explanation of Egan’s Dust Theory.</p>



<p>If you think experience is simulatable, you buy computational or “patternist” theories of identity, there are some very strange implications that are not commonly brought up. </p>



<p>Because computation is sort of subjective, just a set of relations that can be usefully interpreted as representing a function, this seems to imply that the function you identify with can be interpreted as being simulated by any sufficiently complex set of relations. </p>



<p>That is, for any random set of relations with enough complexity to represent a human mind, Egan claims, there exists an exotic encoding scheme that can interpret this set of relations as representing any arbitrary function, including the function that you would call “I”.</p>



<p>Now you cannot access this information usefully, so most functions can be said to not usefully exist within this randomness. But if you buy the whole “I think therefore I am” business this does not matter for those functions that are conscious, because consciousness is self-justifying. </p>



<p>So the function that is you is being “run” far more often in random noise than engineered computers or ‘real’ physical reality. This is sort of like the Boltzmann brain idea but even worse because it applies to any set of relations. According to Egan’s argument all possible experiences that can be computed by any sufficiently complex set of relations are in fact computed by them. </p>



<p>In fact, even if you imagine a static set of relations that do not evolve in time there still exists encoding schemes that can interpret this set of relations as any arbitrary function, so in some sense the set of mathematical objects that represent “you” and “me” and all possible minds can be said to exist in these timeless relations. </p>



<p>Egan discusses some counterarguments to the idea here: <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html">https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html</a></p>

September 5, 2020 | https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>



<pre>MOV rm&lt;-&gt;r     4  3

INC/DEC rw    16  2
INT ib         1  2
INTO           1  4
INT 3          1  3</pre>



<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>



<pre>INC/DEC rm        3
PUSH rm           4
NOT rm            3
NEG rm            3
CALL FAR rm       8
CALL rm           8
TEST rm,i         4
JMP rm            2
JMP FAR rm        4
IMUL/MUL rmb      8
IMUL/MUL rmw      8
IDIV/DIV rmb      8
IDIV/DIV rmw      8</pre>



<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

  <h2>Abstract</h2><p>
  We present a new flow-based video completion algorithm. Previous flow completion methods are often unable to retain the sharpness of motion boundaries. Our method first extracts and completes motion edges, and then uses them to guide piecewise-smooth flow completion with sharp edges. Existing methods propagate colors among local flow connections between adjacent frames. However, not all missing regions in a video can be reached in this way because the motion boundaries form impenetrable barriers. Our method alleviates this problem by introducing non-local flow connections to temporally distant frames, enabling propagating video content over motion boundaries. We validate our approach on the DAVIS dataset. Both visual and quantitative results show that our method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p>Like everyone else, I got excited about the latest Ubuntu LTS release, 20.04, and installed it on day one. A month in, I’m sorry to say that I leave disappointed. The amount of unready <em>snap</em> features being effectively forced onto Ubuntu is affecting my usability and user-friendliness.</p>

<p>In 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu’s Software Center was switched from being a .deb version of GNOME Software to a <em>snap</em> app. The new snapped store can handle management of <em>snap</em> applications and traditional .deb ones, but it can’t install or remove Flatpak applications, like the .deb version could.</p>



<p>Users wanting to install Flatpak apps <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/25/how-to-install-flatpak-apps-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts/">need to revert to using the .deb version</a>. It’s not an ideal solution when previous Ubuntu Software releases could handle all three formats. In all, the latest Ubuntu Software is a step back.</p>



<h2><strong>Browsing the Snap Store sucks</strong></h2>



<p>Good apps, and finding them, are central to the success of any modern operating system. Even without Flatpak apps, I was expecting the snapped store to at least do what it’s supposed to do well–help find apps. It turns out that instead Ubuntu prioritizes snap apps over .deb ones in store search results at any cost! So you’ll see a long list of non relevant entries of snap apps above .deb ones, even if your search term exactly matches the latter. -_-</p>



<p>Needless to say this is a serious issue for discovering software, especially for users switching from Windows or Mac. The snapped store isn’t just a step back, but is downright unreliable.</p>



<h2><strong>Slow and forced Chromium snap</strong></h2>



<p>On the latest Ubuntu, if you try to download the .deb version of Chromium using either the Software Store or the command line, it acts as an alias and installs the snap version! Essentially, Chromium snap is shoved down your throat even if you explicitly asked for the .deb version. This is not cool Ubuntu; Just because Chromium may be easier to maintain as a snap app doesn’t justify this forced behavior.</p>



<p>Besides, a typical user doesn’t care how the app is managed in the backend, all they care about is how it works. And that’s another place where snaps don’t shine. They are slow. I hate that Chromium’s snap takes more than 10 seconds to load on cold boot on a freaking SSD, whereas .deb and Flatpak apps load in 1-2 seconds. Snaps are simply not fast enough to be default <em>anything</em> yet.</p>



<h2><strong>No control over updates</strong></h2>



<p>Snap applications auto-update and that’s fine if Ubuntu wants to keep systems secure. But it can’t even be turned off manually. Auto-updating of snaps can only be deferred at best, until at some point, like Windows, it auto-updates anyway. Even on metered connections, snaps auto-update after a threshold time. This is unacceptable. Even Apple has easy options to disable automatic software updates.</p>



<p>Ubuntu’s update process with 20.04 LTS is a deal breaker for people on limited bandwidth connections or who want to know exactly what they’re updating and when they’d like to. Even at best, this behavior is causing me issues like slowing down my connection abruptly and using a major chunk of my limited data for the day. My <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/25?u=uncertainquark">discussion on the Ubuntu forums</a> on the topic and many such raised issues by others didn’t go well, read the <em>full thread</em> if interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Ubuntu was my first Linux-based operating system and is what attracted me to the ecosystem. I have a soft spot for it, especially the amazing Unity days. As such, it is disappointing to see this snap obsession that has taken over Ubuntu. An OS once lauded for its sane defaults and user friendliness is actively going against the user’s will.</p>



<p>What’s especially concerning is that this is the Ubuntu version that millions of people will use for at least two years. I don’t hate snaps but being forced to use it especially when in a clearly premature state is forcing me to hate it. Snaps simply aren’t ready for system-wide daily usage and Ubuntu should’ve known better. Perhaps Ubuntu should’ve created a separate snap-based OS image, like Fedora’s <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/">Silverblue</a>, and only swap the default when it’s ready.</p>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS’ snap obsession has snapped me off of it. I have switched to macOS as my daily driver, for many other reasons. I don’t have the time to keep fixing things on Linux Desktop and be constantly finding ways to work around standard OS features that should otherwise just be available and work.</p>



<p>For those on Linux, I recommend using <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS 20.04</a> instead of Ubuntu as it is basically Ubuntu but without the snap, and some unique features. <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> is what I use on my now secondary device, mainly because of its <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/">app ecosystem</a>, <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/03/21/why-i-love-elementary-os-file-manager/">excellent file manager</a> and the <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/04/my-contributions-to-elementary-os-and-how-you-can-too/">welcoming nature</a> of their developers for contributions and suggestions.</p>

  <div>
    <p>For the past few months, I’ve been running a handful of SSH Honeypots on some
cloud providers, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a>,
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b2cffefc9c81">DigitalOcean</a>, and
<a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&amp;u=2497236&amp;m=46483&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">NameCheap</a>.
As opposed to more complicated honeypots looking at attacker behavior, I decided
to do something simple and was only interested in where they were coming from,
what tools might be in use, and what credentials they are attempting to use to
authenticate.  My dataset includes 929,554 attempted logins over a period of a
little more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a big surprise, I’ll go ahead and let you down easy: my
analysis hasn’t located any new botnets or clusters of attackers.  But it’s been
a fascinating project nonetheless.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="honeypot-design">Honeypot Design</h2>

<p>With a mere 200ish lines of Go, I implemented a honeypot server using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh?tab=doc"><code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code></a>
library as the underlying implementation.  I advertised a portable OpenSSH
version as the server version string (sent to clients on connection).  I then
logged each connection to a SQLite database, including the timestamp, IP
address, client version, and credentials used to (attempt to) authenticate.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-credentials">Analysis of Credentials</h2>

<p>In a surprise to absolutely nobody, <code>root</code> is by far the most commonly tried
username for login sessions.  I suspect there must be many attackers trying
lists of passwords with just <code>root</code> as the username, as 78% of attempted logins
were with username <code>root</code>.  None of the remainder of the top 10 are particularly
surprising, although <code>usuario</code> was not one I expected to see.  (It is Spanish
for <code>user</code>.)</p>

<p>Blank passwords are the most common attempted passwords, followed by other
obvious choices, like <code>123456</code> and <code>password</code>.  Just off the top 10 list was a
surprising choice of password: <code>J5cmmu=Kyf0-br8CsW</code>.  Interestingly, a Google
search for this password only finds other people with experience running
credential honeypots.  It doesn’t appear in any of the password wordlists I
have, including <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a> and
others.  If anyone knows what this is a password for, I’d love to know.</p>

<p>There were a number of other interesting passwords such as <code>7ujMko0admin</code>, used
for a bunch of networked DVRs, and also known to be used by malware attacking
IoT devices.  There are other passwords that don’t look obvious to a US-centric
view of the world, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>baikal</code> – a lake in Siberia</li>
  <li><code>prueba</code> – Spanish for test</li>
  <li><code>caonima</code> – a Mandarin profanity written in Pinyin</li>
  <li><code>meiyoumima</code> – Mandarin for “no password”</li>
  <li><code>woaini</code> – Mandarin for “I love you”</li>
  <li><code>poiuyt</code> – <strike>The name for an optical illusion also known as the "devil's tuning
fork"</strike> <strong>Edit:</strong> multiple redditors pointed out this is the begginning
of the top row of the keyboard from right to left.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also dozens and dozens of keyboard walks, like <code>1q2w3e</code>, <code>1qaz@WSX</code>,
and <code>!QAZ2wsx</code>.  There are many more that took me much longer to realize they
were keyboard walks, such as <code>4rfv$RFV</code> and <code>qpwoei</code>.</p>

<p>It has actually fascinated me to look at some of the less obvious passwords and
discern their background.  Many are inexplicable, but I assume they are from
hardcoded passwords in devices or something along those lines.  Or perhaps
someone let their cat walk across the keyboard to generate it.  I’ve certainly
had that experience.</p>

<p>Overall, the top 10 usernames and top 10 passwords (not necessarily together)
are:</p>

<p>Again, no real surprises here.  <code>ubnt</code> is a little bit higher than I would have
thought (for Ubiquiti networking gear) but I suppose there’s a fair bit of their
gear on the internet.  It’s interesting to see the mix of “lazy admin” and
“default credentials” here.  It’s <em>mildly</em> interesting to me that all substrings
of the first 10 digits (3 or longer) are included, <em>except</em> for 7 digits.  I
guess 7 digit passwords are less common?</p>

<h2 id="timing-information">Timing Information</h2>

<p>Though I imagine these kind of untargeted scans are long-term processes
continually running, I decided to check and see what the timing looked like
anyway.  Neither the day of week analysis nor the hour of day analysis look
like there’s any significant variance.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/days_of_week.png" alt="Day of Week">
<img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/hours.png" alt="Hour of Day"></p>

<p>Looking at the number of login requests over the time period where I’ve been
running the honeypots shows the traffic to be intermittent.  While I didn’t
expect the number to be constant, the variance is much higher than I expected.
I imagine a larger sample size and more nodes would probably make the results
more even.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/dates.png" alt="Day of Study"></p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-sources">Analysis of Sources</h2>

<p>So where are all of these requests coming from?  I want to start by noting that
<em>none</em> of my analysis is an attempt to attribute the actors making the requests
– that’s just not possible with this kind of data.  There’s two ways to look at
the source of requests – in terms of the network, and in terms of the (assumed)
geography.  My analysis relied on the IP to ASN and IP to Country data provided
by <a href="https://iptoasn.com/">iptoasn.com</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the country-level data, networks from China lead the pack by a long
shot (62% of all login attempts), followed by the US.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/countries.png" alt="Countries"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Country</th>
      <th>Count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>CN</td>
      <td>577789</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>US</td>
      <td>87589</td>
    </tr>

      <td>TW</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LT</td>
      <td>6623</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Again, I’m not claiming that these countries mean anything other than location
of the autonomous system (AS) that originates the requests.  I also did not do
individual IP geolocation, so the results should be taken with a small grain of
salt.</p>

<p>So what networks are sourcing this traffic?  I have the <a href="https://systemoverlord.com/static/attachments/gopot/asns.csv">full AS counts and
data</a>, but the top networks are:</p>

<p>Chinanet is no surprise given the high ratio of China in general.  OVH is a
low-cost host known to have liberal AUP, so is popular for both malicious and
research purposes.  DigitalOcean and Microsoft, of course, are popular cloud
providers.  Surprisingly, AWS only sourced about 600 connections, unless they
have a large number of IPs on a non-Amazon ASN.</p>

<p>Overall, traffic came from 27,448 unique IPv4 addresses.  Of those, more than 11
thousand sent only a single request.  At the other end of the spectrum, the top
IP source sent 64,969 login requests.</p>

<p>Most hosts sent relatively few requests, the large numbers are outliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/ipcnts.png" alt="IP Count Graph"></p>

<p>Surely, by now a thought has crossed your mind: how many of these requests are
coming from Tor?  Surely the Tor network is a wretched hive of scum and villany,
and the source of much malicious traffic, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/tor.png" alt="Tor Graph"></p>

<p>Not at all.  Only 219 of the unique source IPs were identified as Tor exit
nodes, representing only 0.8% of the sources.  On a per-request basis, even a
smaller percentage of requests is seen from Tor exit nodes.</p>

<h2 id="client-software">Client Software</h2>

<p>Remember – this is self-reported by the client application, and just like I can
spoof the server version string, so can clients.  But I still thought it would
be interesting to take a brief look at those.</p>

<p>You know, I didn’t expect that.  <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> as the top
client strings.  (Also not sure what to make of the case difference.)  I wonder
if people are building the PuTTY SSH library into a tool for scanning or
wrapping the binary in some kind of script.</p>

<p>Go, paramiko, and libssh are less surprising, as they’re libraries designed for
integration.  It’s hard to know if the OpenSSH requests are linked into a
scanning tool or just wrapped versions of the SSH client.  At some point in the
future, I might dive more into this and trying to figure out which software uses
which libraries (at least for the publicly-known tools).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I was hoping to find something earth-shattering in this research.  Instead, I
found things that were much as expected – common usernames and passwords,
widespread scanning, large numbers of requests.  One thing’s for sure though:
connect it to the internet and someone’s going to pwn it.</p>

    <p>The programming world is moving towards functional programming (FP). More developers are using languages with an explicit bias towards FP, such as Scala and Haskell, while object-oriented (OO) languages and their communities adopt FP features and practices. (A striking example of the latter is the rise of Typescript and React in the Javascript community.) So what is FP and what does it mean to write code in a functional style? It’s common to view functional programming as a collection of language features, such as first class functions, or to define it as a programming style using immutable data and pure functions. (Pure functions always return the same output given the same input.) This was my view when I started down the FP route, but I now believe the true goals of FP are enabling local reasoning and composition. Language features and programming style are in service of these goals. In this post I attempt to explain the meaning and value of local reasoning and composition.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-is">What Functional Programming Is</h2>
<p>I believe that functional programming is a hypothesis about software quality: that software that can be understood before it is run and is built of small reusable components is easier to write and maintain. The first property is known as local reasoning, and the second as composition. Let’s address each in turn.</p>
<p>Local reasoning means we can understand pieces of code in isolation. When we see the expression <code>1 + 1</code> we know what it means regardless of the weather, the database, or the current status of our Kubernetes cluster. None of these external events can change it. This is a trivial and slightly silly example, but it illustrates a point. A goal of functional programming is to extend this ability across our code base.</p>
<p>It can help to understand local reasoning by looking at what it is not. Shared mutable state is out because relying on shared state means that other code can change what our code does without our knowledge. It means no global mutable configuration, as found in many web frameworks and graphics libraries for example, as any random code can change that configuration. Metaprogramming has to be carefully controlled. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>, for example, as again it allows other code to change our code in non-obvious ways. As we can see, adapting code to enable local reasoning can mean quite some sweeping changes. However if we work in a language that embraces functional programming this style of programming is the default.</p>
<p>Composition means building big things out of smaller things. Numbers are compositional. We can take any number and add one, giving us a new number. Lego is also compositional. We compose Lego by sticking it together. In the particular sense we’re using composition we also require the original elements we combine don’t change in any way when they are composed. When we create by <code>2</code> by adding <code>1</code> and <code>1</code> we get a new result but we don’t change what <code>1</code> means.</p>
<p>We can find compositional ways to model common programming tasks once we start looking for them. React components are one example familiar to many front-end developers: a component can consist of many components. HTTP routes can be modelled in a compositional way. A route is a function from an HTTP request to a handler function or a value indicating the route did not match. We can combine routes as a logical or: try this route or, if it doesn’t match, try this other route. Processing pipelines are another example that often use sequential composition: perform this pipeline stage and then this other pipeline stage.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Types are not strictly part of functional programming but statically typed FP is the most popular form of FP and sufficiently important to warrant a mention. Types help compilers generate efficient code but types in FP are as much for the programmer as they are the compiler. Types express properties of programs, and the type checker automatically ensures that these properties hold. They can tell us, for example, what a function accepts and what it returns, or that a value is optional. We can also use types to express our beliefs about a program and the type checker will tell us if those beliefs are incorrect. For example, we can use types to tell the compiler we do not expect an error at a particular point in our code and the type checker will let us know if have made an incorrect assumption. In this way types are another tool for reasoning about code.</p>
<p>Type systems push programs towards particular designs, as to work effectively with the type checker requires designing code in a way the type checker can understand. As modern type systems come to other languages they naturally tend to shift programmers in those languages towards a FP style of coding.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-isn%E2%80%99t">What Functional Programming Isn’t</h2>
<p>In my view functional programming is not about immutability, or keeping to “the substitution model of evaluation”, and so on. These are tools in service of the goals of enabling local reasoning and composition, but they are not the goals themselves. Code that is immutable always allows local reasoning, for example, but it is not necessary to avoid mutation to still have local reasoning. Here is an example of summing a collection of numbers. First we have the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>numbers<span>:</span> Array<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>:</span> number <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    numbers<span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> total<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same function in Scala:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> sum<span>(</span>numbers<span>:</span> List<span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>var</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span></span><br><span>  numbers<span>.</span>foreach<span>(</span>x <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span></span><br><span>  total</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In both implementations we mutate <code>total</code>. This is ok though! We cannot tell from the outside that this is done, and therefore all users of <code>sum</code> can still use local reasoning. Inside <code>sum</code> we have to be careful when we reason about <code>total</code> but this block of code is small enough that it shouldn’t cause any problems.</p>
<p>In this case we can reason about our code despite the mutation, but neither the Typescript nor the Scala compiler can determine that this is ok. Both languages allow mutation but it’s up to us to use it appropriately. A more expressive type system, perhaps with features like Rust’s, would be able to tell that <code>sum</code> doesn’t allow mutation to be observed by other parts of the system<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Another approach, which is the one taken by Haskell, is to disallow all mutation and thus guarantee it cannot cause problems.</p>
<p>Mutation also interferes with composition. For example, if a value relies on internal state then composing it may produce unexpected results. Consider generators in Javascript. They maintain internal state that is used to generate the next value. If we have two generators we might want to combine them into one generator that yields values from the two inputs. Here’s the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span>type Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> Generator<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span> never<span>&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> index <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>yield</span> index<span>++</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> zip<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>left<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> right<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>b<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span><span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>zipIt</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> l <span>=</span> left<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> r <span>=</span> right<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>l<span>.</span>done <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>r<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>const</span> result<span>:</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>l<span>.</span>value<span>,</span> r<span>.</span>value<span>]</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>            <span>yield</span> result<span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> <span>zipIt</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This works if we pass two distinct generators to <code>zip</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>However if we pass the same generator twice we get a surprising result.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> inf <span>=</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span>inf<span>,</span> inf<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>The usual functional programming solution is to avoid mutable state but we can envisage other possibilities. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">effect tracking system</a> would allow us to avoid combining two generators that use the same memory region. These systems are still research projects, however.</p>
<p>So in my opinion immutability (and purity, referential transparency, and no doubt more fancy words that I have forgotten) have become associated with functional programming because they guarantee local reasoning and composition, and until recently we didn’t have the language tools to automatically distinguish safe uses of mutation from those that cause problems. Restricting ourselves to immutability is the easiest way to ensure the desirable properties of functional programming, but as languages evolve this might come to be regarded as a historical artifact.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>I have described local reasoning and composition but have not discussed their benefits. Why are they are desirable? The answer is that they make efficient use of knowledge. Let me expand on this.</p>
<p>We care about local reasoning because it allows our ability to understand code to scale with the size of the code base. We can understand module A and module B in isolation, and our understanding does not change when we bring them together in the same program. By definition if both A and B allow local reasoning there is no way that B (or any other code) can change our understanding of A, and vice versa. If we don’t have local reasoning every new line of code can force us to revisit the rest of the code base to understand what has changed. This means it becomes exponentially harder to understand code as it grows in size as the number of interactions (and hence possible behaviours) grows exponentially. We can say that local reasoning is compositional. Our understanding of module A calling module B is just our understanding of A, our understanding of B, and whatever calls A makes to B.</p>
<p>We introduced numbers and Lego as examples of composition. They have an interesting property in common: the operations that we can use to combine them (for example, addition, subtraction, and so on for numbers; for Lego the operation is “sticking bricks together”) give us back the same kind of thing. A number multiplied by a number is a number. Two bits of Lego stuck together is still Lego. This property is called closure: when you combine things you end up with the same kind of thing. Closure means you can apply the combining operations (sometimes called combinators) an arbitrary number of times. No matter how many times you add one to a number you still …</p></div></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered what <code>python</code> does when you run one of your programs?</p>



<p>This article opens a series which seeks to answer this very question. We'll dive into the internals of CPython, Python's most popular implementation. By doing so we'll understand the language itself at a deeper level. That is the primary goal of this series. If you're familiar with Python and comfortable reading C but have no much experience working with CPython's source code, there is a good chance you'll find this writing interesting.</p>
<h3>What CPython is and why anyone would want to study it</h3>
<p>Let's begin by stating some well-known facts. CPython is a Python interpreter written in C. It's one of the Python implementations, alongside with PyPy, Jython, IronPython and many others. CPython is distinguished in that it is original, most-maintained and the most popular one.</p>
<p>CPython implements Python, but what is Python? One may simply answer – Python is a programming language. The answer becomes much more nuanced when the same question is put properly: what defines what Python is? Python, unlike languages like C, doesn't have a formal specification. The thing that comes closest to it is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/index.html">Python Language Reference</a> which starts with the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical analysis. This should make the document more understandable to the average reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, you might have to guess things and in fact you would probably end up implementing quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the language are, you should definitely be able to find them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Python is not defined by its language reference only. It would be also wrong to say that Python is defined by its reference implementation, CPython, since there are some implementation details that are not a part of the language. A garbage collector that relies on a reference counting is one example. Since there is no single source of truth, we may say that Python is defined partly by the Python Language Reference and partly by its main implementation, CPython.</p>
<p>Such a reasoning may seem pedantic, but I think it is crucial to clarify the key role of the subject we're going to study. You might still wonder, though, why we should study it. Besides plain curiosity, I see the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a full picture gives a deeper understanding of the language. It's much more easier to grasp some peculiarity of Python if you're aware of its implementation details.</li>
<li>Implementation details matter in practice. How objects are stored, how the garbage collector works and how multiple threads are coordinated are subjects of high importance when one wants to understand the of applicability of the language and its limitations, estimate performance or detect inefficiencies.</li>
<li>CPython provides Python/C API which allows to extend Python with C and embed Python inside C. To use this API effectively a programmer needs a good understanding of how CPython works.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What it takes to understand how CPython works</h3>
<p>CPython was designed to be easy to maintain. A newcomer can certainly expect to be able to read the source code and understand what it does. However, it may take some time. By writing this series I hope to help you to shorten it. </p>
<h3>How this series is laid out</h3>
<p>I chose to take a top-down approach. In this part we'll explore the core concepts of the CPython virtual machine (VM). Next, we'll see how CPython compiles a program into something that the VM can execute. After that, we'll get familiar with the source code and step through the execution of a program studying main parts of the interpreter on the way. Eventually, we'll be able to pick out different aspects of the language one by one and see how they're implemented. This is by no way a strict plan but my approximate idea.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>An execution of a Python program roughly consists of three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialization</li>
<li>Compilation</li>
<li>Interpretation</li>
</ol>
<p>During initialization stage, CPython initializes data structures required to run Python. It also prepares such things as builtin types, configures and loads builtin modules, sets up the import system and does many other things. This is very important stage that is often overlooked by the CPython's explorers because of its service nature.</p>
<p>Next comes the compilation stage. CPython is an interpreter, not a compiler in a sense that it doesn't produce machine code. Interpreters, however, usually translate source code into some intermediate representation before executing it. So does CPython. This translation phase does the same things a typical compiler does: parses a source code and builds an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), generates bytecode from an AST and even performs some bytecode optimizations.</p>
<p>Before looking at the next stage, we need to understand what bytecode is. Bytecode is a series of instructions. Each instruction consists of two bytes: one for an opcode and one for an argument. Consider an example:</p>



<p>CPython translates the body of the function <code>g</code> to the following sequence of bytes: <code>[124, 0, 100, 1, 23, 0, 83, 0]</code>. If we run a standard <code>dis</code> module to disassemble it, here's what we'll get:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>2</span>           <span>0</span> <span>LOAD_FAST</span>            <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
            <span>2</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>           <span>1</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
            <span>4</span> <span>BINARY_ADD</span>
            <span>6</span> <span>RETURN_VALUE</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>LOAD_FAST</code> opcode corresponds to a byte <code>124</code> and has an argument <code>0</code>. <code>LOAD_CONST</code> opcode corresponds to a byte <code>100</code> and has an argument <code>1</code>. <code>BINARY_ADD</code> and <code>RETURN_VALUE</code> instructions are always encoded as <code>(23, 0)</code> and <code>(83, 0)</code> respectively since they don't need an argument.</p>
<p>At the heart of CPython is a virtual machine that executes bytecode. By looking at the previous example you might guess how it works. CPython's VM is stack-based. It means that it executes instructions using the stack to store and retrieve data. <code>LOAD_FAST</code> instruction pushes local variable on the stack. <code>LOAD_CONST</code> pushes a constant. <code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two objects from the stack, adds them up and pushes the result back. Finally, <code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops whatever is on the stack and returns the result to its caller.</p>
<p>The bytecode execution happens in a giant evaluation loop that runs while there are instructions to execute. It stops to yield a value or if an error occured.</p>
<p>Such a brief overview gives rise to a lot of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do the arguments to the opcodes <code>LOAD_FAST</code> and <code>LOAD_CONST</code> mean? Are they indices? What do they index?</li>
<li>Does the VM places values or references to the objects on the stack?</li>
<li>How does CPython know that <code>x</code> is a local variable?</li>
<li>What if an argument is too big to fit into a single byte?</li>
<li>Is instruction for adding up two numbers the same as for concatenating two strings? If yes, then how does the VM differentiate between these operations?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to answer these and other intriguing questions we need to look at the core concepts of the CPython VM.</p>
<h3>Code objects, function objects, frames</h3>
<h4>code object</h4>
<p>We saw what bytecode of a simple function looks like. But a typical Python program is more complicated. How does the VM execute a module that contains function definitions and make function calls?</p>
<p>Consider a program:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>What does its bytecode look like? To answer this question, let's analyze what the program does. It defines a function <code>f</code>, calls function <code>f</code> with <code>1</code> as an argument and prints the result of the call. Whatever the function <code>f</code> does, it's not a part of the module's bytecode. We can assure ourselves by running a disassembler.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>1</span>           <span>0</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>               <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span><span>code</span> <span>object</span> <span>f</span> <span>at</span> <span>0</span><span>x10bffd1e0</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span> <span>"example.py"</span><span>,</span> <span>line</span> <span>1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span>
            <span>2</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>               <span>1</span> <span>(</span><span>'f'</span><span>)</span>
            <span>4</span> <span>MAKE_FUNCTION</span>            <span>0</span>
            <span>6</span> <span>STORE_NAME</span>               <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>4</span>           <span>8</span> <span>LOAD_NAME</span>                <span>1</span> <span>(</span><span>print</span><span>)</span>
           <span>10</span> <span>LOAD_NAME</span>                <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
           <span>12</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>               <span>2</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
           <span>14</span> <span>CALL_FUNCTION</span>            <span>1</span>
           <span>16</span> <span>CALL_FUNCTION</span>            <span>1</span>
           <span>18</span> <span>POP_TOP</span>
           <span>20</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>               <span>3</span> <span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
           <span>22</span> <span>RETURN_VALUE</span>
</pre></div>


<p>On line one we define function <code>f</code> by making a function from something called code object and binding name <code>f</code> to it. We don't see the bytecode of the function <code>f</code> that returns an incremented argument.</p>
<p>The pieces of code that are executed as a single unit like a module or a function body are called code blocks. CPython stores information about what a code block does in a structure called code object. It contains the bytecode and such things as lists of names of variables used within the block. To run a module or to call a function means to start evaluating a corresponding code object.</p>
<h4>function object</h4>
<p>A function, however, is not merely a code object. It must include additional information such as name, docstring, default arguments and values of variables defined in the enclosing scope. This information, together with a code object, is stored inside a function object. <code>MAKE_FUNCTION</code> instruction is used to create it. The definition of the function object structure in the CPython source code is preceeded by the following comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Function objects and code objects should not be confused with each other:</p>
<p>Function objects are created by the execution of the 'def' statement. They reference a code object in their __code__ attribute, which is a purely syntactic object, i.e. nothing more than a compiled version of some source code lines.  There is one code object per source code "fragment", but each code object can be referenced by zero or many function objects depending only on how many times the 'def' …</p></blockquote></div></div>

          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.

          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

        <p>
          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.

        <p>
          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

Without setting any servers, we can do a lot of things like <a href="https://www.ravsam.in/blog/collect-form-responses-using-google-apps-script/">collecting form responses</a>, email marketing campaigns, etc. But as a developer, we like our code to be on Version Control System like Github. In this blog, we will discuss how can you setup Github Actions to automatically backup your Google Apps Scripts to Github.</p><h3 id="contents">Contents</h3><ol><li><a href="#1-installing-clasp">Installing Clasp</a></li><li><a href="#2-creating-a-new-repository">Creating a new Repository</a></li><li><a href="#3-adding-important-files">Adding Important Files</a></li><li><a href="#4-setting-up-github-actions">Setting up Github Actions</a></li><li><a href="#5-adding-github-actions-secrets">Adding Github Actions Secrets</a></li><li><a href="#results">Results</a></li></ol><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>Before getting started, we assume that you have set up the following:</p><ul><li>A Google Apps Script Project</li><li>A Github Account</li></ul><h2 id="1-installing-clasp">1. Installing Clasp</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/google/clasp">Clasp</a> is a Google tool to develop Apps Script projects locally. It is short for <strong>Command-Line Apps Script Projects</strong>. Setting up Clasp is simple. Follow this <a href="https://github.com/google/clasp#readme">amazing guide</a> by Google to get your login credentials, which we will be using later while setting up Github Actions.</p><p>Once you have successfully logged in, use the following command to get the content of the credentials file.</p><h2 id="2-creating-a-new-repository">2. Creating a new Repository</h2><p>Depending upon your requirement, create a new public/private repository at <a href="https://repo.new/">Github</a>. Once you have created a new repository, add a .gitignore file with the following content:</p><p>This prevents our credential file to be committed back to the repository.</p><h2 id="3-adding-important-files">3. Adding important files</h2><p>Now it’s time to add some new files to the repository.</p><p>a.) <strong>setup.sh</strong></p><p>This script will prevent us from logging in again by using our already logged in credentials from Github Actions secrets, which we will be setting up later.

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

            <h2>Mastodon bad. Pleroma good.</h2>
            <p>If you’ve been following me on the fediverse, you would’ve witnessed my
numerous (failed) attempts at migrating from Mastodon to Pleroma,
running on my Raspberry Pi. I finally got it working, and these are the
steps I took. It’s sort of a loose guide you could follow, but I can’t
promise it’ll work for you.</p>

<p>The Erlang and Elixir packages are pretty broken and outdated on
Raspbian. So this time, I built them from source.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> I also assume
you have Mastodon and Pleroma (source, not OTP) installed—probably at
<code>/home/mastodon/live</code> and <code>/opt/pleroma</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>Once you have Erlang and Elixir compiled and sitting in your <code>PATH</code>,
pull <a href="https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/migrator">soapbox-pub/migrator</a>.
Now read the readme and the <code>do_migration.sh</code> script to get an idea of
what you’re getting into.</p>

<p>Move into the cloned directory and create a <code>.env</code>:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>MASTODON_PATH</span><span>=</span>/home/mastodon/live
<span>PLEROMA_PATH</span><span>=</span>/opt/pleroma
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, run:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> yarn   <span># install deps</span>
<span>$</span> cp -r mastodon/* /home/mastodon/live
<span>$</span> cp -r pleroma/* /opt/pleroma
<span>$</span> <span>RAILS_ENV</span><span>=</span>production yarn masto <span>export</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you run into any permissions issues, <code>chown</code> and proceed. This should
export all your Mastodon activity into <code>/home/mastodon/live/migrator</code>.
Now, copy the <code>migrator</code> directory into your Pleroma installation path.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> cp -r migrator /opt/pleroma
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can then import all of it into Pleroma (possibly prefixed with <code>sudo
-Hu pleroma</code>):</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> <span>MIX_ENV</span><span>=</span>prod mix migrator.import
</code></pre></div>

<p>If all went well, you would’ve successfully migrated from Mastodon to
Pleroma. If not, well feel free to send me an email (or @ me on the fedi).
I suppose you could also reach <a href="https://alexgleason.me/">Alex</a>—he’s
the incredibly based guy who wrote the migrator,
<a href="https://soapbox.pub/">soapbox-fe</a> and does some Elixir magic he keeps
<a href="https://gleasonator.com/@alex">posting about</a>.</p>

<p>Rest assured, the migrator has a 100% success rate—Alex and I are
apparently the only two who have it working. 2/2.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-migrate">why should you migrate?</h2>

<p>Because Pleroma is cleaner, leaner<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> and prettier looking<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. Oh, and we
have chats.

It was disclosed in August that the national AI strategy presented by the authority had been <span><a href="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/2020/08/12/saudi-national-ai-strategy-approved/">approved by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud</a></span>. PWC has forecast that AI could contribute $135 billion (or 12.4%) to Saudi Arabia’s GDP by the year 2030.</p>
<p>Established by royal decree in August 2019, the SDAIA was given the mandate to drive the national data and AI agenda for transforming the country into a leading data-driven economy, and has developed Saudi Arabia’s national AI strategy over the past year. Although the details of the plan have been kept under wraps, the new strategy is expected to contribute to 66 of the country’s strategic goals, which are directly or indirectly related to data and AI.</p>
<p>The SDAIA has already reached a number of milestones since its inception, establishing three specialised centres of expertise: the National Information Center, the National Data Management Office and the National Center for AI. It has also begun building one of the largest data clouds in the region by merging 83 data centres owned by over 40 Saudi government bodies. More than 80 percent of government datasets have so far been consolidated under a national data bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the authority has been using AI to identify opportunities for improving the Kingdom’s government processes, which may result in some $10 billion in government savings and additional revenues.</p>
<p>Originally slated for March 2020, the Global AI Summit will discuss AI, its applications, impact on social and economic development, plus global challenges and opportunities. The event aims to connect key decision makers from government and public sector, academia, industry and enterprise, tech firms, investors, entrepreneurs and startups.</p>
<p>October’s virtual summit will be organised into four tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Shaping the new normal;</li>
<li>AI and governments;</li>
<li>Governing AI; and</li>
<li>The future of AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Global AI Summit aims to tackle the challenges faced by countries around the world, from technical to ethical. Details of the agenda and speaker platform for the Global AI Summit have yet to be announced, although the presentation of the Saudi national artificial intelligence strategy is bound to be a highlight.</p>

Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

<p>The PixLab development team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of the <strong><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">PixLab API 1.9.72</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pixlab.io/images/pix.png" alt="PixLab Logo"></p>
<p>Since its launch on 2017, PixLab have already processed over 450 Millions of users contents whether static images, GIF or Videos Frames.
<strong>This milestone release introduces new <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">API endpoints</a>, various minor bug fixes, processing speed improvements by up to 5% and many innovative features</strong>.
Let's start with the one we are existed about in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">Passports &amp; ID Cards Scan</a>: While documents scanning were introduced in earlier version of the PixLab API via the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> endpoint. This release pushes further the accuracy of the OCR engine. <strong>A 5MB raw Passport sample now takes less than 3 seconds to execute</strong> including face detection &amp; extraction, MRZ (<em>Machine Readable Zone</em>) extraction and finally transformation of the Raw MRZ data into textual content. You can try out the accuracy of the <strong>Passport scanning engine</strong> using these <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/symisc/3a8df5c54e427ec1781515ceb27965e4">Python</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/symisc/ca211ac7ff38ddcaab102e98fe5a7fa9">PHP</a></strong> scripts to see it in action.</li>
<li>DNS infrastructure moved to <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> for faster than ever response times.</li>
<li>Full support for <strong>HTTP/2</strong> and <strong>HTTP/3 (QUIC)</strong>.</li>
<li>Up to <strong>three layers of redundancy</strong> for the standard <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=ocr">PixLab OCR engine</a> for faster, accurate &amp; guaranteed scan results.</li>
<li>A fresh update of the <strong>adult &amp; gore content detection ML model</strong> which is used to power the famous PixLab /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=nsfw">NSFW</a> API endpoint that have already analyzed over 100 millions of user contents with high accuracy.</li>
<li><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facedetect">Face Detection</a> (including <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facelandmarks">facial landmarks</a> extraction) &amp; <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facemotion">Emotion Pattern</a> (including gender &amp; age) extraction are now using the RetinaFace Model which scores the highest on the LFW dataset.</li>
<li>The /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint now fully support scanning ID cards from <a href="https://blog.pixlab.io/2019/11/docscan-api-endpoint-support-id-cards-passports">Malaysia &amp; Singapore</a> and many other countries (at users request) as well the brand new <strong>India Aadhar ID card</strong>. Find out more information about <strong>Aadhard fully support</strong> via our blog announcement <a href="https://blog.pixlab.io/2020/03/full-scan-support-for-india-aadhar-id-card">here</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, a brand new, high performance custom image processing layer written in C/C++ and powered by <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> and our <a href="https://sod.pixlab.io/">Embedded computer Vision Library SOD</a> is integrated directly into our cloud API.</li>
</ul>
