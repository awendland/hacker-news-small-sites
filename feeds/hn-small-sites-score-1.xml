<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/v0.9.png" alt="v0.9"></p><p><a href="https://www.tremor.rs/">Tremor</a> is an open source event processing and data distribution engine designed to interpose or intercept data in complex systems primarily to inject quality of service, correct data flows and to enrich or support complex traffic shaping, routing and load-balancing based on contextual, situational or content derived dynamic conditions.</p><p>Tremor has a powerful ETL language designed for flexibly pattern matching structured data such as JSON efficiently ( SIMD-accelerated ), and an easy to configure declarative flow-based SQL language designed for rich JSON like data to describe data processing and data flow graphs with declarative QoS constraints.</p><p>Tremor has been in large scale global production at Wayfair now for 2 years and is gaining adoption in other organizations.</p><p>In this release; we return to tremor’s roots and focus on quality of service by adding linked-transports to interpose RPC-like and synchronous-blocking protocols; we add circuit breakers to manage upstream and downstream byzantine events; and we provide mechanisms that offer shades of delivery guarantees or intrinsic transactions that when combined with suitable upstream or downstream systems can produce lossless data transfers for certain routes, whilst remaining best effort for routes that do not support lossless delivery or recovery in and of themselves with minimal loss.</p><p>Last, but most importantly - this is the first release of tremor as a Linux Foundation / CNCF early stage sandbox project. We would like to thank everyone
at Wayfair in Boston and Berlin, the Linux Foundation and the CNCF who facilitated, helped, nurtured, transitioned DNS entries and worked with the legals to make this transition to fully open governance happen. A huge thanks to Chris and Amye at the Linux Foundation.</p><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2><p>Read on for details after these headings</p><ul><li>Refactored Concurrency Model</li><li>Unified Command Line Interface</li><li>Linked Transports</li><li>Circuit Breakers &amp; ‘Guaranteed’ Delivery</li><li>Behavioural Changes</li></ul><p>Stop here, unless you like details.</p><h2 id="refactored-concurrency-model">Refactored Concurrency Model</h2><p>The maturity of concurrency and synchronization primitives within the rust programming language has transformed massively over the past 18 months. As these primitives have now stabilised, and libraries based on these primitives are now stabilising we have migrated the tremor runtime model to be fully internally asynchronous, non-blocking and task-driven where possible.</p><p>There are still code paths within tremor; such as in kafka adapters that integrate with native libraries where a configurable number of threads can be configured and spun up - but we no longer have a thread per pipeline model.</p><p>This means tremor application designers can now configure, deploy and run 1000’s or pipelines in the same instance of tremor. In concert with the modularity theme in tremor v0.8 the quality of life/service theme of v0.9 further expands the flexibility available to tremor application designers and operators to design very high performance and highly efficient data processing and distribution solutions based on tremor.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/08_09_comparison.png" alt="08_09_comparison"></p><p><em>Feel the awesome power of asynchronous runtimes</em></p><h2 id="unified-command-line-interface">Unified Command Line Interface</h2><p>Tremor has matured to the point that we have outgrown the legacy developer and operator tooling. In this release we have unified, enhanced and extended developer and operator tooling to boldly go into a much improved quality of life for tremor users.</p><p>The new <a href="https://docs.tremor.rs/operations/cli/">unified command line tool</a> <code>tremor</code> can generate auto-completion for your shell ( anything from zsh to powershell ), generate documentation for your modules, run tremor, debug the language intermediate forms, and has benchmark, integration, command-driven and unit testing frameworks built in.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/cli1.gif" alt="cli1">
<img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/cli2.gif" alt="cli2"></p><p>Everything is syntax highlighted and should conform to whichever theme you have running in your terminal. It’s like a swiss army knife - but more reliable because its German but cool, because it’s a Berliner ( in the JFK, not cake sense … )</p><h2 id="linked-transports">Linked Transports</h2><p><a href="https://docs.tremor.rs/operations/linked-transports/">Linked Transports</a> allow bidirectional event flows in a request/response style to be built and routed through a tremor pipeline. This enables Tremor users to introspect, route, or even directly reply to incoming messages and intercept and manipulate outgoing responses. Tremor can thus be used as proxy, load-balancer or API-Gateway before or in between existing REST APIs or websocket servers.</p><p>Users can now support and host their own domain specific REST APIs that can interact with the wider ecosystem of systems interconnected with tremor - roll your own control plane and consolidate to a single pane of control - without deploying a separate solution or service.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/linked-transports.png" alt="linked-transports"></p><p>(note: replies can only be delivered to feet in 0.9, we’re trying to extend that to other limbs in later releases)</p><h2 id="circuit-breakers--guaranteed-delivery">Circuit breakers &amp; “Guaranteed” delivery</h2><p>The signal and contraflow control events within Tremor have been built upon in v0.9 to provide an event acknowledgement mechanism - this in turn provides the foundation for <a href="https://docs.tremor.rs/operations/gdcb/">guaranteed delivery and circuit breakers</a>, which enables finer grained declarative quality of service mechanisms within tremor.</p><p>We can now configure tremor applications or algorithms to <code>pick up where they left off</code> even if the tremor processes are killed and restarted. Under certain conditions ( based on configuration ) we can recover entire end to end flows - such as the lossless distribution of messages across kafka sources and sinks regardless of which participant dies and restarts.</p><p>Of course, if you choose UDP we cannot guarantee lossless delivery but tremor even on a horrible quality network should still minimise loss and recover gracefully - it just won’t do so without message loss unless there’s some application level handling of recovery.</p><p>Fully lossless transactional delivery is 10% the throughput of regular data distribution. It’s as slow as Apache Kafka for now - but we will put effort into tuning performance here if the use case arises.</p><p>Circuit breakers enable us to detect downstream system failures beyond backpressure and make informed decisions to either discard, reroute or stop dataflow. This allows a more ingrained control over behaviour in non-optimal conditions compared to “always drop” earlier tremor versions implemented.</p><p>Delivery guarantees, describes a set of functionality that improves the delivery guarantees of a tremor system. What guarantees can be given depends heavily on the upstream and downstream systems and the protocols used to communicate with them.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/cb-gd.gif" alt="cb-gd"></p><p>Tremor’s proposal to to adjoin the CNCF as an early stage standbox project was accepted by the CNCF TOC and formal onboarding into the CNCF began and completed on time in September. This means that the tremor project’s copyright is now held by the Linux Foundation on behalf of the maintainers.</p><p>In practice what does this mean? Day to day there is no impact - currently all maintainers of the tremor project are sponsored by Wayfair. But the project now also has the support of the Linux Foundation and the CNCF and this in turn makes it easier for external organizations to adopt and contribute to in support of their own business needs and open source governance strategies.</p><p>Tremor is visible on the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/">CNCF Sandbox Project page</a> and via the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF Landscape</a>. The tremor project can now access development services form the CNCF and LF ranging from artwork and website design through to visibility, marketing and promotion of the project at LF, CNCF and other conferences and events.</p><h2 id="behavioral-changes">Behavioral Changes</h2><ul><li><p><strong>REST offramp/sink:</strong></p><ul><li>In an effort to streamline the REST sink no longer adds newlines for batched events, this can now be done by using the “lines” postprocessor.</li><li><code>put</code> as an option is no longer supported instead method is now used.</li><li>Only supports one <code>endpoint</code> instead of multiple. The round robin operator with multiple offramps can be used as a much more capable replacement.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Heredocs:</strong></p><ul><li>Leading indentation is no longer stripped.</li><li>Heredocs now perform string interpolation allowing it to be used for templating of textual content. In result { and } need to be escaped.</li></ul></li><li><p>The <strong>tremor-server</strong>, <strong>tremor-query</strong>, <strong>tremor-script</strong>, and <strong>tremor-tool</strong> binaries are now all unified in the self-name <strong>tremor</strong> binary. The binary also replaces the legacy benchmark and integration testing frameworks, the 3rd party coyote command test harness and introduces a new unit testing facility for tremor-script. It’s one command to rule them all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Circuit breakers</strong> are enabled and active by default - this is a significant behavioral change in sinks/offramps that completely disconnect - this will now stop the message flow on sources/onramps. Care should be taken in a production environment with non-resilient, non-robust and non-redundant downstream connectivity as this is now an operational concern that can benefit from a much finer grained configuration surface.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>generic::backpressure</strong> operator has been renamed to <strong>qos::backpressure</strong>, for this release using the old name will emit a warning in this release but this backwards compatibility consideration will be addressed and the old name removed in the next release.</p></li><li><p>The operators <strong>runtime::tremor</strong>, <strong>grouper::bucket</strong> and <strong>script</strong> inside of <strong>trickle</strong> have their <strong>error</strong> output renamed to <strong>err</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Linked transports</strong> introduce a source nature to sinks and a sink nature to sources. This feature is in preview mode and how to configure it is very likely to change as usability issues or misconceptions are ironed out. ( v0.10 )</p></li></ul><p>On the CNCF Slack: <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/tremor">https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/tremor</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Posted October 18th, 2020</p>
<p>I like bash, and I somehow find that surprising.
Bash is dangerous, bash is old, bash is <em>simple</em>.
Other people - people I respect - like bash too.</p>
<h2>Why not?</h2>
<p>Across all of the awful things that bash does wrong - that make bash a bad programming language - my biggest complaint
is the general idea that bash is unsafe.
It is unclear when - if at all - types are meaningful in bash.
Code is highly imperative.
Error-handling is almost non-existant.
Global state 😱.
This all normally spells doom.</p>
<h2>Aside: why so?</h2>
<p>I often think of programming languages on the imperative &lt;-&gt; functional axis.
I like the languages on the right, and dislike the ones on the left.</p>
<p>The obvious counter is that sometimes you need something quick and dirty, something that doesn't need to compile,
something that doesn't need expensive virtual machine spin-up.</p>
<p>We are sort of left then with bash, perl, php, python, and ruby for quick and dirty.
And, to be fair, I could imagine using <code>irb</code> as a shell environment.
The others: I could not.</p>
<p>Bash has something else going for it: it's <em>ubiquitous</em>.</p>
<p>Supposing for a moment that ubiquity is a sufficient argument to justify learning <em>some</em> bash, I imagine I haven't
convinced you: people seem to settle on a primary language, a scripting language, and some basic bash.</p>
<p>I'm here to tell you that you should just use bash as your scripting language, and any time you need "real" scripting
capabilities, you really just needed your primary language, and if your primary language seemed too clunky, that's a
problem in itself.</p>
<p>I will die on this hill: python is garbage.
Just use bash.</p>
<h2>Something something monads</h2>
<p>Bash has something more going for it.</p>
<p>When we write scripting languages like python, we normally utilise imperative state, and some nice higher level
constructs like list comprehensions, to transform some data.</p>
<p>I'll argue then that python's primary interface is the <em>collection</em>.
Python code is often all about manipulating collections.</p>
<p>Thinking about primary languages, I'll mention a couple.</p>
<p>Rust - my primary language - has a familiar ruby- or java-like syntax (a lot of methods) that many are familiar with.
But - in terms of thinking about writing code and decomposing problems, Rust's biggest win is its powerful enums and
traits.</p>
<p>So I'll argue that rust's primary interface is the <em>trait</em>, which when wielded, categorises the world and declaratively
describes the world's capabilities.</p>
<p>Java has baggage (DI, code-generation, gradle, annotation-hell), but its claim to fame is the Object.</p>
<p>Java's primary interface is in mapping the relationship between different kinds of data, and things that manipulate
data.</p>
<p>Bash has a primary interface too!</p>
<h2>I/O</h2>
<p>Bash's primary interface - and the thing that makes bash powerful, productive, and admired by all - is the fact that
everything is built around I/O.</p>
<p>In that sense, bash is hardly even a real language.
Bash just leverages subprocesses, and gives you fine control over where to wire up signals.</p>
<p>That's what makes bash elegant, but it's also what makes bash incredibly powerful, not only for composing systems, but
for decomposing software architecture into its critical signals.</p>
<p>One complaint about bash seems to be that everyone writes their own flavor of it.</p>
<p>My flavor is one big <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html">pipeline</a>, with some basic
safety sprinked in.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>I have a small bit of software on a cron-job which scrapes property listings online and writes a summary to a
matrix.org channel.</p>
<p>To write this software I decomposed the problem into pure I/O and only wrote the applications I needed to represent that
problem space as a pipeline (ref: <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrape">1</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/filterfrom">2</a>,
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrapex">3</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/send_glitch">4</a>).</p>
<p>This pattern is a beaut, and one I'd like to repeat more of in the future.</p>
<p>I've heard folks refer to this as "using bash as glue code", but this seems to be taking things one step further.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>My flavor of bash is better than yours, because it elevates my primary language, minimises bash's safety impact, helps

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>When writing JavaScript applications, you describe its dependencies using a <code>package.json</code> file. This file contains all of your applications direct dependencies and their versions.</p>

<p>If you’re building a RESTful API using Express, for, example, your <code>package.json</code> file will probably list <code>express</code> as a dependency.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whenever you ask others to clone and run your application, they need to install its dependencies using <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause them to download the version <code>4.0.0</code> of Express.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock1.png" alt="An image showing that your application points to the Express pacakge, meaning it depends on it."></p>
<center><i>Your application's direct dependency on Express.</i></center>

<p>When installing Express, a package upon which your application depends, you will also download all of the packages upon which Express itself depends. Among the packages upon which Express depends, you can find, for example, <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send"><code>send</code></a>, a package which provides a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918845/what-exactly-does-serving-static-files-mean">static file server</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock2.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which in turn points to the send package."></p>
<center><i>Express depends on `send`, which causes it to be downloaded when installing your application's dependencies.</i></center>

<p>Additionally, when installing Express and, consequently, <code>send</code>, you will have to install the dependencies of <code>send</code>. Because <code>send</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types"><code>mime-types</code></a>, , a utility package to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mime-types</a>, NPM will install also install <code>mime-types</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock3.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which points to the send package, which then points to the mime-types package."></p>
<center><i>The `send` package depends upon `mime-types`.</i></center>

<p>Finally, when installing <code>mime-types</code>, NPM will notice that <code>mime-types</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db"><code>mime-db</code></a>, and will install <code>mime-db</code> too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock4.png" alt="The dependency chain pointing from your application to express, then to send, then to mime-types, and, finally, pointing to mime-db."></p>
<center><i>NPM downloads the `mime-db` package when installing your application's dependencies because it's a dependency of other dependencies.</i></center>

<p>The process of recursively downloads all of your packages’ dependencies and the dependencies of those dependencies is what causes your <code>node_modules</code> folder to get heavy so quickly.</p>

<p>Even though you only listed <code>express</code> as a dependency, if you check your <code>node_modules</code> folder — the folder in which NPM stores dependencies — you will see that there are many more packages there.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>▾ node_modules/

<p>These packages are not only Express’ dependencies, but also the dependencies of <em>all</em> dependencies.</p>

<p>This dependency download process would be beautiful if it weren’t for the fact that <strong><code>npm install</code> doesn’t necessarily install the same dependencies given the same <code>package.json</code> file</strong>.</p>

<p>Running <code>npm install</code> in the afternoon can cause you to get different dependencies when compared to the <code>npm install</code> your colleague ran in the morning, even though none of you changed the version of Express upon which the application depends, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Having different dependencies is a problem because it can cause the application to present inconsistent behaviour across different environments, which is yet another cause for headaches when you’re trying to build reliable software</strong>.</p>





<p>When listing dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file, you can prefix their versions with a <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>. Each of these symbols will tell NPM that it doesn’t necessarily need to download the exact version you specified. Instead, it will try to download a version which is “compatible” or “equivalent” to the one in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, that you prepended <code>^</code> to Express’ version number in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"^4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In that case, if Express’ maintainers release a fix and bump their version number to <code>4.0.1</code>, running <code>npm install</code> would install the <code>4.0.1</code> version, not the <code>4.0.0</code> as you’ve written in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Express’ maintainers release a new feature and bump their version number to <code>4.1.0</code>, the <code>npm install</code> command will download <code>4.1.0</code>, which <em>should</em> be compatible with the <code>4.0.0</code> version you listed in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time, using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> should <em>not</em> cause problems, because, according to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, bumping <code>minor</code> — the middle version number — or <code>patch</code> — the rightmost version number — means that there are no breaking changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock5.png" alt="In a 4.1.2 version, 4 is the major version number, which indicates breaking changes, 1 is the minor version number, which indicates new features, and 2 is the patch version number, which indicates fixes."></p>
<center><i>Bumping the leftmost version number indicates there have been breaking changes. The middle version number indicates a release contains new features. The rightmost number indicates fixes.</i></center>

<p>However, given enough time, all humans make mistakes. They may, for example, bump the <code>minor</code> or <code>patch</code> when there’s a breaking change, causing builds to break like I once did when I incorrectly released breaking changes to <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/862">bumped the wrong version number</a>, causing millions of builds to break around the world.</p>

<p>So does this mean that <em>not</em> using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> causes <code>npm install</code> to <em>always</em> download the same dependency tree? No, it doesn’t 🙃</p>

<p><strong>Even though you may not add <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> in front of your dependencies’ versions, your dependencies may list <em>their</em> dependencies using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>, which can cause <code>npm install</code> to download different versions depending on the time you’ve run it.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve specified Express’ <code>4.0.0</code> version as a dependency, but Express itself listed <code>send</code> as a dependency using <code>^1.0.0</code>, for example, you could end-up downloading the version <code>1.0.1</code> of <code>send</code> in the morning, and version <code>1.0.2</code> in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the <code>send</code> package’s maintainers release breaking changes and incorrectly tag them as <code>1.0.2</code>, your application could break even though you locked <em>your application’s</em> dependencies by avoiding <code>^</code> and <code>~</code>.</p>





<p>The <code>package-lock.json</code> file lists your application’s dependencies and the dependencies of all its dependencies. In other words, it describes which version of every single package you have installed. That’s why it’s so much longer than <code>package.json</code>.
Whenever you use <code>package-lock.json</code> to install dependencies, you will get the exact same packages, it doesn’t matter whether you’re installing them now or in a thousand years when we’ll hopefully not be using keyboards anymore.</p>

<p>To install dependencies based on your <code>package-lock.json</code> file, you should use <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>By using <code>npm ci</code> you will be able to avoid problems which happen when an application works in your machine, but doesn’t work in someone else’s because they ended up downloading different dependencies due to using <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>That’s why, whenever running your builds in a <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day">continuous integration server</a>, you should install dependencies using <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause the CI server’s build to run just like it had run in your machine.</p>

<p><strong>The reason <code>package-lock.json</code> may change automatically when you run <code>npm install</code> is because NPM is updating the <code>package-lock.json</code> file to accurately reflect all the dependencies it has downloaded since it may have gotten more up-to-date versions of some of them.</strong> Once NPM updates the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, others can get those exact same versions by using <code>npm ci</code> if they want.</p>





<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/">evil human-beings will obtain control of other people’s NPM credentials and release new versions of packages by bumping the package’s <code>patch</code> version number, causing millions of dependants to download the malicious piece of code</a>.</p>

<p>It’s enough for a single package in your entire dependency tree to be compromised for you to end-up downloading the malicious code. Sometimes, the compromised package will not even be a direct dependency of your application or even a dependency of one of your application’s dependencies. It may be, for example, a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.</p>

<p>Because <code>npm ci</code> will cause you to download the exact same packages every time, it will be less likely for you to install malicious code given you have taken the necessary security precautions.</p>





<p><em>Most of the time</em>, package maintainers will bump the correct version numbers when releasing features or fixes, and there is no harm in having these features and fixes in. If anything, they may make your application faster or solve a bug you have.</p>

<p>In other words, having <code>npm install</code> makes it easier to get the “best” versions of packages: the ones with more features and fixes.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm ci</code> exist for slightly different purposes. While the former installs the latest possible versions of your dependencies, the latter installs the exact same versions you had when you last used <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>An additional advantage of using <code>npm ci</code> is its quicker execution. The <code>npm ci</code> command runs faster than <code>npm install</code> because it doesn’t need to check what’s the latest compatible version of a package. Instead, it knows exactly which version to fetch thanks to the exhaustive dependency list in <code>package-lock.json</code>. <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable">In some cases, dependency installations can happen twice as fast</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>install</code> doesn’t by default use <code>package-lock.json</code>, is somewhat controversial, though. Some people would advocate that updating dependencies by default is significantly dangerous and that one should be very explicit when doing it.</p>





<p>Personally, I like to use <code>npm install</code> whenever I’m installing dependencies myself, and <code>npm ci</code> in all my scripts.</p>

<p>I use <code>npm install</code> when installing dependencies myself because, in that case, I can vet which versions I get and make sure that I’ll be using the latest versions of packages, which can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don’t want any of my scripts to update dependencies because machines running automated …</p></article></div>

		<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The Ryuk threat actors went from a phishing email to domain wide ransomware in 5 hours. They escalated privileges using Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472), less than 2 hours after the initial phish. They used tools such as Cobalt Strike, AdFind, WMI, and PowerShell to accomplish their objective.</p>
<p>Ryuk has been one of the most proficient ransomware gangs in the past few years, with the FBI claiming <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-ransomware-victims-have-paid-out-140-million-one-version-has-cost-them-the-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$61 million USD</a> having been paid to the group as of February 2020. Earlier in the year, the group grew a little quiet, but that seems to have changed in the past few weeks, with incidents like what occurred at <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uhs-hospitals-hit-by-reported-country-wide-ryuk-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UHS hospitals</a>.</p>
<h3>Case Summary</h3>
<p>In our previous <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryuk case,</a> we saw the threat actors leverage access to an environment via the Bazar Loader malware. This time around, we saw them accomplish their objective faster, but the general tactics and techniques stayed similar between incidents.</p>
<p>Bazar was introduced to the environment again with the delivery via phishing emails. For an in depth breakdown on this loader, see <a href="https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/front-door-into-bazarbackdoor-stealthy-cybercrime-weapon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this analysis</a> by&nbsp; Roman Marshanski &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/VK_Intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitali Kremez</a>. Bazar, once running, was seen again injecting into explorer.exe, svchost.exe, and spawning command shell processes.</p>
<p>From this loader we saw initial mapping of the domain, using built-in windows utilities such as Nltest. However, unlike the last case, the threat actors started at a lower privileged user and rather than proceed slowly or cautiously, they exploited the recently disclosed Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) to reset the machine password of the primary domain controller.</p>
<p>Lateral movement was initiated via SMB file transfers and WMI executions of Cobalt Strike Beacons. The network indicators align similarly to the prior campaign and were noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/kyleehmke/status/1315499593359122432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Ehmke</a> in response to our last post pivoting off the prior report’s intel. From memory analysis, we were also able to conclude the actors were using a trial version of Cobalt Strike with the EICAR string present in the network configuration for the beacon. Both portable executable and DLL beacons were used.</p>
<p>After moving laterally to the secondary domain controller, the threat actor started on more domain discovery via Net and the PowerShell Active Directory module. From there, the threat actors appeared to use the default named pipe privilege escalation module on the server. At this point, the threat actors used RDP to connect from the secondary domain controller, to the first domain controller, using the built in Administrator account.</p>
<p>Once on the main domain controller, another Cobalt Strike beacon was dropped and executed. Then more domain reconnaissance was performed using <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/05/08/adfind-recon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdFind</a>. Once this completed, at the four hour mark, the threat actors were ready for their final objective.</p>
<p>Four hours and 10 minutes in, the threat actors used the pivot from the primary domain controller to RDP into the Backup server. Backup servers were again targeted first for deployment of the ransomware executable, followed by servers and then workstations.The threat actors finished their objective by executing the ransomware on the primary domain controller, and at the 5 hour mark, the attack completed.</p>
<p>While last time we commented on the lead time between the first and second day to aid detection and response activity, this case goes to show that you can’t count on that kind of timescale. You need to be ready to act in less than an hour, to make sure you can effectively disrupt the threat actor.</p>

<h3>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h3>
<h3><a>Initial Access</a></h3>
<p>Access was initiated by a phishing email leading to the Bazar Loader malware executable.</p>
<h3><a>Execution</a></h3>
<p>Bazar relies on user execution of an executable to run. This user was a Domain User and did not have any other permissions.</p>
<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-1472 was used to reset the credentials on one of the domain controllers in the environment. After resetting the password, the threat actors then targeted a different domain controller, potentially due to breaking services by use of their exploit.</p>

<p>On one of the domain controllers we saw use of the Cobalt Strike named pipe escalation.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo 92d8cc45954 &gt;; \\.\pipe\446b3c</pre>
<h3><a>Defense Evasion</a></h3>
<p>On the first domain controller that the treat actors connected to after their initial connection, they dropped a DLL and executed it via rundll32.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C rundll32 C:\Windows\system32\SQL.dll, StartW</pre>
<p>Dropped via RDP and executed via rundll32 on the second domain controller.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll, rundll</pre>
<p>Shortly after, the DLL was called again via regsrv32.</p>
<pre>regsvr32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll</pre>
<p>Then a 2nd DLL was dropped and executed in a similar manner on the 2nd DC.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\\PerfLogs\\socks64.dll, rundll</pre>
<h3><a>Discovery</a></h3>
<p>Ran on the beachhead.</p>

<p>They then ran the following looking for host names, operating systems and last logon dates of all AD systems.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate | Export-CSV C:\Users\AllWindows.csv -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8</pre>
<p>After already completing the above discovery work and having already pivoted to their 2nd domain controller, the threat actors moved on to AdFind for further domain reconnaissance.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\Temp\adf\AdFind.exe
C:\Windows\Temp\adf\adf.bat</pre>
<p>Contents of the script ran the following with AdFind.</p>
<pre>adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)"
adfind.exe -f "objectcategory=computer"
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)"
adfind.exe -sc trustdmp
adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)"
adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp</pre>
<p>The threat actor then ran this command a few times.</p>

<h3><a>Impact</a></h3>
<p>Starting around 4.5 hours after the initial Bazar malware was executed, the Ryuk threat actors acted on their final objectives and initiated RDP connections from the domain controller previously exploited, to the rest of the environment. This time they initiated the ransomware first on the secondary domain controller (their 1st pivot) and transferred the Ryuk executable over the RDP connection.</p>

    <p>Welcome back to DevOps Industry updates! WFH remains a hot topic in big tech and for the first time in 5 years, HashiCorp introduces not one but two new open-source projects: Boundary and Waypoint. Amazon also released their new time-series database called Timestream and most importantly, we finally now have a way to kill Kubernetes pods with a Doom-like interface. It’s all right here in issue #13:</p>

Docker allows us to build, run, pull, push or inspect container images, but for each of these tasks there are other alternative tools, which might just do a better job at it than Docker. So, let’s explore the landscape and (just maybe) uninstall and forget about Docker altogether…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Moving from front-end to backend development raised many questions in my mind. What is backend development, and why do I need to learn it? Will I be able to master it?</p>
<p>Junior developers usually start their career tinkering with front-end libraries, like Vue.JS, for example, before deciding they are moving to something more challenging to grasp, like Node.JS.<br>Front-end developers deal more with visual elements and static code analysis. They handle more with how the site looks to the visitors, and hence their programming language knowledge doesn't necessitate anything other than JavaScript.<br>The idea behind "full-stack development" is to practically connect developers with the whole exchange dynamics between both front- and backends. Front-end is only a presentation layer, and all the dynamic data displayed on it comes from the backend.<br>Full-stack developers are precious experts since they understand every aspect of the system they are building and can solve complex problems that involve multiple variables.<br>Now that we know the eagle-eye perspective full-stack developers have, let's find out what it takes to make a transition from front-end site development into the backend.</p>
<p><em>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine</em>. Being asynchronous and event-driven, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.<br>I know that is a lot to digest but I will break it all that down in smaller pieces, so it becomes easier to understand.<br>Let's see the progression of an advancing front-end developer who decided to take upon Node.JS. I choose to use a demo project since anything other than that might prove overcomplicated and undoubtedly reduce the learning effect from this exercise.</p>
<h2>Why Node.js is a runtime environment?</h2>
<p>Before Node.js, JavaScript could only run in a web browser for tasks like DOM manipulation, handling user events on a webpage or sending requests to a web server. But in 2009, <em>Ryan Dahl</em> released Node.js by combining the event loop, the fastest JavaScript engine V8 and C++.<br>Node is an executable file in virtually any environment. It operates as a standalone application and can work independently of the browser. Anything that takes place on the server can be handled by Node, including tasks such as user requests or database queries.</p>
<h2>Event-driven Node.js</h2>
<p>Node.js allows developers to use event-driven programming architecture for specific tasks.</p>
<pre><code>const writer = require("getWritableStreamSomehow");
writer.write("hello, Node.js \n");
writer.on("finish", () = &gt; {
  console.log("All writes are now complete.");
});
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the <strong>getWritableStreamSomehow</strong> is not a real module or library. It is only used to demonstrate the idea behind event-driven programming in Node.js.<br>The writer module has an "<strong>on</strong>" function is used to handle some event on the writable stream. Once the writer function finishes outputting the "hello …" message, it will fire the "finish" event. The "on" function will listen and wait for it to finish. A callback function is then triggered, and the console prints: "All writes are now complete."</p>
<h2>The asynchronous nature of Node.js</h2>
<p>The asynchronous nature of Node.js manifests in the fact that our written code does not have to wait for long-running tasks to complete. It can continue to run the remainder of our code and run the callback assigned to our long-running task <em>when</em> it completes.</p>
<pre><code>const foo=()=&gt;{
  someLongRunningFunction("some Parameter",()=&gt;{
    // code to run when the task completes.
    console.log("long running function completed");
  });
  // do some other task.
  console.log("some other task completed");
}
foo(); 
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, when the execution reaches the long-running function, the code written below the function will not have to wait for it to complete, but it will run and the message "some other task completed" <em>will</em> print. Some examples of long-running functions include executing a database query, writing or reading a large file from the file system, or making requests to other servers. The message "long-running task completed" <em>will only</em> print when that task is completed. This is the main reason for the performance of Node.js. It can handle other user requests asynchronously without waiting for some long-running I/O task to complete.<br><em>Now that you know the basic idea behind Node.js, let us get started with setting up Node.js for development.</em></p>
<h2>Setting up Node.js for development</h2>
<p>You can download the latest stable version of Node from this <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.3/node-v12.18.3-x64.msi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">link</a> and install it. After installing Node.js, open your terminal (cmd in windows and bash for mac). Type "<strong>node</strong>" and hit "enter". If a welcome message appears with the installed Node version, we are good to go.</p>
<p>Now we need a code editor to write our code. Personally, I prefer <strong><em>Visual Studio</em></strong><strong> Code</strong> for development. It offers smooth performance, a lightweight code editor, and plenty of extensions for increased productivity. Use the link below to download and install the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> or any other IDE of your preference. </p>
<p>In this guide I will be developing a CRUD (stands for Create – Read – Update - Delete) application with Node.js. First, I will start by setting up the files for our project.<br>We'll start with the basics, and then continue along. The end result will be a fully working API, exposing our <strong>todoApp</strong> Application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new folder in the desired directory with any name of your choice. I will choose <strong>todoApp</strong>. </li>
<li>Open VS code and open the todoApp project folder. </li>
<li>Open your terminal and browse to the current working directory </li>
<li>Type "<em>npminit</em>" and hit enter, and it will ask you a series of questions. Preferably answer or skip them by hitting enter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above procedure will create a package.json file in the <em>todoApp</em><em> directory</em>. Create a new folder named "<strong>src</strong>". Within the "<strong>src</strong>" folder, create an app.js file. </p>
<h2>Requiring/Importing modules</h2>
<p>In any framework, we need to import helper libraries and modules. Node.js modules are simple JavaScript files that expose functions, interfaces, or classes to use in our code.<br>In Node.js, importing modules is <em>requir</em><em>ed</em> because it uses the '<strong>require</strong>' function to do so. For reference, <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v13.x/api/modules.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here is a list of all native modules supported by Node.js</a>. </p>
<p>In the <strong>app.js </strong>file, I will be importing the '<strong>fs</strong>’ module, also known as the file system module. This module allows us to perform tasks related to the host computers’ file system. <br>To avoid moving forward and backward, please create a second folder under <strong>todoApp </strong>called 'data'. This is where we will write our data file into later. </p>
<p>Take a look at the code below:</p>
<pre><code>const fs = require("fs"); 
data = { name: "Sveti", age: "31" };
fs.writeFile("./data/data.json", JSON.stringify(data), (err) =&gt; {
if(!err){
    console.log("data written to file successfully");
  } 
});
</code></pre>
<p>The '<strong>require'</strong> function uses the name of a module. It passes as <em>a parameter</em>. '<strong>Require</strong>' practically imports functionality from the library into our source program and allows us to use the methods therein. </p>
<h2>Writing to a file </h2>
<p>In the first line, I defined a constant named '<strong>fs</strong>' and I assigned it the fs module's contents returned by the '<strong>require</strong>' function. Now all the File System module methods are available to me on the fs constant as an object. </p>
<p>Next, I am writing a simple JSON data object to a file named <strong>data.json </strong>to the '<strong>data</strong>' folder we created previously. The <strong>fs.writeFile </strong>function can take the following arguments: </p>
<ol>
<li>Path to file (type <strong><em>String</em></strong>). </li>
<li>Data to be written (type <strong><em>String</em></strong>), please <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback">read follow this documentation</a> for more info. </li>
<li>Options (Mainly filesystem related), optional </li>
<li>The callback will be called when the writing process completes. The callback takes a single argument of type <strong>err </strong>and is also optional. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Please note</em><em>:</em> With Node.js, you should always use asynchronous functions, as you will get the best performance. </p>
<p>If the file exists at the given path, the <strong>fs.writeFile </strong>function will overwrite it. If the file does not exist, a new file with the same name will be created, and write the data passed through the second parameter.<br></p><p>Please note that I am passing the JSON object after stringifying it because it will be written as an 'Object' without it.<br>After writing the data, when the callback executes, it will return an error if occurred or return null. I will handle the error using a simple 'if' statement. To run the above code, type '<strong>node src/app.js</strong>' in the terminal and hit enter.<br>We get the output as “<i>data written to a file successfully.</i>” <em>Yessss</em>! We ran our first Node.js code successfully. Now let’s check the file <em>data.json</em> in the data folder. Just open the data.json file, and take a look!</p>
<h2>Reading from a file</h2>
<pre><code>const fs = require("fs");
fs.readFile("./data/data.json", { encoding: "utf-8" }, (err, data) =&gt; {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(JSON.parse(data));
    return;
  }
  console.log(err);
});</code></pre>
<p>I wrote some data in the data.json file; let's read it now. I will be using the <strong>fs.readFile</strong> method. The <strong>fs.readFile</strong> function takes the following three arguments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Path to file (type <strong>String</strong>)</li>
<li>Options such as encoding; buffer is used by default</li>
<li>Finally, the callback will be called when the reading process completes. The callback takes two arguments: error and data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that I am parsing the data returned to us to convert the previously written stringified data to a JSON object.<br>Let’s run our code. Now I get output on the terminal as the same data is written previously:</p>
<pre><code>{ name: "Sveti", age: "31" }</code></pre>
<h2>Exporting from a file</h2>
<p>Suppose I am building a web API for a <strong>todo app</strong> where the client app sends 'http requests' to perform CRUD operations on their todo's. But I want to validate data sent to my server so that my database or storage doesn't get filled with impractical data. I can create a function that validates inputs from my users.<br>I could create this function in our main <strong>app.js</strong> file, but it is good practice always to shift code to separate files to keep the codebase manageable.<br>I will create a new folder named '<strong>utils</strong>' in my <em>todoApp folder</em> and add a new file called '<strong>validator.js</strong>'.<br>Now let me create a new function …</p></div></div>

		<p>This blog post continues the series which is a guide through the code analyzers available on the market and their possibilities. I’m trying to help you answer the question: <strong>“Which analyzer package should I use and how to configure it to avoid problems related to async/await?"</strong>. In <a href="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/async-analyzers-p1/">the previous episode</a>, I presented the first seven most common code smells related to asynchronous programming. Today, I present the next seven traps from this area. Lucky you, they can be easily avoided with an appropriate analyzer - for every issue, I provide entries for <code>.editorconfig</code> that configure analyzers that can detect it. Links to NuGet packages, as well as a complete list of analyzers’ rules, can be found in the previous article.</p>
<h2 id="async-code-smells">Async Code Smells<a href="#async-code-smells" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>
<h3 id="8-synchronous-waits">8. Synchronous waits<a href="#8-synchronous-waits" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p><code>async/await</code> keywords are viral, which means if you want to await asynchronous expression and you are in the non-asyc method, then you are forced to rewrite the whole call chain to asynchronous. The easier solution seems to be calling <code>Wait</code> or <code>Result</code> on the returned task but it’s just asking for trouble. This solution will cost you two threads for that execution, or even result in a deadlock. This problem is more widely described in <a href="https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios/blob/master/AsyncGuidance.md#avoid-using-taskresult-and-taskwait">
ASP.NET Core Diagnostic Scenarios - Asynchronous Programming</a>. I highly recommend reading this article - you will find there even more asynchronous code smells.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>void DoSomething()
{
    Thread.Sleep(1); // Reported diagnostics: MA0045
    Task.Delay(2).Wait();  // Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD002, MA0045
    var result1 = GetAsync().Result; // Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD002, MA0045, AsyncifyInvocation
    var result2 = GetAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult(); // Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD002, MA0045
    var unAwaitedResult3 = GetAsync();
    var result3 = unAwaitedResult3.Result; // Reported diagnostics:  VSTHRD002, MA0045, AsyncifyVariable
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomething()
{
    await Task.Delay(1);
    await Task.Delay(2);    
    var result1 = await GetAsync();
    var result2 = await GetAsync();
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># VSTHRD002: Avoid problematic synchronous waits
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD002.severity = error

# MA0045: Do not use blocking call (make method async)
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0045.severity = error

# AsyncifyInvocation: Use Task Async
dotnet_diagnostic.AsyncifyInvocation.severity = error

# AsyncifyVariable: Use Task Async
dotnet_diagnostic.AsyncifyVariable.severity = error

</code></pre>
<p><code>Asyncify</code> package has a very simple diagnostic - it only detects usage of <code>Task.Result</code> property. <strong>However, it has a very powerful code fix which can automatically rewrite the whole synchronous call chain to the one that uses <code>async/await</code> keywords:</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p><code>vs-threading</code> has a similar code fix, unfortunately right now it is totally broken <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vs-threading/issues/454">Issue #454</a>.</p>
<h3 id="9-missing-configureawaitbool">9. Missing ConfigureAwait(bool)<a href="#9-missing-configureawaitbool" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>By default, when we await asynchronous operation using the <code>await</code> keyword, the continuation is scheduled using captured SynchronizationContext or TaskScheduler. This comes with additional performance cost and might result in a deadlock, depending on the SynchronizationContext/TaskScheduler provided by the environment - especially in <code>WindowsForms</code>, <code>WPF</code> and old <code>ASP.NET</code> application (yes, ASP.NET Core is not using SynchronizationContext). <code>ConfigureAwait</code> method wraps returned task into <code>ConfiguredTaskAwaitable</code> structure which changes the logic of scheduling the continuation. By calling <code>ConfigureAwait(continueOnCapturedContext: false)</code> we are ensuring that the current context (if provided) is ignored while invoking the continuation. Setting <code>continueOnCapturedContext</code> parameter to <code>true</code> doesn’t make any sense. If you want to go into the details about this subject, I recommend reading <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/">ConfigureAwait FAQ</a> by <code>Stephen Toub</code>.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    await DoSomethingElse(); //Reported diagnostics: ASYNC0004, MA0004, RCS1090, VSTHRD111, CA2007
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    await DoSomethingElse().ConfigureAwait(false);
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># ASYNC0004: Use ConfigureAwait(false) on await expression
dotnet_diagnostic.ASYNC0004.severity = error

# MA0004: Use .ConfigureAwait(false)
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0004.severity = error

# RCS1090: Call 'ConfigureAwait(false)'.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1090.severity = error

# VSTHRD111: Use ConfigureAwait(bool)
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD111.severity = error

# CA2007: Consider calling ConfigureAwait on the awaited task
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2007.severity = error

</code></pre>
<p>All of the above analyzers offer appropriate code fixes. You can easily add “ConfigureAwait(false)` to all await expressions in one go:</p>
<p>

<h3 id="10-returning-null-from-a-task-returning-method">10. Returning null from a Task-returning method<a href="#10-returning-null-from-a-task-returning-method" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>Returning <code>null</code> value from a non-async method that declares <code>Task/Task&lt;&gt;</code> as a returning type results in <code>NullReferenceException</code> if somebody awaits the method invocation. To avoid that, you should always return the result from this kind of method using <code>Task.CompletedTask</code> or <code>Task.FromResult&lt;T&gt;(null)</code> helpers.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>Task DoAsync() 
{
    return null; //Reported diagnostics: MA0022, VSTHRD114
}

Task&lt;object&gt; GetSomethingAsync() 
{
    return null;  //Reported diagnostics: MA0022, VSTHRD114, RCS1210
}

Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; TryGetAsync(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    return httpClient?.GetAsync("/some/endpoint"); //Reported diagnostics: RCS1210
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>Task DoAsync() 
{
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

Task&lt;object&gt; GetSomethingAsync() 
{
    return Task.FromResult&lt;object&gt;(null);
}

Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; TryGetAsync(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    return httpClient?.GetAsync("/some/endpoint") ?? Task.FromResult(default(HttpResponseMessage));
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># MA0022: Return Task.FromResult instead of returning null
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0022.severity = error

# RCS1210: Return Task.FromResult instead of returning null.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1210.severity = error

# VSTHRD114: Avoid returning a null Task
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD114.severity = error
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, none of the analyzers is able to detect all three cases, so we should go with one of two combinations: <code>RCS1210</code> with <code>VSTHRD114</code> or <code>RCS1210</code> with <code>MA0022</code>.</p>
<h3 id="11-asynchronous-method-names-should-end-with-async">11. Asynchronous method names should end with Async<a href="#11-asynchronous-method-names-should-end-with-async" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>I’m not a fan of this rule. It adds unnecessary noise and reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">hungarian notation</a>. In the description of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vs-threading/blob/master/doc/analyzers/VSTHRD200.md">VSTHRD200</a> we can see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>The .NET Guidelines for async methods includes that such methods should have names that include an "Async" suffix.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I wasn’t able to find the original document and there’s nothing about it in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines">Framework Design Guidelines - Naming Guidelines</a>. IMHO, this naming convention only makes sense when a class provides both synchronous and asynchronous versions of a given method - this is the case mostly for APIs that were created before the <code>async/await</code> era. Anyway, if this rule belongs to your coding standard, you can easily spot all the violations with the following diagnostics: <code>VSTHRD200</code>, <code>ASYNC0001</code>, <code>RCS1046</code>.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomething() //Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD200, ASYNC0001, RCS1046
{
    await Task.Yield();
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    await Task.Yield();
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># ASYNC0001: Asynchronous method names should end with Async
dotnet_diagnostic.ASYNC0001.severity = error

# VSTHRD200: Use "Async" suffix for async methods
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD200.severity = error

#RCS1046: Asynchronous method name should end with 'Async'.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1046.severity = error
</code></pre>
<h3 id="12-non-asynchronous-method-names-shouldnt-end-with-async">12. Non asynchronous method names shouldn’t end with Async<a href="#12-non-asynchronous-method-names-shouldnt-end-with-async" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>This rule definitely makes more sense for me than the previous one. Adding <code>Async</code> suffix to the non-asynchronous method might cause confusion. I think this code smell is rather a result of careless refactoring or requirement changes than intended action.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>void DoSomethingAsync() //Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD200, ASYNC0002, CS1047

dotnet_diagnostic.ASYNC0002.severity = error

# RCS1047: Non-asynchronous method name should not end with 'Async'.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1047.severity = error

</code></pre>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that <code>VSTHRD200</code> is tracking both naming deviations, it simply checks if the <code>Async</code> suffix is applied correctly. It might be good if you need both rules, but if you just need to check if the <code>Async</code> suffix is not applied to synchronous methods, then you should rather use <code>ASYNC0002</code> or <code>RCS1047</code>.</p>
<h3 id="13-pass-cancellation-token">13. Pass cancellation token<a href="#13-pass-cancellation-token" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>Forgetting about passing the cancellation token might cost you a lot of trouble. Log running operation without a cancellation token can block the action of stopping the application or can result in thread starvation when there’s a lot of canceled web requests. To avoid such problems, you should always provide and pass a cancellation token to the methods that accept it, even if it’s an optional parameter. <code>Meziantou.Analyzer</code> package implements two diagnostics which can detect missing cancellation token: <code>MA0032</code> is reported always when we skip cancellation token parameter and <code>MA0040</code> is reported only when there’s a cancellation token in current scope that can be used. You can find more details about those analyzers in the article from analyzers author <a href="https://www.meziantou.net/detect-missing-cancellationtoken-using-a-roslyn-analyzer.htm">

<p>❌ Wrong</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1935, a gentleman called Alonzo Church came up with a simple scheme that could compute…just about anything. His scheme was called Lambda Calculus. It was a phenomenal innovation, given that there weren’t even computers for him to test out his ideas. Even cooler is that those very ideas affect us today: anytime you use a function, you owe a hat tip to Mr. Church. </p><p>Lambda Calculus is so cool that many hackers use it as their secret handshake — a “discreet signal” if you will. The most famous, of course, is PG’s Y Combinator. In this essay, we’ll find out what it’s all about, and do things with functions that we’d never have imagined. In the end you’ll have built just about every programming concept: numbers, booleans, you name it…just with functions.</p><p>City dwellers who drive SUVs rarely consider their cars as ferocious machines that traverse rocky deserts and flooded rivers. It’s the same with programmers and functions. Here’s what we <em>think</em> functions do:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> square (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>*</span><span> x x)))</span></code></pre><p>Safe, clean, and useful. We’re so accustomed that it would surprise us to find the myriad of ways we can bend functions to do just about anything. </p><p>Let’s step out into the wilderness a bit. Say you wanted to make a data structure for pairs: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> pair (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>first</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 0</span>
<span>(</span><span>second</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>How would you do it? It’s sensible to use a map or a class or a record to represent a pair. But…you could use functions too.</p><p>Here’s one way we can make a pair:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                   (</span><span>fn</span><span> [selector]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>selector</span><span> a b))))</span></code></pre><p>No maps or classes…it just returns a function! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-pair (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>ex-pair</span>
<span>; =&gt; #object[church_factorial$church_pair...</span></code></pre><p>Now  our <code>ex-pair</code> takes a <code>selector</code> argument. What if we ran ex-pair with this selector:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ex-pair</span><span> (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span></code></pre><p>Well, <code>(ex-pair (fn [a b] a))</code> would expand too: </p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a) a b)</span></code></pre><p>Which would return… <code>a</code>! </p><p>That just gave us the <code>first</code> value of our pair! We can use that to write a <code>church-first</code> function:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-first-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-first (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                    (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-first-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-first</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>And do something similar for second: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-second-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] b))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-second (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-second-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-second</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>We just used functions to represent pairs. Now, since the grammar for Lisp is just a bunch of pairs plopped together, that also means we can represent the grammar of Lisp…with just functions!</p><p>What we just did was analogous to a city dweller driving their SUV…on a snowy day. It gets a <em>lot</em> crazier. </p><p>We said we could represent <em>everything</em>. Let’s go ahead and try it! </p><p>Here’s what can do. Let’s take a function we know and love, and implement it from top-to-bottom in Lambda Calculus.</p><p>Here’s factorial: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> factorial-clj [n]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> n)</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>*</span><span> n (</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> n)))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span></code></pre><p>By the end of this essay, we’ll have built factorial, only with functions.</p><p>To do this, I want to come up front and say I am cheating a little bit. In Church’s Lambda Calculus, there is no <code>def</code>, and all functions take one argument. Here’s all he says: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjA4LTc0M2VkMDgwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05YTI2LTFlMGUyOWFmNDQ0MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>In his rules, you define anonymous functions by popping a little <code>λ</code> in front. What follows is the argument, following by a  <code>.</code> .After the <code>.</code> is the application.</p><p>This is very much akin to a single-argument anonymous function in Clojure: <code>λ x. x</code> =&gt; <code>(fn [x] x)</code></p><p>We could follow those rules, but writing factorial like that is going to get hard to reason about very quickly. Let’s tweak the rules just a little bit. The changes won’t affect the essence of Lambda Calculus but will make it easier for us to think about our code. Here it goes:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjE3LTc5OWMxYjAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05N2U5LWY0ZDIxZGE2YmJkOC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>1<!-- -->)<!-- --> for a single argument function, <code>(fn [x] x)</code> maps pretty well to Church’s encoding. We can go ahead and use it as is.</p><p>2<!-- -->)<!-- --> Since Church’s lambdas only take one argument, For him to express a function with two arguments, he has to write <em>two</em> anonymous functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>λ</span><span> f. λ x. f x)</span></code></pre><p>This would map to:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f] (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>But, nesting our functions like this can get annoying in Clojure <sup>1</sup>. To make life easier for us, we’ll allow for multi-argument functions:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>3<!-- -->)<!-- --> Finally, Church has no concepts of variables outside of what’s provided by a function definition. </p><p>For him to express </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>make-pair</span><span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>He would have to “unwrap” <code>make-pair</code></p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>λ</span><span> a. λ b. λ selector . selector a b)</span>
<span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>To keep our code sane, we’ll allow for <code>def</code>, but with one rule: </p><p><strong>You can use</strong> <strong><code>def</code></strong> <strong>, as long as you can “replace” it with an anonymous function and nothing breaks.</strong> </p><p>For example, imagine if <code>make-pair</code> <em>referenced itself</em>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> make-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> ...)))</span></code></pre><p>This would break because if we replaced <code>(def make-pair …)</code> with an anonymous function, there would be no variable called <code>make-pair</code> anymore! </p><p>That’s it, these are our rules. With that, we’re ready to make factorial! </p><p>The first thing we need is the concept of a number. How can we do that? </p><p>Church thought of a pretty cool idea. What if “numbers”, where higher-order functions with two arguments:  a function <code>f</code>, and a value <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> zero (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v] v))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> one (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>zero</span><span> f v))))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p><strong>We can figure out what number each function represents by “counting” the number of times</strong> <strong><code>f</code></strong> <strong>was composed.</strong> </p><p>For example, 0 would compose <code>f</code> zero times: it would just return <code>v</code>.  1, would compose f once: <code>(f v)</code>. 2 would compose twice: <code>(f (f v))</code>, and so on. </p><p>To help us see these numbers in our REPL, let’s create a quick converter function: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [church-numeral]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> inc </span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Since a church numeral composes <code>f</code> the number of times it is called with <code>v</code> as the first argument, all we need to see what number it is in Clojure, is to provide <code>inc</code> as <code>f</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>v</code>! Now <code>2</code> would do <code>(inc (inc 0))</code> for example, and get us the corresponding Clojure number.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [zero one two])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (0 1 2)</span></code></pre><p>Cool! </p><p>Take a look at how we wrote two: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p>What we did here,  is <em>delegate</em> f’s composition to the numeral before (in this case <code>one</code> ), and then just called <code>f</code> <em>one more time.</em> </p><p>What if we abstracted the <code>one</code> out?</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-inc</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> f v))))) </span></code></pre><p>Voila. Give this function a numeral, and it will return a new numeral that calls <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. We’ve just discovered <code>inc</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> one)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>3</span></code></pre><p>Cool.</p><p>Now that we have this function, we can also write a quick helper to translate Clojure numbers to these numbers:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> int-&gt;church-numeral</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [clojure-int]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> clojure-int)</span>
<span>      zero</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> clojure-int))))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>5</span></code></pre><p>That’ll come in handy for our REPL.</p><p>Next up, we need a way to “decrement” a number. Well, with <code>inc</code> we create a numeral that composes <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. If we can make some kind of function that composes <code>f</code> <em>one less time,</em> then we’d have <code>dec</code>! </p><p>To do that, we’ll need to go on a short diversion.</p><p>Remember our <code>pair</code> data structure? Let’s create a function for it (we’ll use this in just a moment below): <code>shift-and-inc</code>.  All it would do, is take pair of numbers, and “shift” the pair forward by one:</p><p>For example, applying <code>shift-and-inc</code> to <code>(0 1)</code>,  would produce <code>(1 2)</code>. One more time, it would produce <code>(2 3)</code>, and so on. </p><p>Sounds simple enough: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> shift-and-inc (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>church-pair</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)))))</span></code></pre><p>Bam, we take a pair. The second item is shifted over to the first positions and is replaced with its <code>inc</code>ed friend. Let’s try it out:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> [p (</span><span>shift-and-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> one two))]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [(</span><span>church-first</span><span> p) (</span><span>church-second</span><span> p)]))</span>
<span>; =&gt; (2 3)</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we have <code>shift-and-inc</code>, what if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-dec</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-first</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> shift-and-inc</span>
<span>                      (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> zero zero)))))</span></code></pre><p>Remember that our <code>church-numeral</code> would call <code>shift-and-inc</code> N times, representing its numeral value. If we started with a pair <code>(0, 0)</code>, then what would the result b, if we composed <code>shift-and-inc</code> <code>N</code> times?</p><p>Our result would be the pair <code>(N-1, N)</code>. This means that if we take the first part of our pair, we have <code>dec</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-dec</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 9</span></code></pre><p>Nice.</p><p>Next up, multiplication. Say we multiply <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. We’d need to produce a church numeral that composes <code>f</code>, <code>a * b</code> times. To do that, we can leverage the following idea:</p><p>Say we made a function <code>g</code>, which composes <code>f</code> <em>b</em> times. If we fed that function to <code>a</code>, it would call <code>g</code>, <em>a</em> times.  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjI2LTdmOTFmYzAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05MmY2LTVlZDdhNzA0YWE1MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If <code>a</code> was “2” and “b” was 3, how many times would <code>f</code> get composed? Well, <code>g</code> would be composed twice. Each time <code>g</code> is composed, <code>f</code> is composed 3 times. That comes out to a total of 6 times!</p><p>Bam, if we did that, it would represent multiplication.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-*</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [num-a num-b]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>num-a</span><span> (</span><span>partial</span><span> num-b f) v))))</span></code></pre><p>Here, <code>(partial num-b f)</code> represents our <code>g</code> function. </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-*</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>) (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>25</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm! </p><p>We’ve got numbers, we’ve got <code>*</code> and we’ve got <code>dec</code>. Next up…booleans! </p><p>To do this, we need to be creative about what <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is. </p><p>Let’s say this. Booleans are two argument functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-true (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                   </span><span>when-true</span><span>))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-false (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                    </span><span>when-false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>They take a “true” case and a “false” case. Our <code>church-true</code> function would return the true case, and <code>church-false</code> function would return the false case. </p><p>That’s it. Surprisingly this is enough to handle booleans. Here’s how we could convert them to Clojure bools.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-bool-&gt;bool [church-bool]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-bool</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>church-true</code> would return the first argument (true), and our <code>church-false</code> would return the second one! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-true)</span>
<span>; =&gt; true</span>
<span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-false)</span>
<span>; =&gt; false</span></code></pre><p>Do they look familiar? …</p></span></p></div>

    <p>Although I still read a lot, during my college sophomore years my reading
habits shifted from novels to more academic works. Indeed, reading dry
textbooks and economic papers for classes often kept me from reading anything
else substantial. Nowadays, I tend to binge read novels: I won't touch a book
for months on end, and suddenly, I'll read 10 novels back to back<sup id="fnref:dune"><a href="#fn:dune" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At the start of a novel binge, I always follow the same ritual: I take out my
e-reader from its storage box, marvel at the fact the battery is still pretty
full, turn on the WiFi and check if there are OS updates. And I have to admit,
Kobo Inc. (now Rakuten Kobo) has done a stellar job of keeping my e-reader up
to date. I've owned this model (a Kobo Aura 1<sup>st</sup> generation) for 7
years now and I'm still running the latest version of Kobo's Linux-based OS.</p>

to Android 10<sup id="fnref:nexus"><a href="#fn:nexus" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, I asked myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why is my e-reader still getting regular OS updates, while Google stopped
issuing security patches for my smartphone four years ago?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To try to answer this, let us turn to economic incentives
theory.</p>
<p>Although not the be-all and end-all some think it is<sup id="fnref:incentives"><a href="#fn:incentives" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, incentives
theory is not a bad tool to analyse this particular problem. Executives at
Google most likely followed a very business-centric logic when they decided to
drop support for the Nexus 5. Likewise, Rakuten Kobo's decision to continue
updating older devices certainly had very little to do with ethics or loyalty
to their user base.</p>
<p>So, what are the incentives that keep Kobo updating devices and why are they
different than smartphone manufacturers'?</p>
<h2>A portrait of the current long-term software support offerings for smartphones and e-readers</h2>
<p>Before delving deeper in economic theory, let's talk data. I'll be focusing on
2 brands of e-readers, Amazon's Kindle and Rakuten's Kobo. Although the
e-reader market is highly segmented and differs a lot based on geography,
Amazon was in 2015 the clear worldwide leader with 53% of the worldwide
e-reader sales, followed by Rakuten Kobo at 13%<sup id="fnref:ereader_sales"><a href="#fn:ereader_sales" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On the smartphone side, I'll be differentiating between Apple's iPhones and
Android devices, taking Google as the barometer for that ecosystem. As mentioned
below, Google is sadly the leader in long-term Android software support.</p>
<h4>Rakuten Kobo</h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019690433">their website</a> and to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_eReader#Chronological_Overview">Wikipedia
table</a>, the only e-readers Kobo has deprecated are the original
Kobo eReader and the Kobo WiFi N289, both released in 2010. This makes their
oldest still supported device the Kobo Touch, released in 2011. In my book,
that's a pretty good track record.  Long-term software support does not seem to
be advertised or to be a clear selling point in their marketing.</p>
<h4>Amazon</h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW">their website</a>, Amazon has dropped support for
all 8 devices produced before the Kindle Paperwhite 2<sup>nd</sup> generation,
first sold in 2013. To put things in perspective, the first Kindle came out in
2007, 3 years before Kobo started selling devices. Like Rakuten Kobo, Amazon
does not make promises of long-term software support as part of their
marketing. </p>
<h4>Apple</h4>
<p>Apple has a very clear <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201624">software support policy</a> for all their
devices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod or Mac products may obtain a service and parts
from Apple or Apple service providers for five years after the product is no
longer sold – or longer, where required by law.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means in the worst-case scenario of buying an iPhone model just as it is
discontinued, one would get a minimum of 5 years of software support.</p>
<h4>Android</h4>
<p>Google's policy for their Android devices is to provide software support for <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en">3
years after the launch date</a>. If you buy a Pixel device just
before the new one launches, you could theoretically only get 2 years of
support. In 2018, Google decided OEMs would have to provide security updates
for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18019356/android-security-update-mandate-google-contract">at least 2 years</a> after launch, threatening not to license
Google Apps and the Play Store if they didn't comply.</p>
<h2>A question of cost structure</h2>
<p>From the previous section, we can conclude that in general, e-readers seem to
be supported longer than smartphones, and that Apple does a better job than
Android OEMs, providing support for about twice as long.</p>
<p>Even Fairphone, <strong>who's entire business is to build phones designed to last and
to be repaired</strong> was not able to keep the Fairphone 1 (2013) updated for more
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairphone_1#Software_updates">a couple years</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairphone_2#Software">seems to be struggling</a> to keep the
Fairphone 2 (2015) running an up to date version of Android.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever worked in IT will tell you: maintaining software over time
is hard work and hard work by specialised workers is expensive. Most commercial
electronic devices are sold and developed by for-profit enterprises and
software support all comes down to a question of cost structure. If companies
like Google or Fairphone are to be expected to provide long-term support for
the devices they manufacture, they have to be able to fund their work somehow.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, people would be paying for the cost of said long-term
support, as it would likely be cheaper then buying new devices every few years
and would certainly be better for the planet. Problem is, manufacturers aren't
making them pay for it.</p>
<p>Economists call this type of problem externalities: things that should be
part of the cost of a good, but aren't for one a reason or another. A classic
example of an externality is pollution. Clearly pollution is bad and leads to
horrendous consequences, like climate change. Sane people agree we should
drastically cut our greenhouse gas emissions, and yet, we aren't.</p>
<p>Neo-classical economic theory argues the way to fix externalities like
pollution is to <em>internalise</em> these costs, in other words, to make people pay
for the "real price" of the goods they buy. In the case of climate change and
pollution, neo-classical economic theory is plain wrong (spoiler alert: it
often is), but this is where band-aids like the carbon tax comes from.</p>
<p>Still, coming back to long-term software support, let's see what would happen
if we were to try to internalise software maintenance costs. We can do this
multiple ways.</p>
<h3>1 - Include the price of software maintenance in the cost of the device</h3>
<p>This is the choice Fairphone makes. This might somewhat work out for them since
they are a very small company, but it cannot scale for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This strategy relies on you giving your money to an enterprise <u>now</u>,
   and trusting them to "Do the right thing" <u>years later</u>. As the years
   go by, they will eventually look at their books, see how much ongoing
   maintenance is costing them, drop support for the device, apologise and move
   on. That is to say, enterprises have a clear economic incentive to promise
   long-term support and not deliver. One could argue a company's reputation
   would suffer from this kind of behaviour. Maybe sometime it does, but most
   often people forget. Political promises are a great example of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprises go bankrupt all the time. Even if company X promises 15 years of
   software support for their devices, if they cease to exist, your device will
   stop getting updates. The internet is full of stories of IoT devices getting
   bricked when the parent company goes bankrupt and their servers disappear.
   This is related to point number 1: to some degree, you have a disincentive
   to pay for long-term support in advance, as the future is uncertain and
   there are chances you won't get the support you paid for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selling your devices at a higher price to cover maintenance costs does not
   necessarily mean you will make more money overall — raising more money to
   fund maintenance costs being the goal here. To a certain point, smartphone
   models are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good">substitute goods</a> and prices higher than market prices will
   tend to drive consumers to buy cheaper ones. There is thus a disincentive to
   include the price of software maintenance in the cost of the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People tend to be bad at rationalising the total cost of ownership over a
   long period of time. Economists call this phenomenon
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting">hyperbolic discounting</a>. In our case, it means people are far more likely
   to buy a 500$ phone each 3 years than a 1000$ phone each 10 years. Again,
   this means OEMs have a clear disincentive to include the price of long-term
   software maintenance in their devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, life is more complex than how I portrayed it: enterprises are not
perfect rational agents, altruism exists, not all enterprises aim solely for
profit maximisation, etc. Still, in a capitalist economy, enterprises wanting
to charge for software maintenance upfront have to overcome these hurdles one
way or another if they want to avoid failing.</p>
<h3>2 - The subscription model</h3>
<p>Another way companies can try to internalise support costs is to rely on a
subscription-based revenue model. This has multiple advantages over the previous
option, mainly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It does not affect the initial purchase price of the device, making it easier
   to sell them at a competitive price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It provides a stable source of income, something that is <em>very</em> valuable to
   enterprises, as it reduces overall risks. This in return creates an incentive
   to continue providing software support as long as people are paying.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If this model is so interesting from an economic incentives point of view, why
isn't any smartphone manufacturer offering that kind of program? The answer is,
they are, but not explicitly<sup id="fnref:subscribe"><a href="#fn:subscribe" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Apple and Google can fund part of their smartphone software support via the 30%
cut they take out of their respective app stores. A <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2019">report from Sensor
Tower</a> shows that in 2019, Apple made an estimated US$ 16 billion
from the App Store, while Google raked in US$ 9 billion from the Google Play
Store. Although the <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019">Fortune 500 ranking</a> tells us this respectively
is "only" 5.6% and 6.5% of their gross annual revenue for 2019, the profit
margins in this category are certainly higher than any of their other products.</p>
<p>This means Google and Apple have an important incentive to keep …</p></div></div>

<p>Legos are an excellent meta-toy in that they represent the potential for a near-infinite number of toys depending on how you assemble them. Each brick has structure. But each brick is only interesting to the extent that it can combine with other bricks, forming new and more complex structures. So in order to enjoy Legos, you have to figure out how they fit together and come up with a clever way of making the particular toy you have in mind. Once you have mastered a few simple rules, the open-ended design of Lego bricks lets you build anything you can imagine.</p>

<p>Our universe has the same versatile structure. It seems to run according to just a few simple forces, but as those forces interact, they give rise to intricate patterns across many scales of space and time. You see this everywhere you look in nature – in the fractal design of a seashell or the intricate polities of a coral. In the convection of a teacup or the circulation of the atmosphere. And this simple structure even determines the shape and behavior of man’s most complicated flying machines.</p>

<p>To see this more clearly, we are going to start from the basic physical laws of airflow and use them to derive the shape of a wing.<sup id="fnref:fn18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn18">1</a></sup> Since we are using so few assumptions, the wing shape we come up with will be as fundamental as the physics of the air that swirls around it. This is pretty fundamental. In fact, if an alien species started building flying machines on another planet, they would probably converge on a similar shape.</p>

<h3 id="navier-stokes">Navier-Stokes</h3>

<p>We will begin this journey with the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Navier-Stokes-equation">Navier-Stokes equation</a>, which sums up pretty much everything we know about fluid dynamics. It describes how tiny fluid parcels interact with their neighbors. The process of solving fluid dynamics problems comes down to writing out this equation and then deciding which terms we can safely ignore. In our case, we would like to simulate the flow of air through a wind tunnel and then use it to evaluate various wing shapes.</p>

<p>Since the pressure differences across a wind tunnel are small, one of the first assumptions we can make is that air is incompressible. This lets us use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow">incompressible form</a> of the Navier-Stokes equation:</p>

<p><span id="longEqnWithSmallScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} \\
~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span>
<span id="longEqnWithLargeScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} ~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span></p>

<p>Another term we can ignore is viscous diffusion. Viscous diffusion describes how fluid parcels distribute their momenta due to sticky interactions with their neighbors. We would say that a fluid with high viscosity is “thick”: common examples include molasses and motor oil. Even though air is much thinner, viscous interactions still cause a layer of slow-moving air to form along the surface of an airplane wing. However, we can ignore this boundary layer because its contribution to the aerodynamics of the wing is small compared to that of self-advection.</p>

<p>The final term we can ignore is the forces term, as there will be no forces on the air once it enters the wind tunnel. And so we are left with but a hair of the original Navier-Stokes hairball:</p>

\[\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} = \underbrace{- (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection ("velocity follows itself")}}\]

<p>This simple expression describes the effects that really dominate wind tunnel physics. It says, intuitively, that “the change in velocity over time is due to the fact that velocity follows itself.” So the entire simulation comes down to two simple rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		• Rule 1: Velocity follows itself <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<!-- <b>Rule 1: Velocity follows itself</b> -->
		• Rule 2: Volume is conserved <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>By alternating between these two rules, we can iteratively 1) move the system forward in time and 2) enforce conservation of volume and mass. In practice, we implement each rule as a separate function and then apply both functions to the system at every time step. This allows us to simulate, say, a gust of wind passing through the wind tunnel. But before we can direct this wind over a wing, we need to decide how to represent the wing itself.</p>

<h3 id="representing-the-wing">Representing the Wing</h3>

<div>
<p>The wing is an internal boundary, or occlusion, of the flow. A good way to represent an occlusion is with a mask of zeros and ones. But since the goal of our wind tunnel is to try out different wing shapes, we need our wing to be continuously deformable. So we will allow the mask to take on continuous values between zero and one, making it semi-permeable in proportion to its mask values. This lets us add semi-permeable obstructions to the wind tunnel as shown:</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.0</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.05.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.05</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.12.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.12</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.50.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.5</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_1.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 1.0</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="choosing-an-objective">Choosing an Objective</h3>

<p>Now we are at the point where we can simulate how air flows over arbitrary, semi-permeable shapes. But in order to determine which of these shapes makes a better wing, we still need to define a measure of performance. There are many qualities that one could look for in a good wing, but we will begin with the most obvious: it should convert horizontal air velocity into upward force as efficiently as possible. We can measure this ability using something called the lift-drag ratio where “lift” measures the upward force generated by the wing and “drag” measures the frictional forces between the air and the wing. Since “change in downward airflow” in the tunnel is proportional to the upward force on the wing, we can use it as a proxy for lift. Likewise, “change in rightward airflow” is a good proxy for the drag forces on the wing. With this in mind, we can write out the objective function as</p>

\[\max_{\theta} L/D\]

<p>where \(\theta\) represents some tunable parameters associated with the shape of the wing mask and \(L/D\) can be obtained using the initial and final wind velocities of the simulation according to</p>

\[\begin{align}
     L/D &amp;= \frac{\text{lift}}{\text{drag}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{\text{change in downward airflow}}{-\text{change in rightward airflow}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ -\big ( v_y(t)-v_y(0) \big )}{-\big ( v_x(t)-v_x(0) \big )}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ v_y(t)-v_y(0) }{ v_x(t)-v_x(0)}
\end{align}\]

<p>Solving this optimization problem will give us a wing shape that generates the most efficient lift possible. In other words, we new have the correct problem setup; what remains is to figure out how to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="optimization">Optimization</h3>

<div>
<p>We are going to solve this problem with gradient ascent. Gradient ascent is simple and easy to implement, but there is one important caveat: we need a way to efficiently compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the wing mask parameters. This involves differentiating through each step of the fluid simulation in turn – all of the way back to the initial conditions. This would be difficult to implement by hand, but fortunately there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a> which can perform this back-propagation of gradients automatically. We will use Autograd to compute the gradients of the mask parameters, move the mask parameters in that direction, and then repeat this process until the lift-drag ratio reaches a local maximum.</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<p>So let’s review. Our goal is to simulate a wind tunnel and use it to derive a wing shape. We began by writing down the general Navier-Stokes equation and eliminating irrelevant terms: all of them but self-advection. Next, we figured out how to represent a wing shape in the tunnel using a continuously-deformable occlusion. Finally, we wrote down an equation for what a good wing should do and discussed how to optimize it. Now it is time to put everything together in about two hundred lines of code and see what happens when we run it…</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/optimize_wing.png">
</p>

<div>
	<p>Final result</p> <p>[Click image to pause or play.]</p>
	<p><img alt="" src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/wing.png" onclick="toggleBasicWing()" id="basicWing">
</p></div>

<p>Sure enough, we get a beautiful little wing. Of all possible shapes, this is the very best one for creating efficient lift in our wind tunnel. This wing is definitely a toy solution since our simulation is coarse and not especially accurate. However, after making a few simple improvements we would be able to design real airplane wings this way. We would just need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate in 3D instead of 2D</li>
  <li>Use a mesh parameterization instead of a grid</li>
  <li>Make the flow laminar and compressible</li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from these improvements, the overall principle is much the same. In both cases, we write down some words and symbols, turn them into code, and then use the code to shape our wing.<sup id="fnref:fn14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn14">2</a></sup> The fact that we can do all of this without ever building a physical wing makes it feel a bit like magic. But this process really works, for when we <a href="http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/jameson-cincin-pm.pdf#page=36">put these wings on airplanes</a> and trust them with our lives, they carry us safely to our destinations.<sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn17">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Just like the real wind tunnels of the twentieth century, these simulated wind tunnels need to go through lots of debugging before we can trust them. In fact, while building this demo we discovered a number of ways that things can go wrong. Here are some of the most amusing failure cases:</p>

<p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/sim_bloopers.png">
</p>

<p>Several of these wings are just plain dreadful. But others seem reasonable, if unexpected. The two-wing solution is particularly amusing. We did not intend for this “biplane” solution to occur, and yet it is a completely viable way of solving the objective we wrote down. One advantage to keeping the problem setup so …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Technology has become as pervasive as the air we breathe today. While our reliance on technology keeps on increasing, there are a myriad of problems that complement the acceptance of these solutions for inconvenience. For instance, social media may have started as a force for good, but it possibly has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/the-social-dilemma-a-wake-up-call-for-a-world-drunk-on-dopamine">devolved into a state of dysfunction</a>, one that is all about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>. Likewise, online commenting may have built a degree of community and credibility over the years, but it has also led to a vast array of problems like online toxicity, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/08/05/why-facebooks-racism-problem-might-never-be-solved/">online disinhibition</a> and misogyny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it was Albert Einstein who adroitly stated that — <em>It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity</em>. Possible, but this is why checks and balances need to be put in effect to ensure that there is more than just a modicum of control. As more and more people are converted to a digitalized life, there are sure to be more issues that come to the forefront. If there are problems created by technology then technology will create solutions to those problems as well.</p>
<p>The focus of this post is — <em>The Future of</em> <em>Online Commenting</em>. At this particular juncture, let’s dissect the current state of online commenting, and its future. But before we do, let’s have a basic look at its history.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Brief Look at the History of Online Commenting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We hear of the whole concept of letters to the editor, and even letters that were sent to authors by readers. This was the type of commenting that was present; commenting is reminiscent of the older practice of publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor">letters to the editor.</a>&nbsp;With the advent of technology and online platforms plus the death of penmanship, the whole concept of —<em> letters to the editor</em> — have taken on the form of online commentary via enabling comments. </p>
<p>The first online website to offer a comments section was <a href="https://www.opendiary.com/">Open Diary</a>, which added reader comments shortly after its launch in October 1998. As the concept of analytics came to the fore, and a larger audience created greater brand value, which resulted in more sales, more and more companies embraced online commenting.</p>

<p>Towards the late 2000s, comments sections were quickly added to news sites. And, it was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2016.1205954?journalCode=rjop20">between 2007 and 2008 that there was a 42% growth</a> in the number of popular news sites with comments sections. In 2008, 75% of the top 100 most popular newspapers in terms of circulation had commenting systems in place. However, towards 2010, The American Journalism Review posited that newspapers offer <a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/what-is-gated-content-and-how-to-use-it-to-get-more-leads/">gated comments</a> or do away with comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution of commenting is the sign of the times. Many have agonized over the value of the conversations taking place online, but we see with the influx of social media platforms and blogging really taking off that online commenting is here to stay.</p>
<p>Building a commenting system where people would have to comment as their real selves, or moderating a commenting system where people were allowed to continue commenting under a different identity, has become an issue concerning the allocation of resources for many.</p>
<h2>The Future of Online Commenting has to Deal with Current Issues</h2>
<p>Online commenting and those who are privy to the world of such interactions are well aware of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/10-years-of-comment-moderation/553136/">mental toll that it could have</a>. While most commenting systems do offer the facility of pre-moderation, where all incoming comments are queued to await approval, this seems to be effective only to a certain degree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amp/2019-05-03-turn-off-comments-wont-fix-internet.html">Dr. Gina Masullo Chen</a>, assistant professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, states, <em>“I would rather use techniques that will improve the comment stream…and some of the things that improve them are really strong moderation and pre-moderation.”</em> That said there is no doubt that moderators face a serious mental toll in embracing this as a full-time job. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">The Trauma Floor</a>&nbsp;showcases the issues faced by Facebook moderators, and it is harrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the mental toll that moderating online comments has on its gatekeepers, there is also the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/future-propaganda-will-be-computer-generated/616400/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">specter of misinformation</a> that is looming large and terrifying. We have all heard of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">the Cambridge Analytica debacle</a>, and now we are faced with so much of disinformation spreading via online comments.</p>
<p>In a world that is teeming with so much of <a href="https://api-nationalgeographic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2020/09/coronavirus-origins-misinformation-yan-report-fact-check-cvd?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16005082450055&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s">fake news, like, for instance, regarding Covid-19</a>, it comes as no surprise that organizations desire to one-up their competitors. With a sea chockfull of content, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/is-facebook-organic-reach-dead/">organic reach appears to be dying</a>; this is certainly the case with Facebook. This is precisely why aspects like influencer marketing works where brands piggyback on the followers of influencers. </p>
<p>We hear of entities like <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/microsofts-ai-team-release-a-bot-that-can-generate-fake-comments-the-internet-asks-why">Bizarrely</a>, which is a team at Microsoft that has released work on an AI bot, called DeepCom. This initiative used to generate fake comments about news articles. This is the other side of the coin: While technology serves to solve certain problems, there are companies that will utilize technology to generate money. The intention is what counts at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Considering the various online facts regarding the aspect of commenting, you will realize that there are many issues concerning comments so much so that companies like <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/">Verge has done away with online comments</a>. News sites are known to be a nefarious cesspit of human thoughts. Yet, the question remains: Does getting rid of comments affect a site’s engagement and followership? It does, and yet there are outliers like the <a href="https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/371862/?usqp=mq331AQHKAFQCrABIA%3D%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16023963115219&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F06%2Finternet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality%2F371862%2F">National Journal</a> that saw page views increase.</p>
<p>Instead of doing away with online commenting, why not have real-time automated feedback as a solution? Instead of focusing on that age-old advice of <strong>Never Read The Comments</strong>, let’s focus on a solution. Commenting platforms aim to keep toxic conversations stifled with a combination of human guardians and up-to-date technology.</p>
<h2>Is the Future of Online Commenting Driven by AI? </h2>
<p>The future is here. <a href="https://micky.com.au/instagram-ai-automatically-hides-offensive-comments/?amp">Instagram is already on the way to using AI</a> to identify and block offensive comments. AI will also remind users that they are typing something offensive. AI tools work to flag and categorize harmful comments before a human can review them, thus helping to manage the workload and decrease toxic content. While there’s a possibility to dance around the edges of algorithmic detection, the fact is that this is better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of impartiality needs to be answered. Esther Berg’s opines that Instagram has <a href="https://nypost.com/article/social-media-censorship-conservatives/">unfairly silenced conservative thoughts</a>. Although this factor is not addressed in the article, one wonders whether this particular intervention was human or non-human. There is something known as <strong>adaptive behavior</strong>, which ultimately is one of the main concerns in designing AI-focused commenting systems. Basically, commenters can ultimately amend the word. For example, if <strong>chocolate</strong> is a banned word, it could be written as <strong>c h o c o l a t e</strong>.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact here is that AI is the future, and <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/ai-statistics/#gref">there are plenty of statistics to prove this</a>. By 2025, the global AI market is expected to be almost&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-industries-getting-revolutionised-by-artificial-intelligence-686a440857c0">$60 billion</a>. Moreover, the number of AI startups grew&nbsp;14 times over the last two decades. A comfortable prediction would be that commenting systems will be powered by AI yet with a human overseer. </p>
<p>Just like any technology that is used, the main stakeholders of that particular technology is human. Catering to humans is only possible with humans. AI has come a long way for sure, yet what is missing is the gap between the understanding that lies between both AI and man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humans are still the best when it comes to reading, understanding, interpreting and moderating content. Because of this, businesses that are focused on making their mark in the world will make use of both AI and humans when creating an online presence and moderating content online.</p>
<h2>Privacy is a BIG Issue </h2>

<p>Many news sites and blogs have chosen to go on a digital dieting strategy with regard to the endeavor of online commenting. This is because while there are too many issues with toxic commentary, there’s also the <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">issue of </a><strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">Privacy</a></strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784"> that needs to be considered</a>.</p>
<p>Most websites and blogs use a third party commenting system. Suffice to say, the focus of a commenting system is to initiate better conversations. However, the issue here is that systems like <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">Disqus and Facebook Comments track visitors</a>, and harvest their data for advertising purposes. Adding insult to injury, these systems even have the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">indiscrete ability to know what sites users have visited</a>. What is ironic here is that <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">many companies blindly use these systems</a> at the expense of privacy. Therefore, choosing a GDPR-compliant system is key. </p>
<p>Data that is tracked by Disqus, which may be revealed to third parties, includes pseudonymous analytics data, which inclides a user’s IP address, their web browser version and installed add-ons, and their referring pages and exit links.</p>
<p>Disqus has also been criticized for <a href="http://www.baekdal.com/insights/the-first-rule-of-privacy">publishing its registered users’ entire commenting history</a>, along with a list of connected blogs and services, on the publicly viewable user profile pages. Of course, there are other issues, too, like the fact that such a system is heavy and can lead to a decrease in page load speed. </p>
<p>Exactly why is data privacy important? It is important to consumers because a breach of personal information can damage an individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms, including the risk of identity theft and other types of fraud.</p>
<p>To maintain customer trust today, a company must demonstrate that&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/08/08/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;is one of its core values. Indeed, while many businesses still view privacy policies as a forgettable legal routine, there is a change in the consumer’s attitude. <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/11/05/data-privacy-trends-issues-and-concerns-for-2020/">Worryingly, as per a PwC research, only 25%</a> of consumers believe most companies handle their personal data responsibly.</p>

<p>Imagine moving to a neighborhood and finding that suddenly, your friends and family are ashamed of you. Employers turn you down when you tell them your address, your fiancee tells you her family is threatening to disown her if she marries you.</p>
<p>It sounds like a literary allegory for racism, but for 2-3 million people known as <em>burakujyumin</em> in Japan, it’s a historic precedent. <em>Burakumin</em> were once part of a broader despised caste, but now refers increasingly to sections of cities where that caste once lived, and the jobs that caste once had.</p>

<p>Particularly, leather tanning and butchering. An American researcher in Japan took a job in a leather working factory, and tells this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On the evening before I was to head off to my first day at the factory, I had received an olfactory warning from my 82-year-old neighbor, friend, and frequent dinner companion. The stench of leather, Nakajo-san explained, was atrocious. More than that, the smell of leather stuck – it clung to your clothes, to your hands, to your hair. While the odor might wash off initially, after time, after daily contact with the scent, the smell became part of you. I needed to be prepared to stink – and stink permanently – if I were really going to work in the factory. I also, and here Nakajo-san grew a bit more serious, needed to be prepared to eat dinner alone. He explained that he could not&nbsp;abide the smell of leather and that our shared evening meals would have to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some employees of banks have reported managers holding up maps of <em>burakumin</em>&nbsp;(“hamlet”) neighborhoods, warning the agents not to discriminate against people from those areas. One former clerk tells the story of a manager who delivered this speech, saying it was useful to know these neighborhoods so the agents could brace themselves to hide their disgust when they saw them. The intent was clear: “This is the map of people we don’t want to give loans to… but don’t discriminate… but check this map. You know, to <em>make sure you don’t discriminate</em> against the disgusting people who live there.”</p>
<p><strong>Defining Japan<br>
</strong>Japanese people are essentially identical to Koreans in origin, but a history of nationalism, represented by a divine emperor, has placed an imaginary sense of distinction into the blood of many Japanese. The cultural identities of some Japanese are distinct from this “pure blood” of the mainland: <em>Ainu</em> of Hokkaido and the Okinawan people have historically been considered Pseudo-Japanese, just above foreign residents of Japan. (Even multi-generational Korean migrant families are considered pseudo-Japanese). The Ainu have their own religion and ceremonies, deemed barbaric by their occupiers, while the Okinawans were seen as half-Chinese, owing to a history as a vassal state.</p>
<p>But even being “pure” Japanese didn’t keep you from full integration. There was a caste difference. Burakumin doesn’t refer to a national identity, but to “the hamlet people” who lived in ghettos on the outskirts of the cities. Essentially, outsiders.</p>

During the Tokugawa Shogunate, society was deliberately stratified into classes. We imagine the peasants to be the lowest class in a country where samurai literally had the right to kill them for any perceived insult, but there were worse people to be than the farmers toiling for a feudal lord, and one of them is the person responsible for clearing away the bodies of humans and animals or slaughtering animals for meat or leather. They were called <em>Eta</em> – “Filthy People,” or <em>Hinen</em> – “Non-People.”</p>
<p>Eta came first, long before the Tokugawa era, and Hinen came after, a term applied to everyone on Tokugawa Ieyasu’s shit list:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term came to include beggars, panhandlers, lepers, and Eta and later evolved into an all-encompassing name for occupations such as cleaners, gardeners, falcon hackers, butchers, harbingers, comedians, gravediggers and prison guards.</p></blockquote>
<p>These jobs were considered filthy for a handful of reasons. Cleaners and gardeners were not the artisans designing the gardens, they were the ones cleaning outhouses or carrying fertilizer for the gardens. Falcon Hackers and Butchers were similar, a falcon hacker cut meat into bite-sized pieces for Imperial falcons while they are hatchlings. Notably, many of these – with the absence of comedians, who basically were accused of “working blue” – worked in proximity to the royal court. Most were considered below peasants, who were elevated above merchants (taxes were based on rice, not income) and merchants remained one step above the “outcasts.”</p>
<p>Popular stories about them circulated widely. They had dog bones in their bodies but were missing a rib. That their necks didn’t cast shadows, their sexual and excretory organs were deformed. They were subhuman in the hierarchy of Tokugawa, a distinction that lasted nearly 300 years.</p>
<p>They were banned from leaving their ghettos after sunset, banned from wearing shoes, often had to wear identifying marks on their clothing. If they spoke to anyone – usually for matters of trade – they had to get on their hands and knees. Certain haircuts were forbidden, and if they wore them, a samurai could execute them on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Common People&nbsp;</strong><br>
Tokugawa-era rules said that once you took one of these jobs, all of your descendants belonged to the same caste. So why would anyone take these jobs?</p>
<p>Desperation and tradition, as best as I can tell, but no one seems to know for certain. Horses and cows were being killed in Japan before Buddhist law banned it in the 8th century; once that law was passed an entire class of worker was legally and religiously tainted. (The further away you were from the capital, Kyoto, the more likely you were to ignore these laws: Hence, concentrations today are still focused in Kyushu and Tokyo, then the outskirts of the country).</p>
<p>One important factor was the weird (to Westerners) distinction between wealth and class. Lots of samurai were poor, despite being near the top of the social hierarchy. Hide workers were paid by<em> daimyo</em> and merchants for armor, saddles, and other leather goods, even if they weren’t respected for making them, and as with any organization in Japan, they formed their own hierarchies and fiefdoms on the outskirts of towns (hamlets) with the other undesirables: Lepers, comedians, prostitutes, beggars, all of which eventually became <em>burakumin</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, they had no choice: They could <em>only</em> work in the professions allowed to their class, a distinction useful to Tokugawa’s policies of strict social control. Everyone still got leather, and the stigma reminded riot-prone farmers that things could be worse.</p>
<p>By the last year of the Tokugawa period, 1867, we hear rumblings of a rebellion amongst the burakumin. Only 9 years earlier, a court had decided that only the unwarranted murder of <em>seven</em> Eta people could earn the death penalty, because Eta were only 1/7th human in the eyes of the court. And yet, a struggling shogun seeking new sources of revenue decided to tax them (already a questionable proposition, as of course most of them were quite poor). The Eta people near Osaka refused to pay, and responded with a letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are considered unclean because we dispose of animals and eat their flesh. Yet, we have heard that Westerners eat the flesh of animals as part of their daily meals, and they are treated politely here. Even here, in our own country after the ports have been opened, high-ranking people are said to have developed a taste for eating meat. Hence, we would like discrimination against us to cease by abolishing the use of the word “Eta” to describe us. If that were done, we would willingly donate the requested money even if we must dispose of all our possessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years later, after the Meiji Restoration – a few years after the American Civil War – they got what they wanted. The government of Japan issued what some call “The Emancipation Proclamation” for Eta, giving them equal status and forbidding the acknowledgment of their history. It did not go well; riots in Okayama lead to Burakumin being burned in the streets. Even with their new legal status, the government was considering plans to round up Eta and force them to work in Hokkaido as farmers.</p>
<p>The name Eta eliminated, a few new ones emerged: “The New Commoners,” the “Special Kind,” which soon took on the meaning of “Different Kind,” even, briefly, “The Village People.” A surprisingly familiar attempt to govern attitudes through suggestion lead to another name, “Model Hamlet People,” and from there <em>burakumin</em> was born. Though still considered discriminatory, the word continues to be used by activists and academics, so I’m using it here.</p>
<p>Burakumin continued to work immersed in the smell of meat and hides, in abattoirs and tanneries isolated from the communities they served. These regions smelled like death. The workers smelled like death, and had for centuries. The religious stigma shifted to a social one, and then to a reflection of the neighborhoods they worked in. The idea of sub-humans remained.</p>
<p>Emancipation had a cost: Without legal distinctions, they became just another merchant class, now thrown into the same race and competition as everyone else. Socially, they couldn’t mingle with “proper” townspeople, could not marry out of their class. The only difference is that the government wasn’t involved in their repression – other people were doing it for them.</p>
<p>Burakumin could not find other work. They could not marry outside their closed impoverished communities, could not improve their social standing, despite the egalitarian meritocracy espoused in the Meiji period. This state of affairs lasted without government action for another 70 years – where the whole class of impoverished outcasts lived in forbidden and ignored neighborhoods marked by social exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Eta Redux</strong></p>
<p><em>“Die eta filth.” “Burakumin maggots.” “Drop atomic bombs on buraku neighborhoods.”</em></p>
<p>These are some examples of the graffiti documented by Kiwi researcher …</p></div></div>

As such, in this article, unless states otherwise references to the GPL and LGPL are references to version 2.0 of the GPL and version 2.1 of the LGPL.

The licenses refer to “compiling”, “linking” and “header files”, features of the C programming </span></span><span>languages</span><span><span> which may not be present in other languages that are not traditionally compiled. Similarly, the licenses do not expressly include provisions relating to features of object-oriented programming languages.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: In contrast, version 3.0 of the LGPL does relate to features of object oriented languages. For example, the definition of “Application” in that license discusses the effect of defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library."><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2">2</a></span></span></span><span><span> Do the GNU licenses work as intended when applied in these other contexts? </span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: The Free Software Foundation has strongly asserted that the LGPL may be applied to all known programming languages. See David Turner, The LGPL and Java, available at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-java.html (stating that “FSF’s position has remained constant throughout: the LGPL works as intended with all known programming languages, including Java.”). "><a href="#ftn3" id="body_ftn3">3</a></span></span></span><span><span> This article analy</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>es the Lisp </span></span><span><span>Lesser General Public License (colloquially and here referred to as the “</span></span><span><span>LLGPL</span></span><span><span>”), a specific attempt to apply the LGPL to a language with a programming paradigm and method of </span></span><span><span>building and distributing programs that traditionally differs from the approach of C.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: In a somewhat ironic twist, the history of the GNU licenses began with Richard Stallman’s distribution of Emacs, a text-editing program written in Lisp. Stallman initially distributed Emacs under the Emacs General Public License, out of which grew the first version of the General Public License. For an early history of the GNU licenses, see Chapter 2 of Glyn Moody, Rebel Code (2002)."><a href="#ftn4" id="body_ftn4">4</a></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p><p><span><span>Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages still in use. Lisp was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The language was first implemented when one of McCarthy’s graduate students hand-compiled the Lisp </span></span><span><span>eval</span></span><span><span> function into machine code, and created the first Lisp interpreter. Following in this history, while implementations of Lisp can allow for the compilation and distribution of executables, Lisp was traditionally developed and distributed as an interpreted rather than a compiled language. Lisp was closely connected to research in the field of artificial intelligence, and the popularity of the language declined in the late 1980s together with interest in that field. Nevertheless, Lisp seems to have enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence in recent years, and currently there are several open source and commercial implementations of the language.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Open source programs are not frequently written in Lisp.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: According to Black Duck, Lisp is not one of the top fifteen languages used in open source projects. See http://www.blackducksoftware.com/osrc/data/projects/. C is the most popular language, used in 44.95% of releases of open source projects. For a not-up-to date list of some commercial software projects in Lisp, see http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/lisp-companies/."><a href="#ftn5" id="body_ftn5">5</a></span></span></span><span><span> Nevertheless, certain features of Lisp have inspired a broader family of “dynamic languages” that can be considered to include popular languages such as PHP or Python. As with Lisp, for example, those languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled into executables. As such, programs written in those languages will also generally require the distribution of an interpreter together with the application. To the extent the LLGPL</span></span><span><span>'s</span></span><span><span> claim that the GNU licenses are not appropriate for Lisp is justified, the suitability of the GNU licenses for these other languages will also be implicated.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This article presents a close reading of the LLGPL license. In analy</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ing the license, this article attempts to understand whether, as the LLGPL claims, another document is necessary to apply the LGPL to the Lisp context. In addition, this article attempts to understand whether the LLGPL succeeds in its stated goal of translating the LGPL to the Lisp context or whether, in making the transition, the LLGPL moves away from the requirements and philosophical underpinnings of the LGPL. Before concluding, this article briefly discusses some issues raised by Lisp that were not expressly addressed by the LLGPL.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: Aside from the LLGPL, there are a number of other licenses that have been drafted to apply to specific programming languages. For example, PHP is distributed under a permissive license similar to the BSD. See http://www.php.net/license/index.php#code-lic. Python is also distributed under a permissive license. See http://docs.python.org/2/license.html. These licenses are generic and do not have any technical provisions that apply to features of specific languages. A number of other licenses contain provisions expressly adapted for particular programming languages. For example, the GNAT Modified General Public License is a version of the GPL which has been adapted for the “generic” feature of the Ada programming language. See http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gnat-gpl-edition/faq/. In addition, the Falcon Programming Language License is “specifically designed around the concept of an open source scripting language engine.” See http://www.falconpl.org/index.ftd?page_id=licensing. An analysis of these latter two licenses is beyond the scope of this article."><a href="#ftn6" id="body_ftn6">6</a></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p><p><span><span>The LLGPL was authored by Franz, Inc. (“</span></span><span><span>Franz</span></span><span><span>”), a leading commercial Lisp vendor based in </span></span><span><span>California. Franz is the corporate developer of “Allegro Common Lisp”, one of several commercial implementations of the “ANSI Common Lisp” standard.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: Commercial implementations of Lisp also includes LispWorks. Open source implementations of Lisp include Steel Bank Common Lisp, which is licensed under BSD-style licenses and also includes code in the public domain (See http://www.sbcl.org/history.html), GNU Common Lisp, available under the LGPL (See http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gcl), and GNU Clisp, available under the GPL (See http://www.clisp.org/). "><a href="#ftn7" id="body_ftn7">7</a></span></span></span><span><span> The ANSI Common Lisp </span></span><span><span>standard was developed in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify the several dialects of the language.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See the history of Lisp at http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf"><a href="#ftn8" id="body_ftn8">8</a></span></span></span><span><span> Franz initially began distributing Allegro Common Lisp in 1986, and authored the LLGPL in 2000. Franz has shown a commitment to the open source development of software, and has licensed a number of open source software projects under the terms of the LLGPL.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See http://opensource.franz.com/"><a href="#ftn9" id="body_ftn9">9</a></span></span></span><span><span> Unfortunately, there is a dearth of commentary regarding the interpretation of the LLGPL. As such, and as the provisions of the license are not always completely clear, the application of the LLGPL to software may not always be completely straightforward.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The LLGPL is a short document, consisting of five not-lengthy paragraphs, and by its terms is intended to be read as a “preamble” to the LGPL.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: The concept of presenting the LLGPL as a preamble to the GNU license seems to be inspired by the structure of the LGPL itself, which begins with a preamble that explains the goals of the license."><a href="#ftn10" id="body_ftn10">10</a></span></span></span><span><span> Generally, the LGPL permits proprietary applications to be combined and distributed with LGPL-licensed libraries, and does not require that the source code of the proprietary application be disclosed. This is in contrast to the stronger “copyleft” requirements of the GPL, which generally requires that all works “based on” a GPL-licensed work also be distributed under the same license terms. The LLGPL is intended to adapt the weaker copyleft provisions of the LGPL to the Lisp setting. In the words of the first paragraph of the LLGPL, the “LGPL uses terminology more appropriate for a program written in C than one written in Lisp” and, as such, some “clarifications” are necessary to apply the LGPL in the Lisp context. </span></span></p><p><span><span>The first paragraph of the LLGPL implies that the application of the LLGPL results in licensing terms that are not very different than the LGPL itself, even though they have been translated to the Lisp context.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: On its website, Franz itself provides a somewhat more ambiguous description of the LLGPL, stating that the document is a “new license” which is intended to take the special features of dynamic programming languages into consideration. See http://opensource.franz.com/"><a href="#ftn11" id="body_ftn11">11</a></span></span></span><span><span> Even so, several provisions of the LLGPL seem to belie this understanding of the license. For example, the LLGPL provides that a “Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but this does not mean that the application is necessarily a ‘work based on the Library’ it contains.”</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See the last sentence of the second paragraph of the LLGPL."><a href="#ftn12" id="body_ftn12">12</a></span></span></span><span><span> In contrast, the LGPL expressly provides that a work containing portions of the Library should be considered a derivative work of the Library under copyright law, and a “work based on the Library” under the LGPL.”</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: For example, the definition of “Library” in the LGPL provides that a “work based on the Library” includes a “work containing the Library or a portion of it. Similarly, section 5 of the LGPL provides that “linking a ‘work that uses the Library’ with the Library creates … a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library).”"><a href="#ftn13" id="body_ftn13">13</a></span></span></span><span><span> The clause in the LLGPL seems to contradict express provisions of the LGPL. Unfortunately, the LLGPL does not explain the motivation for making this fundamental change in the terms of the LGPL. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Other clauses of the LLGPL also seem to diverge from the provisions of the LGPL. For example, the LLGPL provides that “[i]t is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it must be done in a way such that the Library will still run without that proprietary code present.”</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the LLGPL."><a href="#ftn14" id="body_ftn14">14</a></span></span></span><span><span> This seems to restrict a user’s ability to modify the licensed work. Interpreting this sentence in light of the </span></span><span><span>LGPL is quite difficult, as Section 2 of the LGPL expressly provides a user of the Library with the right to modify and copy the Library, without any requirement to ensure that it can still run without those modifications.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: Indeed, one of the core freedoms advocated by the Free Software Foundation is the freedom to modify software. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html. The LGPL also evidences a similar concern that a modified Library should be able to operate even without the application that it is linked with. See Section 2(d) of the LGPL. Even so, that concern is with regard to the use of the licensed work when distributed to third parties, but the literal reading of the LLGPL provides no suggestion that it should be read as anything but a restriction of a user’s right to modify the program, regardless of whether the modified version is distributed to third parties. In addition, the LGPL only requires that users make a “good faith effort” to ensure the operation of the modified library. In contrast, the LLGPL’s requirement is formulated as an absolute requirement."><a href="#ftn15" id="body_ftn15">15</a></span></span></span><span><span> Again, the LLGPL does not describe the reasons for </span></span><span><span>adding this requirement to the provisions of the LGPL.</span></span></p><p>These examples demonstrate that it is difficult to reconcile certain provisions of the LLGPL with the original GNU license. Indeed, this article shows that the LLGPL does clarify certain provisions of the LGPL in the Lisp setting, but also substantially modifies the provisions of the original license. Unfortunately, the LLGPL is frequently not explicit regarding whether a specific provision should be seen as a “translation” to the Lisp context or as an intentional change in the licensing terms of the LGPL. Furthermore, the LLGPL does not always explain its motivation for making certain clarifications or changes, and this can make it difficult to interpret and apply the license. </p><p>Several provisions of the LLGPL seem to be motivated by an attempt to clarify the provisions of the LGPL in the Lisp setting. For example, the second paragraph of the LLGPL changes several definitions of the LGPL, such as the definitions of “library”, “function” and “data”, making them more amenable to the Lisp context. The second paragraph reads in full:</p><p>A “Library” in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and foreign modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for processing by an interpreter) or object code (usually the result of compilation of source code or built with some other mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can be linked into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we do so in the most general way to include, in addition, methods and unnamed functions. Lisp “data” is also a general term that includes the data structures resulting from defining Lisp classes. A Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but this does not mean that the application is necessarily a “work based on the Library” it contains. &nbsp;</p><p>These revised and generali<span>s</span>ed definitions are to some extent useful in clarifying LGPL terminology for Lisp. At the same time, however, the revisions appear to focus on certain aspects of the technical distinctiveness of Lisp which would not seem to materially affect the interpretation of the LGPL. </p><p><span><span>For example, the first sentence of the second paragraph provides that “[a] ‘Library’ in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and foreign modules.”</span></span><a name="_Ref334504046"><span><span><span title="Footnote: A “foreign module”, according to the LLGPL, is “object code in a form that can be linked into a Lisp executable”. Briefly, Lisp data types often differ from data types in other languages. As such, Lisp requires a “foreign function interface” in order to link code written in a different language. See generally Peter Seibel, Practical Common Lisp, 467 (2005). The existence of foreign modules and the need for a “foreign function interface” is not unique to Lisp. For example, the “Java Native Interface” enables a Java Virtual Machine to invoke (and be invoked by) the native code of libraries and applications written in other languages. The Perl XS interface also allows Perl to use C libraries. The Python extension module API allows the calling of library functions and system calls."></span></span></span></a><a href="#ftn16" id="body_ftn16">16</a><span><span> The purpose of this definition seems to be </span></span><span><span>the subtle modification of the definition of a “library” (not capitali</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ed)</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: The LGPL contains a definition of “library” (not capitalised) and “Library” (capitalised). The former provides a generic description of a software library, while the latter refers to the specific work licensed under the LGPL. The need for the former generic definition of a software library is not clear in the document and, indeed, version 3 of the LGPL omits this generic definition. In version 3 of the LGPL, a “Library” simply means a “covered work governed by this License.”"><a href="#ftn17" id="body_ftn17">17</a></span></span></span><span><span> in the LGPL, which provides that a library means “a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to </span></span><span><span>form …</span></span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi All! Welcome back to part 11 of our <strong>Blazor 2d Gamedev </strong>series. Today we’re going to refactor and improve the code responsible for <strong>loading assets</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-gamedev-part-10-the-scene-graph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last time </a>we talked about <strong>Scene Graphs</strong> and how they can help us managing our Game Entities. We used the classic solar system example, with every planet represented by its own asset, loaded separately.</p><p>Our goal now is to have a centralized asset loading mechanism and avoid the hassle of having to reference all our assets in a Blazor page or component. Basically, we’ll be moving from this</p><pre data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet1.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet2.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet3.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet4.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet5.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet6.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;</pre><p>to something much more simple:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;Assets Source="assets/assets.json" OnLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;</pre><p>Nice, isn’t it?</p><p>The idea is quite simple actually: instead of referencing each asset one by one (let it be a sprite, sound, animation, whatever), we’re going to load a <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/wwwroot/assets/assets.json" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single JSON file </a>containing the assets list along with its type:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="json" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[
  {
    "path": "assets/enemyRed1.png",
    "type": "sprite"
  },
  {
    "path": "assets/meteorBrown_big1.png",
    "type": "sprite"
  },
  {
    "path": "assets/playerShip2_green.png",
    "type": "sprite"
  }
]</pre><p>At this point, all we have to do is implement a <strong>Blazor Component</strong> that can parse this data, download the files and inject them into our Game. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Shared/Assets.razor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full code here</a>, but let’s see the gist:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
	var items = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;AssetData[]&gt;(this.Source);

	foreach (var item in items)
	{
		IAsset asset = null;
		if (item.type == "sprite")
			asset = await this.AssetsResolver.Load&lt;Sprite&gt;(item.path);

		if (null != asset)
			_items.Add(new Tuple&lt;IAsset, AssetData&gt;(asset, item));
	}

	await this.OnLoaded.InvokeAsync(this);
}</pre><p>Here we download the file pointed by the <em><strong>Source</strong> </em>property, loop over each item and use the <strong><em>AssetResolver</em></strong> instance to load it given the type. In our browser’s network tab we would see something like this:</p><div><figure><img width="598" height="378" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?resize=598%2C378&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?resize=598%2C378&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p> Once loaded, the items will be rendered into the page in a simple loop:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;div class="assets"&gt;
    @foreach (var item in _items)
    {
        // render item by type
    }
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>The <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Core/Assets/AssetsResolver.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>AssetsResolver</strong> class </a>will basically serve two purposes: loading the assets from the server and, well, <em>resolve</em> them when we need during the game (more on this later). Each asset type has to be registered in the <strong><a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Composition Root</a></strong>. An <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Core/Assets/Loaders/AssetLoaderFactory.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>AssetLoaderFactory</strong></em> </a>will be leveraged to do the matching type/loader:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AssetLoaderFactory : IAssetLoaderFactory
{
	private readonly IDictionary&lt;Type, object&gt; _loaders;

	public AssetLoaderFactory()
	{
		_loaders = new Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt;();
	}

	public void Register&lt;TA&gt;(IAssetLoader&lt;TA&gt; loader) where TA : IAsset
	{
		var type = typeof(TA);
		if (!_loaders.ContainsKey(type)) _loaders.Add(type, null);
		_loaders[type] = loader;
	}

	public IAssetLoader&lt;TA&gt; Get&lt;TA&gt;() where TA : IAsset
	{
		var type = typeof(TA);
		if(!_loaders.ContainsKey(type))
			throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException($"invalid asset type: {type.FullName}");

		return _loaders[type] as IAssetLoader&lt;TA&gt;;
	}
}</pre><p>In our demo we will have a single Asset Loader implementation, <strong><a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Core/Assets/Loaders/SpriteAssetLoader.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpriteAssetLoader</a></strong>:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class SpriteAssetLoader : IAssetLoader&lt;Sprite&gt;
{
	private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
	private readonly ILogger&lt;SpriteAssetLoader&gt; _logger;

	public SpriteAssetLoader(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger&lt;SpriteAssetLoader&gt; logger)
	{
		_httpClient = httpClient;
		_logger = logger;
	}

	public async ValueTask&lt;Sprite&gt; Load(string path)
	{
		_logger.LogInformation($"loading sprite from path: {path}");

		var bytes = await _httpClient.GetByteArrayAsync(path);
		await using var stream = new MemoryStream(bytes);
		using var image = await SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image.LoadAsync(stream);
		var size = new Size(image.Width, image.Height);

		var elementRef = new ElementReference(Guid.NewGuid().ToString());
		return new Sprite(path, elementRef, size, bytes, ImageFormatUtils.FromPath(path));
	}
}</pre><p>We first download the image from the server into a stream and then load it in memory. I’m using <strong><a href="https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ImageSharp </a></strong>for now as seems to be the only library at the moment to work in WebAssembly. I was evaluating <strong><a href="https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SkiaSharp </a></strong>as well, but when I wrote the sample it was still <a href="https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not working properly</a>.</p><h4>The reason why we need to parse the image data is that we need some useful info, like width and height. Yes, we could add those as attributes elsewhere, but we might also want to do some processing, like changing contrast/saturation and so on.</h4><p>So, this covers the loading part. Now with the easy part: using the assets in our Game. The code is not that different from last time: all we have to do is initialize our Scene Graph and populate it with Game Objects:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">var player = new GameObject();

player.Components.Add&lt;TransformComponent&gt;();

var playerSpriteRenderer = player.Components.Add&lt;SpriteRenderComponent&gt;();
playerSpriteRenderer.Sprite = AssetsResolver.Get&lt;Sprite&gt;("assets/playerShip2_green.png");

SceneGraph.Root.AddChild(player);</pre><p>Aaaand we’re done! The<a href="https://mizrael.github.io/BlazorCanvas/BlazorCanvas.Example10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> final result </a>is going to look like more or less like this:</p><div><figure><img width="600" height="330" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20600%20330%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blazor-assets-loading.gif?resize=600%2C330&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p>This is the last article of the Series. I really enjoyed writing again about gamedev stuff and seems a lot of people liked the articles. It also contributed to my <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003878?fullName=Davide%20Guida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MVP award</a>, so that’s definitely a plus 🙂</p><p>I’ll probably add something more in the not-so-distant future, who knows. For now, thank you very much for reading, see you next time!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few months ago, I discovered a remote code execution issue in the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> desktop application and I reported it via their <a href="https://discord.com/security">Bug Bounty Program</a>.</p><p>The RCE I found was an interesting one because it is achieved by combining multiple bugs. In this article, I'd like to share the details.</p><h3>Why I chose Discord for the target</h3><p>I kind of felt like finding for vulnerabilities of the Electron app, so I was looking for a bug bounty program which pays the bounty for an Electron app and I found Discord. Also, I am a Discord user and simply wanted to check if the app I'm using is secure, so I decided to investigate.</p><h3>Bugs I found</h3><p>Basically I found the following three bugs and achieved RCE&nbsp;by combining them.</p><ol><li>Missing contextIsolation</li><li>XSS in iframe embeds</li><li>Navigation restriction bypass (CVE-2020-15174)</li></ol><p>I'll explain these bugs one by one.</p><h3>Missing contextIsolation</h3><p>When I test Electron app, first I always check the options of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow API</a>, which is used to create a browser window. By checking it, I think about how RCE can be achieved when arbitrary JavaScript execution on the renderer is possible.</p><p>The Discord's Electron app is not an open source project but the Electron's JavaScript code is saved locally with the asar format and I was able to read it just by extracting it.</p><p>In the main window, the following options are used:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>const mainWindowOptions = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;title: 'Discord',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;frame: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;resizable: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;show: isVisible,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;webPreferences: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blinkFeatures: 'EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><b>nodeIntegration: false</b></span>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'mainScreenPreload.js'),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nativeWindowOpen: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enableRemoteModule: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spellcheck: true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>};</blockquote><p>The important options which we should check here are especially <i>nodeIntegration</i> and <i>contextIsolation</i>. From the above code, I found that the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option is set to false and the <i>contextIsolation</i> option is set to false (the default of the used version) in the Discord's main window.</p><p>If the nodeIntegration is set to true, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the <code>require()</code>. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:</p><blockquote>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp; require('child_process').exec('calc');<br>&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote><p>In this time, the <i>nodeIntegration</i> was set to false, so I couldn't use Node.js features by calling the <code>require()</code> directly.</p><p>However, there is still a possibility of access to Node.js features. The <i>contextIsolation</i>, another important option, was set to false. This option should not be set to false if you want to eliminate the possibility of RCE on your app.</p><p>If the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, a web page's JavaScript can affect the execution of the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/83bb065b4f6ed512d545c46389a7fdc114c94a54/lib/renderer">Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer</a>, and preload scripts (In the following, these JavaScript will be referred to as the JavaScript code outside web pages).&nbsp;For example, if you override&nbsp; <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, one of the JavaScript built-in methods, with another function from a web page's JavaScript, the JavaScript code outside web pages also will use the overridden function when the <code>join</code> is called.</p><p>This behavior is dangerous because Electron allows the JavaScript code outside web pages to use the Node.js features regardless the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option and by interfering with them from the function overridden in the web page, it could be possible to achieve RCE even if the <i>nodeIntegration</i> is set to false.</p><p>By the way, a such trick was previously not known. It was first discovered in a pentest by Cure53, which I also joined in, in 2016. After that, we reported it to Electron team and the <i>contextIsolation</i> was introduced.</p><p>Recently, that pentest report was published. If you are interested, you can read it from the following link:</p><p>Pentest-Report Ethereum Mist 11.2016 - 10.2017<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view</a></p><p>You can also read the slides which I used at a CureCon event:</p><p>The <i>contextIsolation</i> introduces the separated contexts between the web page and the JavaScript code outside web pages so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary faeture to eliminate the possibility of RCE, but this time it was disabled in Discord.</p><p>Now I found that the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, so I started looking for a place where I could execute arbitrary code by interfering with the JavaScript code outside web pages.</p><p>Usually, when I create a PoC for RCE in the Electron's pentests, I first try to achieve RCE by using the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer. This is because the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer can be executed in any Electron app, so basically I can reuse the same code to achieve RCE and it's easy.</p><p>In my slides, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/masatokinugawa/electron-abusing-the-lack-of-context-isolation-curecon-en?slide=41">I introduced</a> that RCE can be achieved by using the code which Electron executes at the navigation timing. It's not only possible from that code but there are such code in some places. (I'd like to publish examples of the PoC in the future.)</p><p>However, depending on the version of Electron used, or the <i>BrowserWindow</i> option which is set, because the code has been changed or the affected code can't be reached correctly, sometimes PoC via the Electron's code does not work well. In this time, it did not work, so I decided to change the target to the preload scripts.</p><div><p>When checking the preload scripts, I found that Discord exposes the function, which allows some allowed modules to be called via <code>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('MODULE-NAME')</code>, into the web page.</p></div><p>Here, I couldn't use modules that can be used for RCE directly, such as <i>child_process</i> module, but I found a code where RCE can be achieved by overriding the JavaScript built-in methods and interfering with the execution of the exposed module.</p><p>The following is the PoC. I was able to confirm that the calc application is popped up when I call the <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function which is defined in the module called "<i>discord_utils</i>" from devTools, while overriding the <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>.</p><blockquote>RegExp.prototype.test=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>Array.prototype.join=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "calc";<br>}<br>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('discord_utils').getGPUDriverVersions();</blockquote><p>The <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function tries to execute the program by using the "<i>execa</i>" library, like the following:</p><blockquote>module.exports.getGPUDriverVersions = async () =&gt; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (process.platform !== 'win32') {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const result = {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const nvidiaSmiPath = `${process.env['ProgramW6432']}/NVIDIA Corporation/NVSMI/nvidia-smi.exe`;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = parseNvidiaSmiOutput(await execa(nvidiaSmiPath, []));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (e) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = {error: e.toString()};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>};</p></blockquote><p>Usually the <i>execa</i> tries to execute "<i>nvidia-smi.exe</i>", which is specified in the <code>nvidiaSmiPath</code> variable, however, due to the overridden <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, the argument is replaced to "<i>calc</i>" in the <i>execa</i>'s internal processing.</p><p>Specifically, the argument is replaced by changing the following two parts.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55</a></p><p>The remaining work is to find a way to execute JavaScript on the application. If I can find it, it leads to actual RCE.</p><h3>XSS in iframe embeds</h3><p>As explained above, I found that RCE could happen from arbitrary JavaScript execution, so I was trying to find an XSS vulnerability. The app supports the autolink or Markdown feature, but looked like it is good. So I turned my attention to the iframe embeds feature. The iframe embeds is the feature which automatically displays the video player on the chat when the YouTube URL is posted, for example.</p><p>When the URL is posted, Discord tries to get the <a href="https://ogp.me/">OGP</a> information of that URL and if there is the OGP information, it displays the page's title, description, thumbnail image, associated video and so on in the chat.</p><p>The Discord extracts the video URL from the OGP and only if the video URL is allowed domain and the URL has actually the URL format of the embeds page, the URL is embedded in the iframe.</p><p>I couldn't find the documentation about which services can be embedded in the iframe, so I tried to get a hint by checking the CSP's <i>frame-src</i> directive. At that time, the following CSP was used:</p><blockquote>Content-Security-Policy: [...] ; frame-src https://*.youtube.com https://*.twitch.tv https://open.spotify.com https://w.soundcloud.com https://sketchfab.com https://player.vimeo.com https://www.funimation.com https://twitter.com https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/ https://js.stripe.com https://assets.braintreegateway.com https://checkout.paypal.com https://*.watchanimeattheoffice.com</blockquote><p>Obviously, some of them are listed to allow iframe embeds (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, Spotify).&nbsp;I tried to check if the URL can be embeded in the iframe by specifying the domain into the OGP information one by one and tried to find XSS on the embedded domains. After some attempts, I found that the&nbsp;<a href="https://sketchfab.com/">sketchfab.com</a>, which is one of the domains listed in the CSP, can be embedded in the iframe and found XSS on the embeds page.&nbsp;I didn't know about Sketchfab at that time, but it seems that it is a platform in which users can publish, buy and sell 3D models. There was a simple DOM-based XSS in the footnote of the 3D model.</p><p>The following is the PoC, which has the crafted OGP. When I posted this URL to the chat, the Sketchfab was embedded into the iframe on the chat, and after a few clicks on the iframe, arbitrary JavaScript was executed.</p><p><a href="https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html">https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html</a></p><blockquote>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="og:title" content="RCE DEMO"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="<span><b>og:video:url</b></span>" content="https://<span><b>sketchfab.com</b></span>/models/2b198209466d43328169d2d14a4392bb/embed"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta …</blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>From the moment&nbsp;we log onto the internet, we get bombarded with dozens, if not hundreds of digital ads. Ads for shoes, shirts, vacations, productivity tools, medicine, political campaigns, mortgages, even ads for next generation military helicopters, <a href="http://worlddefenseshow.com/">weapons conferences</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/sponsored-content/2020/06/the-digital-battlespace">“digital battlespace” management</a>, and <a href="http://pnclassaction.com/">class action lawsuits</a>.
</p><p>A <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/02/internet-users-spend-more-than-a-quarter-of-their-lives-online.html">2019 report</a> found that the average internet user spends more than a quarter of their life (nearly seven hours per day) on the internet, through a combination of mobile, desktop, and other devices at work and at home. A typical user might see several <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/how-many-websites-do-you-visit-each-day/">dozen to several thousand</a> web pages per day. Given how much time we spend staring at computer or smartphone screens, it is no surprise that advertisers devote much of their efforts to getting a piece of our attention through said screens.</p><p>So how many ads does a typical internet user see per day? Estimates vary greatly, with some clocking in at <a href="https://ppcprotect.com/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/">20,000 per day.</a> One might question what these companies are getting out of bombarding users with so many ads. After all, many <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/brain-memory-magic-number/story?id=9189664">psychology experiments</a> have shown that our short-term memory can hold only a limited number of separate items. The average is about 7 items, plus or minus 2, depending on the context and individual. There is also the issue of relevance - more than <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/new-study-has-ad-blocking-peaked/">half of online </a>users find that the online ads they see are irrelevant. This has been partly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/18/the-cost-performance-paradox-of-modern-digital-marketing/#200ee9e82a9c">attributed</a> to problems with inaccurate audience targeting data.</p><p>I decided to conduct an exploratory experiment and monitor how many Google display and banner ads I saw over the course of a single month of browsing activity. I used the <a href="https://adalytics.io/">Adalytics browser extension</a> to keep track of all my ad data to determine:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How many different advertisers are paying for ads to get my attention?&nbsp;</li><li>What types of ads do I see most often?&nbsp;</li><li>What proportion of the ads I saw were relevant or useful to me?</li></ul><h2>How many different ads did I see?</h2><p>Over the course of one month in 2020, I saw a total 4,975 ads across the 35 different websites I visited. Of these 4,975 ads, there were 397 unique advertisement sponsors.
</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/GFrlzaKOjOsSUQfE.png" alt="top-ads-barchart.png"></p><p><i>How many times did I see an ad from a particular advertiser?</i></p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/HSYRJBmnMukLbOcm.png" alt="top-ads-wordcloud.png"></p><p><i>Word cloud of advertisers whose ads I saw most frequently</i></p><h2>One advertiser showed me their ads over 2,000 times within the course of one month</h2><p>I was surprised by the large number of ads I got from the online lending marketplace LendingTree. Almost 40% of the ads I saw were from their company, for a grand total of 2,081 ads. Upon closer inspection, I realized that I had been reading an article on a statistics website and left the browser tab open for a day (but not in view). This particular website would unload and load new ads from Google and Pubmatic’s ad networks every 15-20 seconds - an ‘interesting’ practice that allows a publisher like the website displaying this LendingTree ad to garner a larger number of ad impressions (and revenue) per each site visit. This practice wastes a user’s network data and can also slow down browser performance.This situation illustrates a broader phenomenon - the AdChoices program was created partially in response to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) taking a closer look at the digital advertising industry in 2009. The resulting initiative was designed as a self-regulatory mechanism by the adtech platforms, but those platforms may have little financial interest in creating tools that enable users to reduce how many irrelevant ads they are shown. It is therefore unsurprising that <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/insights-attitude-towards-advertising-use-ad-blocking/">eliminating irrelevant ads</a> has become one of the top drivers of ad blocker adoption.</p><p>A recent r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/ir3247/if_the_same_ad_is_served_on_a_given_webpage_500/">Ad Operations</a> discussion confirmed that LendingTree most likely is getting charged for this multitude of ‘unseen’ impressions. Advertisers can utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_capping">frequency capping</a> to reduce the number of times a website visitor is shown the same ad and blacklist websites that inflate their impression counts through such means.</p><p>Disregarding this one problematic website, LendingTree was still the dominant purveyor of ads to my browser - 162 distinct impression loads. I discussed in another blog post how the Digital Advertising Alliance (which includes Google) created a self-regulatory initiative called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdChoices">AdChoices</a>, which in theory allows consumers to opt-out of seeing a specific ad multiple times by clicking on a blue triangle icon in the top right corner of an ad iframe. However, I showed in that exploratory analysis that a majority of ads do not include the AdChoices icon within their iframes, thus preventing users from opting out of seeing a specific ad unless they install an ad blocker. At the time this analysis was conducted, a majority of LendingTree’s ads that were observed neither included the AdChoices icon nor provided an opt-out mechanism upon clicking. In the latter case, the Blue AdChoices icon would simply take me to a <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762">Google Ads FAQ</a> that talks about Google’s Ad Personalization. At the time this blog post was written, I noticed that some of LendingTree’s ad do include a seemingly functional AdChoices icon that lets you opt-out of seeing their ads - the only problem is, after clicking this button and navigating to a new page, I would still see the same Lending Tree ads. Therefore, there was no way for me to indicate that I was not interested in LendingTree’s ads for the 2000th time, short of tweeting at their Marketing Team. (I will update this blog post if we get a response.)</p><h2>Breakdown of ads by category</h2><p>I used the <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/taxonomy/">Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Content Taxonomy</a> to categorize each ad I was shown and see what types of ads were most common. Categorizing the 397 unique advertisements showed 27 different IAB categories represented in this sample. Of these, “Technology &amp; Computing” ads were the most common, while “Shopping” and “Food &amp; Drink” were surprisingly under-represented in terms of the number of distinct advertisers.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/kGIMdiYyuoYKRLJg.png" alt="ads-by-category.png"></p><p><i>Pie chart illustrating the relative frequency with which I saw different categories of ads. Technology, business, and automative ads dominated.</i></p><p>I also had a fair number of different “Automotive” related ads showing up, both for cars as well as car insurance. I would broadly consider this category to be irrelevant to me, as I do not own a car nor want to own one. Showing car insurance ads to someone without a car does not seem to match the aspirational marketing maxim of “right person at the right time.”</p><h2>How many ads were relevant?</h2><p>Lastly, I sat down and reviewed the different unique ads I saw and labeled them as ‘relevant/useful’ or ‘not relevant’. This was obviously a very subjective exercise but an important one nonetheless. Irrelevant ads hurt user’s digital experience and they waste advertisers’ time and money. Entire industries have been built on personal data collection and the promise of marketing personalization, so this exercise was meant to serve as a very rough proxy for the success of that vision.</p><p>When labeling ads as ‘relevant’, I tried to be fairly open minded and include things that I’m not in the market for right now, but might be at some point in the next few years, such as replacement running shoes. I also included public awareness ads, such as those for coronavirus.gov or the public health initiative alonetogether.com. Of the 397 unique advertisers whose ads I saw (including multiple different products or ad copies), I decided 32 of them were relevant. The majority of these were for technology services, such as the cloud software monitoring company sonraisecurity.com, news related items (like a Bloomberg subscription or Politico sponsored articles), or coupon services. I got several ads for products I already purchase, such as TDAmeritrade’s brokerage services or Cloud Guru’s online tech education service. However, ads for things like <a href="http://covance.com/">Convance’s</a> contract clinical trial services, car insurance, coding bootcamps, or <a href="https://ncgmarketing.com/">digital marketing for attorneys</a> were not things I would ever need.</p><p>I saw these 32 ‘relevant’ ads a total of 666 times (auspicious, I know), and saw irrelevant ads 4,309 times. Excluding that one problematic website that served me thousands of LendingTree and other ads, reduces the irrelevant ads frequency total to 1867, or 74%.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Based on this small sample size analysis and accounting for the outlier of one website, I saw ~85 Google display ads per day. The majority of them (74%) were not relevant to me, and in most cases I did not have a way to opt-out of seeing them any more. I did get some ads from companies that were offering relevant products or services that I looked into further; some of these companies paid for more than 100 impressions to grab my attention, which underscores how some marketing strategies espouse a high number of touchpoints to interest a customer.</p><p>The example of LendingTree’s ad barrage, both on that one particularly problematic website, as well as on other sites, highlights how a lack of opt-out mechanisms and frequency capping can hurt consumers, and perhaps advertisers as well.</p><h2>Take away points</h2><ul><li>The proportion of ads shown to users that are relevant can be as low as 25%, probably even lower</li><li>A small number of advertisers can account for a disproportionately large portion of ad content served to users</li><li>Users are often not given any way to opt-out of irrelevant ads, excepting by installing ad blockers</li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><span data-nosnippet="">
<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-9/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the Compiling a Lisp series. In this thrilling new update, we
will learn a little bit more about x86-64 instruction encoding instead of
allocating more interesting things on the heap or adding procedure calls.</p>

<p>I am writing this interlude because I changed one register in my compiler code
(<code>kRbp</code> to <code>kRsp</code>) and all hell broke loose — the resulting program was
crashing, <code>rasm2</code>/Cutter were decoding wacky instructions when fed my binary,
etc. Over the span of two very interesting but very frustrating hours, I
learned why I had these problems and how to resolve them. You should learn,
too.</p>

<h3 id="state-of-the-instruction-encoder">State of the instruction encoder</h3>

<p>Recall that I introduced at least 10 functions that looked vaguely like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>Emit_mov_reg_imm32</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>Register</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>src</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc7</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc0</span> <span>+</span> <span>dst</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write32</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>src</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions all purport to encode x86-64 instructions. They do, most of the
time, but they do not tell the whole story. This function is supposed to encode
an instruction of the form <code>mov reg64, imm32</code>. How does it do it? I don’t know!</p>

<p>They have all these magic numbers in them! What is a <code>kRexPrefix</code>? Well, it’s
<code>0x48</code>. Does that mean anything to us? No! It gets worse. What are <code>0xc7</code> and
<code>0xc0</code> doing there? Why are we adding <code>dst</code> to <code>0xc0</code>? Before this debugging
and reading extravaganza, I could not have told you. Remember how somewhere in
a previous post I mentioned I was getting these hex bytes from reading the
compiled output on the Compiler Explorer? Yeah.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this is not a robust development strategy, at least with
x86-64. It might be okay for some more regular or predictable instruction sets,
but not this one.</p>

<h3 id="big-scary-documentation">Big scary documentation</h3>

<p>So where do we go from here? How do we find out how to take these mystical
hexes and incantations to something that better maps to the hardware? Well, we
once again drag <a href="https://tchebb.me/">Tom</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> into a debugging session and pull
out the big ol’ Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html">Software Developer Manual</a>.</p>

<p>This is an enormous 26MB, 5000 page manual comprised of four volumes. It’s
<em>very intimidating</em>. This is exactly why I didn’t want to pull it out earlier
and do this properly from the beginning… but here we are, eventually needing
to do it properly.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to understand all of this manual, nor will this post be a
guide to the manual. I will just explain what sections and diagrams I found
useful in understanding how this stuff works.</p>

<p>I only ever opened Volume 2, the instruction set reference. In that honking
2300 page volume are descriptions of every Intel x86-64 instruction and how
they are encoded. The instructions are listed alphabetically and split into
sections based on the first letter of each instruction name.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at Chapter 3, specifically at the MOV instruction on page
&nbsp; 1209. For those following along who do not want to download a massive
PDF, this <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html">website</a> has a bunch
of the same data in HTML form. Here’s the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mov">page for
MOV</a>.</p>

<p>This page has every variant of MOV instruction. There are other instructions
begin with MOV, like MOVAPD, MOVAPS, etc, but they are different enough that
they are different instructions.</p>

<p>It has six columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Opcode</em>, which describes the layout of the bytes in the instruction stream.
This describes how we’ll encode instructions.</li>
  <li><em>Instruction</em>, which gives a text-assembly-esque representation of the
instruction. This is useful for figuring out which one we actually want to
encode.</li>
  <li><em>Op/En</em>, which stands for “Operand Encoding” and as far as I can tell
describes the operand order with a symbol that is explained further in the
“Instruction Operand Encoding” table on the following page.</li>
  <li><em>64-Bit Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in 64-bit mode
(“Valid”) or not (something else, I guess).</li>
  <li><em>Compat/Leg Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in some
other mode, which I imagine is 32-bit mode or 16-bit mode. I don’t know. But
it’s not relevant for us.</li>
  <li><em>Description</em>, which provides a “plain English” description of the opcode,
for some definition of the words “plain” and “English”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other instructions have slightly different table layouts, so you’ll have to
work out what the other columns mean.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of some rows from the table, with HTML courtesy of Felix
Cloutier’s aforementioned web docs:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Opcode</th>
<th>Instruction</th>
<th>Op/En</th>
<th>64-Bit Mode</th>
<th>Compat/Leg Mode</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8,r8</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX + 88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8</em><sup>***,</sup><em>r8</em><sup>***</sup></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m16,r16</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r16</em> to <em>r/m16.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32,r32</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX.W + C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m64, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32 sign extended to 64-bits</em> to <em>r/m64.</em></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If you take a look at the last entry in the table, you’ll see <code>REX.W + C7 /0
id</code>. Does that look familiar? Maybe, if you squint a little?</p>

<p>It turns out, that’s the description for encoding the instruction we originally
wanted, and had a bad encoder for. Let’s try and figure out how to use this to
make our encoder better. In order to do that, we’ll need to first understand a
general layout for Intel instructions.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-encoding-big-picture">Instruction encoding, big picture</h3>

<p>All Intel x86-64 instructions follow this general format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>optional</em> instruction prefix (1 byte)</li>
  <li>opcode (1, 2, or 3 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Mod-Reg/Opcode-R/M, also known as ModR/M (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Scale-Index-Base, also known as SIB (1 byte)</li>
  <li>displacement (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
  <li>immediate data (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this information at the very beginning of Volume 2, Chapter 2 (page
527) in a section called “Instruction format for protected mode, real-address
mode, and virtual-8086 mode”.</p>

<p>You, like me, may be wondering about the difference between “optional”, “if
required”, and “…, or none”. I have no explanation, sorry.</p>

<p>I’m going to briefly explain each component here, followed up with a
piece-by-piece dissection of the particular MOV instruction we want, so we get
some hands-on practice.</p>

<h4 id="instruction-prefixes">Instruction prefixes</h4>

<p>There are a couple kind of instruction prefixes, like REX (Section 2.2.1) and
VEX (Section 2.3). We’re going to focus on REX prefixes, since they are needed
for many (most?) x86-64 instructions, and we’re not emitting vector
instructions.</p>

<p>The REX prefixes are used to indicate that an instruction, which might normally
refer to a 32-bit register, should instead refer to a 64-bit register. Also
some other things but we’re mostly concerned with register sizes.</p>

<h4 id="opcode">Opcode</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.2 (page 529) for a brief explanation of opcodes. The
gist is that the opcode is the <em>meat</em> of the instruction. It’s what makes a MOV
a MOV and not a HALT. The other fields all modify the meaning given by this
field.</p>

<h4 id="modrm-and-sib">ModR/M and SIB</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.3 (page 529) for a brief explanation of ModR/M and
SIB bytes. The gist is that they encode what register sources and destinations
to use.</p>

<h4 id="displacement-and-immediates">Displacement and immediates</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.4 (page 529) for a brief explanation of displacement
and immediate bytes. The gist is that they encode literal numbers used in the
instructions that don’t encode registers or anything.</p>

<p>If you’re confused, that’s okay. It should maybe get clearer once we get our
hands dirty. Reading all of this information in a vacuum is moderately useless
if it’s your first time dealing with assembly like this, but I included this
section first to help explain how to use the reference.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-piece-by-piece">Encoding, piece by piece</h3>

<p>Got all that? Maybe? No? Yeah, me neither. But let’s forge ahead anyway. Here’s
the instruction we’re going to encode: <code>REX.W + C7 /0 id</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rexw">REX.W</h4>

<p>First, let’s figure out <code>REX.W</code>. According to Section 2.2.1, which explains REX
prefixes in some detail, there are a couple of different prefixes. There’s a
helpful table (Table 2-4, page 535) documenting them. Here’s a bit diagram with
the same information:</p>

<p>In English, and zero-indexed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bits 7-4 are always <code>0b0100</code>.</li>
  <li>Bit 3 is the W prefix. If it’s 1, it means the operands are 64 bits. If it’s
0, “operand size [is] determined by CS.D”. Not sure what that means.</li>
  <li>Bits 2, 1, and 0 are other types of REX prefixes that we may not end up
using, so I am omitting them here. Please read further in the manual if you
are curious!</li>
</ul>

<p>This MOV instruction calls for REX.W, which means this byte will look like
<code>0b01001000</code>, also known as our friend <code>0x48</code>. Mystery number one, solved!</p>

<h4 id="c7">C7</h4>

<p>This is a hexadecimal literal <code>0xc7</code>. It is the <em>opcode</em>. There are a couple of
other entries with the opcode <code>C7</code>, modified by other bytes in the instruction
(ModR/M, SIB, REX, …). Write it to the instruction stream. Mystery number
two, solved!</p>

<h4 id="0">/0</h4>

<p>There’s a snippet in Section 2.1.5 that explains this notation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the instruction does not require a second operand, then the Reg/Opcode
field may be used as an opcode extension. This use is represented by the
sixth row in the tables (labeled “/digit (Opcode)”). Note that values in row
six are represented in decimal form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a little confusing because this operation clearly <em>does</em> have a second
operand, denoted by the “MI” in the table, which shows Operand 1 being
<code>ModRM:r/m (w)</code> and Operand 2 being <code>imm8/16/32/64</code>. I think it’s because it
doesn’t have a second <em>register</em> operand that this space is free — the
immediate is in a different place in the instruction.</p>

<p>In any case, this means that we have to make sure to put decimal <code>0</code> in the
<code>reg</code> part of the ModR/M byte. We’ll see what the ModR/M byte looks like in
greater detail shortly.</p>

<h4 id="id">id</h4>

<p><em>id</em> refers to an immediate <em>double word</em> (32 bits). It’s called a <em>double</em>
word because, a word (<em>iw</em>) is 16 bits. In increasing order of size, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>ib</em>, byte (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>iw</em>, word (2 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>id</em>, double word (4 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>io</em>, quad word (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means we have to write our 32-bit value out to the instruction stream.
These notations and encodings are explained further in Section 3.1.1.1 (page
596).</p>

<p>Overall, that means that this instruction will have the …</p></div></div>

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything other than that specific version of that specific library is …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I come across questions on how to get started in programming often. People are hungry to learn, but don’t know where to start or which path to take. This is made even more difficult these days due to a lot of different areas that exist, such as web development, mobile software development, game development etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although we live at a time when tutorials and lessons are abundant, a lot of it can feel overwhelming. What you need is a roadmap to navigate the topics. You want a structure to guide you in your learning. A lot of coding bootcamps follow an approach similar to a college curriculum. Working through these curriculums is frustrating because you don’t feel like you are learning anything substantial quickly enough. College curriculum is great if your goal is to get a certificate or a degree. They are not great if your goal is to learn the practical skills of software engineering.</p>



<p>Following is a roadmap that I have put together to help you guide yourself in learning how to program. Your mileage with this will depend on your current experience with coding. These days though, I expect a lot of people to have had some exposure to very basic coding concepts such as loops, if statements etc. Spending any more time on these concepts may not be worthwhile. What you want is a road map that gets you on your way to building things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here it is, my recommended roadmap for learning how to build software:</p>



<h2>1. Start with Web Development</h2>



<p>As I had mentioned, there are many different areas of software development that you could focus on. I recommend starting with Web Development because it has the quickest feedback loop. This will help you improve fast and learn various concepts quickly. Principles learnt here can then be applied to other areas that you may be interested in such as mobile app development or game development.</p>



<p>When learning web app programming, you will be required to pick up HTML, CSS and Javascript. These are core languages for building web apps. But what you want to spend more time and focus on is the backend server system. The backend systems are responsible for providing the data APIs that support your application. Principles that you learn building good backend systems will provide you with a strong software engineering foundation.</p>



<p>For the backend, you will primarily work with either PHP, Python, Java or Ruby. Pick any one that you feel comfortable with. I recommend Python or Ruby to start.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Prioritize building an end-to-end application first</strong></h2>



<p>One of the key principles for effective learning is to focus on depth first. Instead of learning a lot of concepts across the breadth of the topics, I recommend going deep into one specific area. In this case, I suggest focusing on building a simple end-to-end application first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will get a general idea of what it is like to build something from scratch. More importantly, you will feel great having a built a working app. The feeling of satisfaction from the progress will motivate and propel you forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point you are ready to unpack and dive deeper into various aspects of what you have built. </p>











<h2><strong>3. Dive deep into the principles of software architecture</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have built an end-to-end app you will find that learning a couple of frameworks and libraries will be enough to keep you going. Most coding bootcamps stop here. But this stops short of diving into the richer and more rewarding world of software engineering. </p>



<p>I recommend spending time learning software design principles, object oriented programming and various systems architecture patterns. You will learn the details of how to cleanly and effectively work with databases, how to structure your code to enable more complex systems, different design patterns and architectures. </p>



<p>Software architecture&nbsp;principles&nbsp;are timeless and will support you throughout your entire career. </p>



<p>Some great books I can recommend here are:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321127420&amp;linkId=4962a37ba12a94696993ef4f54eca9fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0132350882&amp;linkId=20953e9f7d1dd550a5b402f355cfc2a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code</a></p>



<h2><strong>4. Data structure and&nbsp;algorithms are super important</strong></h2>



<p>The importance of algorithms in software engineering can be surprisingly controversial. This is perhaps due to Silicon Valley tech companies relying on them in the interview process. It’s true that many professional software developers never look back at the algorithms that they vaguely learn in college.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s unfortunate. The reality is that deep knowledge of algorithms, just like software architecture are foundational requirements if you want to excel as a software engineer at the highest level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Check out the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201657880/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201657880&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;linkId=0eb37d6439098ac088b44d65937d4143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming Pearls</a> for some great practical thinking on this).<br></p>



<hr>



<p><strong><br></strong>I hope this roadmap gives you some sense of the various aspects that you can focus on to learn programming and launch a career in software engineering. I have not provided a time estimate here since your progress will vary. Learning something new and complex takes time. If you stick with it, a rewarding career is waiting for you on the other side.</p>

<p>It’s becoming more and more clearly recognized that the promises of the machine-learning revolution, at least for your average non-big-tech company, are not delivering the value that many had hoped for. That is, many executives are looking at the fleet of data scientists they hired and not seeing the return on investment they were hoping for.&nbsp; Here’s a quote from <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/3/why-ai-projects-fail-8-reasons">one of many articles</a> discussing the problem:</p>



<blockquote><p>Seven out of 10 executives whose companies had made investments in artificial intelligence (AI) said they had seen minimal or no impact from them, according to the 2019<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/winning-with-ai/"> MIT SMR-BCG Artificial Intelligence Global Executive Study and Research Report</a> .</p></blockquote>



<p>Beyond the fact that a lot of snake-oil salespeople over-sold the capabilities of AI in general, I believe that we data scientists, as a profession, have focused too much on algorithms and methods, and not enough on how to <em>deliver business value</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can deliver more value as data scientists by adopting a lean data science methodology that emphasizes experimentation and iteration at the product level instead of focusing on measures of model performance not directly tied to business value.</p>



<h2><strong>Lean Data Science</strong></h2>



<p>Lean Data Science is based in large part on the methodologies discussed in<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/"> The Lean Startup</a>. Data science projects in organizations of all sizes are a lot like startups: they’re highly uncertain, and they require a lot of upfront investment to build. Some might even say they’re <a href="https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/linear-and-circular-projects-part-1/">circular rather than linear.</a></p>



<p>That is, they’re highly uncertain because we are often working at the frontier of what’s possible — before embarking on a new data science project, we might not know if the data we need are available, or if even the state-of-the-art models will provide adequate performance. And, even if the data exist and the model is performant, we might not know if we can actually change customer behavior in the way we want. Unlike traditional software engineering where features can be well-scoped in advance and estimated with at least a reasonable degree of uncertainty,&nbsp; with data science projects we are often embarking on projects where even if we do everything correctly, success is far from guaranteed.</p>



<p>Of course, data science projects also tend to require a lot of up-front investment to get off the ground. Data scientists are expensive, and, anecdotally, I’ve spoken with many data scientists who might spend many months working on a project before it sees the light of day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This extreme uncertainty and high upfront cost is a recipe for disaster: many companies will invest a lot of money in data science projects, and see nothing from them. This makes the executives feel defrauded, and the data scientists disappointed in themselves. We must do better!</p>



<p>In the lean data science framework, we want to reduce our uncertainty as quickly as possible through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validated_learning"><em>validated learning</em></a>.&nbsp; In the Lean Data Science world, we do that by:</p>



<ul><li>Measuring business outcomes, not model performance</li><li>Shipping early and often</li><li>Embracing failure and accepting good enough</li></ul>



<p>By standing atop these three pillars, we can deliver more value to our business with more uncertainty — not in any one project, but across our entire portfolio of data science efforts.</p>



<h3><strong>Measure business outcomes, not model performance</strong></h3>



<p>The success of a data science project depends on the business outcome it inflects, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">the ROC</a>.&nbsp; When evaluating a new data science endeavor, it’s critical to measure how the product impacts actual business KPIs.</p>



<p>It’s very possible to build a model that has great accuracy, but for any number of reasons doesn’t actually positively impact the business. Maybe you can predict customer churn really well, but if your intervention to actually prevent that churn doesn’t work, then having more predictive accuracy doesn’t get you anything!</p>



<p>The top-line measure for any AI project should always be a business metric, never a technical metric. Technical metrics can help us to understand where improvements might lie, or where something might have gone wrong, but we must never lose sight of the business metric. At root, the technical metric might impact the business metric, but we have to keep in mind that the technical metrics mean nothing if it doesn’t move the needle for the business metric.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, this is easier said than done. When there is lots of time and noise between the model output and the business metric that’s being affected, it can be tempting for data scientists to just focus on the things we can control and forget about everything else. Metrics like “customer retention” can often feel this way because there’s a very long lead time to see if a customer eventually churns, and there can be lots of other things that might impact that decision along the way. However, we should still not be complacent! By putting together a robust measuring plan in advance and making use of <a href="https://medium.com/@gibsonbiddle/4-proxy-metrics-a82dd30ca810">proxy metrics</a> we can still make sure that we’re being disciplined in how we measure the impact of our models.</p>



<h3><strong>Ship Early and Often</strong></h3>



<p>We want to know as quickly as possible if our data science project is actually going to inflect the business metric we care about, so that means we need to get to the point of having a usable and measurable product as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>For our data science project that means we want to define what the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is — what that means is that we want to strip away all potential features, all potential nice-to-haves, and try to get to the point of testability as quickly as possible. This is a great place to get creative:</p>



<ul><li>Instead of deploying a machine-learning model with an API, can we deploy a scrappy version with some weights hard-coded into the javascript?</li><li>Instead of doing any modeling at all, can we use a rule of thumb just to test the product intervention and make sure our guess about customer behavior is right?</li><li>What is the simplest possible type of model that we think might work?</li></ul>



<p>The anti-goal is spending weeks or months fine-tuning a model that was never going to work in the first place. This is a grave danger for data science teams: spending weeks or months in the ivory tower optimizing for precision and recall only to deploy their model and watch it crash and burn when it goes live for customers.</p>



<p>We want to get a first version of our product out into the world as quickly as possible so that we can measure it. We want to know sooner rather than later whether or not our beliefs and assumptions about the potential business impact will hold and we want to know if the project is worth additional ongoing investment.</p>



<p>Of course, like the good scientists we are, we should be following the scientific method and making these hypotheses explicit <strong><em>before</em></strong> going out in the world and just running experiments willy-nilly. Building the habit of writing down explicit hypotheses about how our model is going to impact business metrics, and then being disciplined about testing those hypotheses can help us make sure that we’re learning as much as we can from our efforts.</p>



<h3><strong>Embrace failure and accept good enough</strong></h3>



<p>If we’re moving quickly and testing our product aggressively, many of those products will fail. Most of them, even. That can feel very scary — admitting failure is hard, but if we want to maximize the impact that we can have as data scientists, we have to <strong>embrace failure</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we are evaluating our models based on a business metric and that metric doesn’t improve, we should be prepared to drop that project and move on to another. We should make this decision unemotionally, and, critically,&nbsp; we should make sure that we communicate the riskiness of our endeavors to our stakeholders so that failure is seen as a <strong>learning</strong> and not as a reason to defund the program. Failure is a <em>necessary part</em> of a data science program, and the more and faster we fail the faster we will strike onto the product that truly unlocks step-change value for our business. One way to accomplish this is to communicate hypotheses (and note that they’re hypotheses!) up front, and then make sure to always broadcast the learnings from a project to a wide group of failure, even if the learnings are “this didn’t work.”</p>



<p>In addition to embracing failure, we should always be ready to accept “good enough” and be ready to move on quickly. We should recognize that 80% of the value in a Data Science project will come from the first pass at a model — if that works and we deploy it, we should be out looking for the next most valuable project, which probably isn’t tuning that model to make it marginally better.</p>



<p>Often, we can get more value out of three data products based on logistic regression than we can from one that uses the newest deep-learning algorithm. We should evaluate our investments of additional effort based on the expected business impact — if tweaking the model to get 2% improved recall isn’t going to have a large business impact, we should move on to the next task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some data scientists can end up feeling a bit disappointed when they hear this — they want to be working with the shiny new models and feel like they’re doing cutting-edge work. I would counsel these people to think hard about what it is they really want — if what they want is to <em>do research</em>, then maybe working in industry – especially an early-stage data science project or program that hasn’t yet demonstrated business value – isn’t the right place for them. If what they want is to <em>have an impact</em> (and reap the professional rewards that come with that) then they should recognize that that means prioritizing what is most impactful over what may be the most interesting.</p>



<h2><strong>&nbsp;Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>We want to maximize business value from our highly uncertain products. We can do that by taking a disciplined approach to validated learning in our data products. As long as we evaluate our work based on expected business impact and we are prepared to move on from projects that no longer seem …</p></div></div>

<p>SpaceX has just had its telecom license approved in Canada by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CTRC), paving the way for its Starlink internet service to become one step closer to reality.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>According to <em><a href="https://teslanorth.com/2020/10/18/spacex-starlink-internet-approved-canada/">Tesla North</a></em>, the CRTC’s Secretary General, Claude Doucet, explained the approval for a Basic International Telecommunications Services (BITS) licence, in a letter written to SpaceX CFO, Bret Johnsen.</p>
<p>“After consideration of the comments received, the Commission has approved the application and a BITS licence is enclosed,” <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2020/lt201015.htm">wrote</a> Doucet, in a letter dated October 15, 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/tesla/spacex-telecom-license-canada-starlink-internet/">Doucet notes the CRTC received 2,585 interventions</a> regarding SpaceX’s BITS application.</p>
<p>According to the Secretary General’s letter, a “BITS licence does not by itself authorize an entity to operate as a facilities-based carrier or non-facilities-based service provider.”</p>
<p>“All entities who provide services as a facilities-based carrier must at all times comply with the appropriate regulatory framework, including the ownership and control requirements of section&nbsp;16 of the Act and the Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations,” explained Doucet.</p>
<p>Next up, SpaceX needs to get listed as offering fixed-satellite services (FSS) in Canada with the CRTC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/tesla/spacex-starlink-internet-canada-beta-speeds/">Starlink is a low earth orbit satellite internet service, currently in private beta</a>. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk previously said <a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/tesla/starlink-public-beta-in-southern-canada/">he hoped ‘southern’ Canada would be part of upcoming public betas</a>.</p>
<p>Existing Starlink private betas are seeing download speeds over 100 Mbps. The service is targeting high speed affordable internet for those in rural areas. It’s a service numerous rural Canadians are waiting for.</p>
<p><a href="https://teslanorth.com/2020/10/18/spacex-60-more-starlink-satellites-800-orbit/">Earlier today, SpaceX launched another 60 Starlink satellites into space</a> aboard its Falcon 9 rocket, taking the total number of its satellite constellation to 835. Another planned launch of 60 Starlink satellites is pegged for Wednesday, as SpaceX shows no sign of letting up in its ambitious goal of offering affordable, high speed internet to remote locales.</p>

<h2>
&nbsp;Molecular Manufacturing and the Private Aircar</h2></center>

<center>J. Storrs Hall, PhD</center>


<p>Earlier this year I spent some time studying the problem of the design
of flying cars.&nbsp; This was initiated by a suggestion of Al Globus of
NASA Ames, who thought it would be a good way to get some of the aeronautics
people at Ames to appreciate the possibilities of&nbsp; molecular manufacturing.&nbsp;
I'm very grateful for the help of Eric Drexler with the project, and also
some suggestions from Jeffrey Soreff.
<br>Surprisingly enough, it's a non-trivial problem even with molecular
manufacturing. For fifty years, the private aircar, i.e. an aeronautical
vehicle which is functionally and economically capable of replacing the
automobile, has seemed tantalizingly close to reality. <a href="http://autogeny.org/aircar/montage2.jpg">Here's
a montage of a few real, experimental, and fictional ones.</a>&nbsp; This
hope has foundered on several stumbling blocks:
</p><ul>
<li>
Cost.&nbsp; For the performance required, an engine with power-to-weight
ratios of the gas turbine class is needed; these cost $100,000 and up.&nbsp;
For safety, the vehicle would require constant maintenance, raising operating
costs significantly.</li>

<li>
Safety.&nbsp; VTOL vehicles are difficult to fly.&nbsp; One typical experimental
one, the Ryan XV5 Vertifan, had two prototypes built; both crashed, killing
their pilots.</li>

<li>
Noise and other environmental impact.&nbsp; At low speeds, a well-tuned
automobile on smooth pavement can operate at noise levels of 10-20 dB;
it is possible for a car to approach people who are in conversation within
arm's length without being noticed.&nbsp; Helicopters, on the other hand,
are so noisy that plans for heliports in suburban areas evoke public outcry
and organized resistance.&nbsp; (Ducted-jet craft such as the Harrier are
noiser still.)&nbsp; This discrepancy formed perhaps the hardest technical
challenge of the entire enterprise.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Performance Parameters</h4>
In considering the range of possible modes of transportation, there are
two very clear local optima among all the possibilities that it seemed
extremely desirable to match.&nbsp; First is the family car, particularly
in terms of its payload capacity and the convenience of operation it provides.&nbsp;
Second is the flying regime of commercial jets.&nbsp; This is perhaps less
well known.&nbsp; For the 50 years preceding 1970, typical commercial air
travel speeds increased exponentially; for the next thirty, they remained
constant.&nbsp; Airliners fly just above the tropopause and just below
the speed of sound.
<center><img src="http://autogeny.org/aircar/speeds.gif" height="400" width="400"></center>


<p>Thus our design goal is a machine that fits in your garage, takes off
from your driveway -- quietly, isn't apt to flip over and dive into your
house while doing so, and cruises at 6+ miles up at 500+ mph.
<br>Designing such a machine illuminates many of the considerations that
will in all likelihood be typical of many early products of molecular manufacturing.&nbsp;
First, the interface of the nano-mechanism to the macroscopic world is
problematical.&nbsp; Surface films of moisture affect exposed nanomechanisms
like pouring molasses over conventional machines.&nbsp; Secondly, the major
considerations in conventional vehicle design, having to do with sufficient
power in the motor and weight (of motor and vehicle), essentially disappear.
<br>One of the most remarkable figures calculated in Nanosystems is the
power-to-weight ratio of the electric motor described in section 11.7.&nbsp;
For comparison, a typical automobile engine might produce 100 kW power.&nbsp;
Drexler motors producing the same power would occupy a volume of a tenth
of a cubic millimeter, about the same as a single hair from one of my eyebrows.&nbsp;
In practical terms, this means that in molecular manufacturing designs,
we can put motors everywhere with virtually no cost in weight or volume.
<br>This ability does not come without a cost, however.&nbsp; The greatest
cost to the designer is control complexity.&nbsp; This is to some extent
the same problem that has come to be the bane of software; it is easy to
create systems so complex that their designers do not fully understand
them, to the detriment of, among other things, their reliability.&nbsp;
Thus it behooves us as designers to exercise some restraint.
</p><center><img src="http://autogeny.org/aircar/powerdensity.gif" height="600" width="600"></center>

<h4>
Shape Changing</h4>
The quietest way to take off is to jump.&nbsp; Furthermore, if you're taking
off in an area with trees and buildings, and/or gusty winds, it is advantageous
to maintain contact with the ground until you're above the height of the
obstacles.&nbsp; Thus our aircar will be equipped with extensible legs
for jump-takeoff.&nbsp; I've designed legs that weigh less than an ounce,
fold up to be less than an inch long, and extend to the height of a five-story
building. They're essentially telescoping cylinders of diamondoid.&nbsp;
They contain thousands of motors, but in keeping with the principle of
simple control, all the motors do the same thing at the same time; the
leg as a whole has one degree of freedom.
<br>Shape-changing is virtually certain to be a major feature of molecular
manufacturing products. One of the more important contributions of this
work and my previous work on Utility Fog has been the development of a
general scheme for shape-changing based on the theory of laminar fluid
flow.&nbsp; Laminar flow, as described by the Navier-Stokes equations,
is fairly well understood, at least as compared to other ways methods of
describing a phenomenon of similar complexity (such as turbulent flow or
sets of specific routing instructions to each part of a shape-changing
mechanism.&nbsp; The novel part of the work is to develop a discrete version
that is applicable to multitudes of machines instead of a continuous fluid.
<br>If a reasonably well-characterized range of shape changes is desired,
such as the changes in the size and shape of a wing that adapt it to different
regimes of flight, we can pre-calculate the flows and produce a mechanism
made largely from very thin diamondoid sheets that slide across each other
(powered -- millions of Drexler motors embedded in them).&nbsp; This enables
us to design a machine whose wings resemble those of a bird for flying
low and slow, those of an airliner for flying high and fast, and disappear
completely when on the ground. Careful design allows us to produce structures
with a substantial fraction of the strength/weight properties of rigid
ones.&nbsp; Thus it seems quite achievable to have a vehicle with a tare
weight of 100 kg or so.
<br><img src="http://autogeny.org/aircar/scene.jpg" height="230" width="358">Another major
advantage of shape changing for aircraft is that in flight, all unnecessary
gadgets, legs, appendages, and other protuberances can disappear completely.
leaving a clean. completely streamlined shape (and greatly reducing drag).&nbsp;
Indeed, we can steer and control attitude by means of shape changes in
the wings and body, meaning that we don't have to have tail fins, canards,
or other separate control surfaces, further reducing drag.
<br>(Note, by the way, that using these techniques it is quite straightforward
to design a robot of humanoid height and strength what weighs 5 grams and
could collapse to the size of a ball-point pen (which incidentally weighs
5 grams).&nbsp; Note also that programming the controller for such a robot
is a considerably more difficult task, if indeed it is possible.)

<hr>
<center><img src="http://autogeny.org/aircar/extensible.gif" height="600" width="600"></center>

<center><i>Extensible legs.&nbsp; The structure supports the weight by
itself but is pressurized to prevent buckling.</i></center>

<h4>
Quiet Takeoff</h4>
The problem of noisy takeoff remains.&nbsp; The physical parameters of
the problem are that the noise depends on the velocity of the stream of
air thrown downwards.&nbsp; For reaction forces in the 10,000 Newton range,
(assuming vehicle, fuel, and cargo can weigh a tonne), any narrow stream,
such as a jet or rocket, will be too noisy regardless of how it is produced.&nbsp;
For typical parameters we need a stream cross section of at least 10 square
meters (e.g. a 12-foot circle).&nbsp; This cannot, however, be produced
by a propellor or rotor blades, since they produce substantial noise by
other mechanisms.&nbsp; My proposal is a retractable sail of "fancloth"
-- a fabric with a mesh about that of window screen (1.5 mm) where each
space is occupied by a tiny fan.&nbsp; The size of the fans is a tradeoff;
if much smaller they are too easily choked by atmospheric dust, and if
much larger they generate noise and turbulence.&nbsp; (As it is they are
operating at a very low Reynolds number, and thus can likely avoid creating
turbulence; on the other hand they have increased viscous drag and thus
consume a bit more power.)&nbsp; Note that although MEMS technology could
build the fans today, no existing technology could provide the motors.
<center><img src="http://autogeny.org/aircar/lltol.gif" height="480" width="640"></center>

<center><i>Taking off.&nbsp; The blue "skirt" is the fancloth.</i></center>

<h4>
Safety, Maintenance, Etc.</h4>
It may not be generally known, but current computer hardware and software
is capable of driving an automobile from coast to coast (e.g. CMU's "No
Hands Across America").&nbsp; Autopilots capable of flying the aircar with
only indirect control from a human operator are eminently reasonable to
expect within the next decade.&nbsp; More problematical is the problem
of airspace congestion should the aircar become popular.&nbsp; Considerable
work is needed in automatic distributed air traffic control; if the political
obstacles can be overcome, the technical ones do not seem insurmountable.
<br>The final aspect of the aircar that I addressed was the subject of
self-repair and self-maintenance.&nbsp; These are closely related to the
subject of self-replicating and -extending machines, which is the core
of my ongoing research agenda. (Pages on this will be forthcoming at a
later date).

allows building on more idiomatic Unity patterns, it can also be more
challenging for a newcomer to pick these up. This is especially true because the
Input System leans on configurable assets and emphasizes Editor usage. The Input

with a static <code>current</code> member returning the device if connected<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. See the
documentation for
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Gamepad.html"><code>UnityEngine.InputSystem.Gamepad</code>, for example</a>.</p><p>Each Input Device exposes a number of Controls. These all implement the
<strong><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputControl-1.html"><code>InputControl&lt;T&gt;</code></a></strong>
class. Significantly, <code>InputControl&lt;T&gt;</code> exposes <strong><code>T ReadValue()</code></strong> which
returns the current value. This can be repeatedly called in <code>Update()</code> or
<code>FixedUpdate()</code> to respond to input.</p><p>Most buttons (Gamepad buttons, Mouse clicks, Keyboard keys) eventually inherit
<strong><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Controls.ButtonControl.html"><code>ButtonControl</code></a></strong>,
which also introduces useful properties such as <code>isPressed</code>,
<code>wasPressedThisFrame</code>, and <code>wasReleasedThisFrame</code>. A <code>ButtonControl</code> eventually
inherits from <code>InputControl&lt;float&gt;</code>. On digital devices, controls can have a
value of either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, but on analog- or pressure-sensitive devices, this
can smoothly vary between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</p><p>Other controls, like <code>DpadControl</code> and <code>StickControl</code> eventually inherit from
<strong><code>InputControl&lt;Vector2&gt;</code></strong>, which gives us the combined player input in 2D
space.</p><p>You can define a <em>composite</em> <code>Vector2</code> control using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Composites.Vector2Composite.html"><code>Vector2Composite</code></a>
from <code>UnityEngine.InputSystem.Composites</code>. Doing so is helpful, for example, to
create <code>WASD</code> as a single <code>Vector2</code> composite. At that point, however, you might
as well go for the more expressive approach of using Input Actions and Input
Action Map assets, rather than the purely programmatic approach.</p><p>An advantage of programmatic handling of input is that you can get started
quickly. The moment you want to make controls player-configurable or handle
multiple devices, this code becomes unwieldy.</p><h2>Input Actions</h2><p>Last week, I warned against the
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices#keep-it-in-code">impulse of keeping everything in code</a>,
when the editor is at your disposal. With a basic understanding of the
fundamentals from the code above, I recommend using the higher-level concept of
<em>“Input Actions”</em>.</p><figure><p><span>

<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/Components.html#notification-behaviors"><em>behaviors</em></a>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Send Messages</strong>: For each Input Action that actuates, calls
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SendMessage.html"><code>SendMessage</code></a>
on the Game Object, with the action name (e.g., <code>OnFire</code>, <code>OnLook</code>, <code>OnMove</code>)
and an
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputValue.html"><code>InputValue</code></a>.</p><p> An <code>InputValue</code> exposes boolean property <code>isPressed</code>, and the generic
<code>TValue Get&lt;TValue&gt;()</code> method. You will need to make sure the generic type
you pass is the same as the <em>Action Type</em> in the Input Action Map.</p><p> I alluded to Unity Messages in the
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#component">section on Components</a>
in this series. We already saw message functions such as <code>Update()</code>,
<code>OnEnable()</code>, and others. Here, the component calls messages that any other
component in this GameObject can implement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Broadcast Messages</strong>: The exact behavior discussed above, but using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Component.BroadcastMessage.html"><code>BroadcastMessage</code></a>
instead.</p><p> All <code>MonoBehaviour</code>s receive a broadcasted message on the GameObject <em>or any
of its child objects</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invoke Unity Events</strong>: Exposes a <code>UnityEvent&lt;InputAction.CallbackContext&gt;</code>
for each action in the asset.
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityEvents.html">UnityEvents</a> have a
friendly API <em>and</em> Editor interface and allow you to specify the exact set of
methods to trigger during an action.</p><p> <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputAction.CallbackContext.html"><code>InputAction.CallbackContext</code></a>
is also richer than <code>InputValue</code>, exposing the corresponding InputAction.
Further details such as whether the event corresponds to an action that was
<code>canceled</code> (e.g., a button that was released), <code>performed</code>, or <code>started</code>
(e.g., a button that was just pressed). Like <code>InputValue</code>, the Callback
Context exposes a method to read its value: <code>TValue ReadValue&lt;TValue&gt;()</code>.</p><p> A Unity Event is triggered every time an action is <em>started</em>, <em>performed</em>,
and <em>canceled</em>. While an InputAction is <em>actuated</em>, it will trigger a
<em>performed</em> event each time the underlying value changes.</p><p> An action such as a digital button will typically fire a single <em>started</em>,
<em>performed</em>, and <em>canceled</em> event. Holding a button for 5 seconds, for
example, would merely delay the <em>canceled</em> event.</p><p> On the other hand, a more variable value, such as a gamepad stick <code>Vector2</code>
value or a Mouse delta <code>Vector2</code>, would trigger a <em>started</em>, typically
followed by many <em>performed</em> events, and finally, a <em>canceled</em> event.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invoke C# Events</strong>: Exposes an <code>onActionTriggered</code>
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/event">C# Event</a>
on the component which similarly triggers an <code>InputAction.CallbackContext</code>,
as described above.</p><p> Unlike Unity Events, C# events cannot be modified from the editor.
Therefore, components that want to subscribe to an event will need to
reference the PlayerAction component to subscribe to the event. To avoid
leaking memory, you should always remember to subscribe in <code>OnEnable</code> and
unsubscribe in <code>OnDisable</code>.</p><p> Also, unlike Unity Events, there is only a single <code>onActionTriggered</code> event
that will trigger the callback for any action that takes place. This means
your callback should switch/condition on the Callback Context’s <code>action</code>
property.</p></li></ol><h3>Using Unity Events</h3><p>I usually prefer using Unity Events with the Input System for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>I find the <code>InputAction.CallbackContext</code> API more helpful than <code>InputValue</code>;</li><li>In <code>SendMessage</code> and <code>BroadcastMessage</code>, a typo in the message name fails
silently, resulting in a method that never gets called;</li><li>Compared to C# events, I find it helpful to visually separate the handlers
for each action, not only across methods in the same component …</li></ul></div></div>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on October 17, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's blog post is about creating a command line tool that
generates passwords for the 1987 game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_(video_game)">Metroid</a>.</p>
<p>In Metroid, you are a bounty hunter that has been contracted to recover
stolen bioweapons -- the "Metroids" -- from a group of aliens called the
"Space Pirates".</p>
<p>Metroid was notable at the time for being one of the first games with a
female protagonist.</p>
<p>The North American release of Metroid uses a password system instead of
allowing you to save your progress to the cartridge.
This was done because the ROM cartridges used by games for the Nintendo
Entertainment System (NES) could not save game progress without using
additional memory cards, which would increase the manufacturing cost.</p>
<p>Metroid's password system encodes the game state into a 144-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a>
password, represented as a 24-character string, which uses a custom
64-letter alphabet.
The password system is documented in <a href="http://resume.technoplaza.net/">John David
Ratliff's</a> <a href="http://games.technoplaza.net/mpg/password.txt">"Metroid
Password Format Guide"</a>.</p>
<p>I created this tool so that I could generate custom passwords that
allowed me to create various challenges for myself. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting the game with all powers unlocked.</li>
<li>Starting the game in a random location.</li>
<li>Starting the game with some powers permanently locked and
inaccessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this week's post, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Basic_operations">set operations</a> to combine different password features.</li>
<li>How to also use set operations to check that data constraints are not
violated.</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation">bitwise arithmetic</a> to encode the password.</li>
</ul>

<p>I implemented the special method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__or__">__or__</a> (which calls the <code>combine</code>
method) because this gives me access to the <code>|</code> operator and allows me to
write</p>

<pre><code>x = x.combine(y)

<p><code>pp_location</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> that maps location names (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">str</a> objects) to
<code>PartialPassword</code> objects. I determined the ON and OFF bits by referencing the
<a href="http://games.technoplaza.net/mpg/password.txt">Metroid Password Guide</a>. (See section 4.5, "Known Password Bits".)</p>
<p><code>pp_missiles</code> creates a <code>PartialPassword</code> object that represents the number of

<p>The formula <code>((0b1 &lt;&lt; i) &amp; n) &gt;&gt; i</code> extracts 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex">int</a> <code>n</code> at

This is important to be able to develop applications on a local machine and have them run as expected in a deployed environment. It's also important for developers to be able to run applications as expected on any computer to get up and running quickly and collaborate with other developers no matter how they've configured their computer.</p><p>The reason why running applications on different machines is so difficult is that all the right versions of an application's dependencies must be installed for it to run as expected. For example, if trying to run an API that is built with Node.js, and it was developed and tested on a machine using Node.js 12.8, it might not necessarily run the same on a machine that has Node.js version 10.18 installed. The same goes for any other dependency used in applications, such as python, ruby, php, typescript, nginx, apache, mysql, postgres, etc. Docker makes it possible to build containerized applications that hold the right versions of all dependencies and can run as intended on different machines.</p><p>Docker has 4 types of "objects" it uses to be able to create these isolated environments: <strong>images</strong>, <strong>containers</strong>, <strong>volumes</strong>, and <strong>networks</strong>. The two objects users will most often be directly working with are Docker <strong>images</strong> and Docker <strong>containers</strong>.</p><p><span>

A Docker <em>image</em> can be thought of as the blueprints and code used by a Docker <em>container</em>. Docker images can be saved to image registries for others to download the images. The most popular Docker image registry is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Hub</a>. You can think of image registries as the NPM equivalent for Docker images.</p><p>Read more about Docker images and containers in the <em><a href="#docker-images">Docker images</a></em> and <em><a href="#docker-containers">Docker containers</a></em> sections of the guide, respectively.</p><p><strong>Docker volumes</strong> are used to persist data that is generated by running Docker containers. By saving data to a Docker volume, it will permit an application to have the same data even if the Docker container has been removed, recreated, or restarted. Docker volumes are also useful if two different containers should have access to the same data since both containers can point to the same volume.</p><p><strong>Docker networks</strong> are used to make sure containers are isolated from each other and are also used to allow containers to communicate with each other.</p><p>Read more about Docker volumes and networks in the <em><a href="#docker-volumes">Docker volumes</a></em> and <em><a href="#docker-networks">Docker networks</a></em> sections of the guide, respectively.</p><div><p>Resources 📝</p><p>Related resources</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>"Docker Overview"</em></a> from the official Docker documentation</li></ul></div><h2 id="what-about-virtual-machines"><a href="#what-about-virtual-machines" aria-label="what about virtual machines permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" strokelinecap="round" strokelinejoin="round"><line x1="4" y1="9" x2="20" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" y1="15" x2="20" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" y1="3" x2="8" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" y1="3" x2="14" y2="21"></line></svg></a>What about virtual machines?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual machines</a> (VMs) often come up in the same conversation as Docker since they are both be used to create isolated environments.</p><p>With Docker, applications run in isolated environments called containers and each one of these containers share the same operating system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kernel</a> on a machine.

Docker handles this for you if you install the Docker Desktop app for Mac OS or Windows, which ships with <a href="https://github.com/Linuxkit/Linuxkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinuxKit</a>: a lightweight Linux kernel that runs on Mac OS or Windows operating systems and is used by the Docker engine. The lightweight Linux kernel sits on a hypervisor that ships natively with Windows (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/41556921/8360496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference</a>) and Mac OS (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55085366/8360496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference</a>).</p><p><img src="https://www.robertcooper.me/images/docker-on-Linux-windows-mac.jpg" alt="Docker hardware and software breakdown on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows OS"></p></div><p>The advantages of using Docker over virtual machines overwhelmingly tip the scales in favor of using Docker. Compared to virtual machines, Docker containers can get up in running within seconds compared to minutes, are lightweight (magnitude of MBs compared to GBs), are easily configurable, and use a small amount of resources. Perhaps the only reason to use a virtual machine over docker is if a high level of isolation is desired because of concerns about security vulnerabilities associated with having Docker containers using a shared kernel on the host operating system.</p><h2 id="docker-engine"><a href="#docker-engine" aria-label="docker engine permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" strokelinecap="round" strokelinejoin="round"><line x1="4" y1="9" x2="20" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" y1="15" x2="20" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" y1="3" x2="8" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" y1="3" x2="14" y2="21"></line></svg></a>Docker engine</h2><p>The Docker engine needs to be installed and running on any machine that wants to do anything related to Docker. Starting the engine means that a long-running background process (the Docker daemon which also corresponds with the <code>dockerd</code> command) gets started to create a server that can be interacted with via a REST API. The Docker CLI is the way most people interact with the REST API to manage Docker objects, but 3rd party apps are also able to interact <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly with the REST API</a> or via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker engine SDKs</a>.</p><p><span>

The file generally begins by specifying a base image that will be used as the basis of the Docker image to be built. For example, if building a python based API, a base image that is made up of a Linux OS with python installed on it can be used. After specifying a base image, other instructions are used that can specify the following details on how to the Docker image should be built:</p><ul><li>Environment variables to set in a container</li><li>Ports exposed by the image</li><li>Which files should be copied into the image</li><li>Which dependencies should be installed</li><li>Command to be executed when starting a container (e.g. <code>yarn start</code> if starting a Node.js API)</li><li>And more...</li></ul><p>As an example, an image for a Node.js API might have a <code>Dockerfile</code> similar to the following:</p><div><p>Dockerfile</p><div><pre data-language="Dockerfile"><p><span>1</span><span># Base image that has Node version 12.16.1 installed on a Linux OS.</span></p><p><span>2</span><span># This is an alpine Linux image that is smaller than the non-alpine Linux equivalent images.</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>FROM node:12.16.1-alpine3.11</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span># Installs some dependencies required for the Node.js API</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>RUN apk add --no-cache make g++</span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span># Indicates that the API exposes port 3000</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>EXPOSE 3000</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span># Specifies the working directory.

								and Cool Plex, which looked a lot of meta-code and what I now know to be <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7839826">RDF Triples</a>
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>At my new job, I was writing web-facing applications using open source technology and deploying to Linux.  I needed to find an editor to help me with the task.</p>
					<p>I spent a bit of time exploring my options.  During that exploration, I learned of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> from <a href="https://www.oddbird.net/authors/carl/">Carl Meyer</a>.<span><ins role="note">
								Carl is a friend of mine from high school, and has contributed a lot to the world.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>At the time I had three young children, I had just changed jobs, changed programming languages, and couldn’t wrap my head around Emacs.  I wanted my editor to behave like other <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Graphical User Interface" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GUI">↑</a></sup>
						applications.</p>
					<p>I didn’t take the time to walk through the Emacs tutorial, and left Emacs behind.</p>
					<p>A few months into my new job, I switched languages and paradigms again.  In <time datetime="2005-12-03">December 2005</time>, my company hopped in a van and drove to Chicago to learn about <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q842014" title="Django: Python Web Framework">Django</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Django: Python Web Framework" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-DJANGO">↑</a></sup>
						and <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190478" title="Ruby on Rails: Open Source Web Application Framework">Ruby on Rails</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Ruby on Rails: Open Source Web Application Framework" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ROR">↑</a></sup>
						.  Within a week, our organization adopted Ruby on Rails.</p>
					<p>At that time, I adopted <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2297533" title="Textmate">Textmate</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Textmate" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-TEXTMATE">↑</a></sup>
						as my editor.  It had a beautiful user-interface and required little effort to learn.<span><ins role="note">
								I wasn’t aware of how useful a shell environment could be; In the years I’d learn more.  I had, during my professional life, often relied on GUI views into files, systems, and processes.  So I didn’t have a mental model that would have further nudged me towards an integrated text editor.  And in my hubris, I didn’t step through the Emacs tutorial.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>At the time Textmate was closed source. I used it and loved it, but it began to lag.<span><ins role="note">
								The search a project function started misbehaving and gridning projects to a halt.
							</ins></span>
						I found <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q267193" title="Sublime Text: A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose">Sublime Text</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Sublime Text: A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-SUBLIME">↑</a></sup>
						and switched.  At the time, Sublime was positioning as a Textmate replacement.</p>
					<p>Then, as I engaged more and more in open source projects, I started wanting an open source text editor.  I learned about Atom in 2015.  It was open source and acted enough like Sublime, that I switched.<span><ins role="note">
								During this time, I dabbled with <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131382" title="Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor">vim</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VIM">↑</a></sup>
								.  However, the modal nature of editing felt foreign.  At times, I’d try out a tutorial, but it never stuck.  I also thought about revising Textmate as the owner later released it as open source.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Forward to <time datetime="2020-03">earlier this year</time>.  I had begun noticing more and more bugs and breaks in Atom.  Not one to fear changing editors, I started looking.</p>
					<p>I also gave <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19841877" title="Visual Studio Code">VS Code</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Visual Studio Code" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VSC">↑</a></sup>
						a spin, and found it disconcerting.  First, it felt constraining and off-putting. The configuration ecosystem felt clunky. The plugins felt like an App Store. Everything felt like VS Code was trying to obfuscate it’s underlying systems.</p>
					
					<p>The proverbial last straw was the <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186055" title="Git: Free and open source revision control software">git</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Git: Free and open source revision control software" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GIT">↑</a></sup>
						prompt for commit messages.  The prompt was a small input box; It didn’t encourage meaningful commit messages. Instead it encouraged terse commits. That feature alone told me that people using it will be encouraged to write bad commit messages. I didn’t want to be that guy with my text editor.</p>
					<p>So, I spent a bit of time again testing <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131382" title="Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor">vim</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VIM">↑</a></sup>
						and Emacs.</p>
					<p>I again tried <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131382" title="Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor">vim</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VIM">↑</a></sup>
						but it felt off.<span><ins role="note">
								I use Vim when I shell out to a server.  I haven’t done it much recently, because I’d likely use Emacs’s <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">Tramp mode</a>.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>I tried Emacs, and worked my way through the Tutorial.  It was the strong commitment to the Tutorial and honestly the writing of that tutorial that nudged me to dive further in.  I spent some time fiddling with Doom or Spacemacs, but in the end settled on bare metal Emacs.</p>
					<p>This proved crucial.  As someone that’s used text editors for 15+ years, I know the features I’ve used. What I chose to do in Emacs was to complete the tutorial and start coding.</p>
					<p>If I found myself wanting a feature, I took note of it.  Then, I went and found the package or packages that implemented the feature.<span><ins role="note">
								I spent quite a bit of time reading through <a href="https://melpa.org/">Melpa</a>, looking for a package. What happened is that I have built up my own editor that meets my needs.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Now, 5 months or so in, I’m fully loving the experience. The community of Emacs developers seem to have a higher commitment to writing documentation.<span><ins role="note">
								Many Emacs developers write their configuration files using the paradigm of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q607703">Literate Programming</a>.  In other words, they first write down their intentions for the software, then write the software.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<h2 id="org-mode">Org Mode</h2>
					<p><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> is the missing piece for my past text editors. <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93149769">Carstin Dominik</a> took the time to build out functionality for organizing the non-coding tasks of software development, research, and writing.<span><ins role="note">
								Were I to begin my blog anew, I’d leverage <code>org-mode</code> and <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> for blogging.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Org Mode layers meaningful tools on top of plain text files; The syntax is close to Markdown, but different enough. The simplicity of structure makes the world of difference. With the plain text, I can run low-level Unix commands (e.g. <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, etc.) but also have higher level programmatic access to the data.</p>
					<h2 id="magit">Magit</h2>
					<p>Prior to <a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a>, I almost always used command line tools for <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186055" title="Git: Free and open source revision control software">git</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Git: Free and open source revision control software" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GIT">↑</a></sup>
						. My previous workflow would be to use Terminal to state my git commits, and then my text editor to write commit messages.<span><ins role="note">
								Atom’s slowness to open as a commit message editor was another reason I left Atom.  I don’t want to wait multiple seconds to start writing a commit message.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Except for reading git logs, I now do most all git tasks with Magit.  That includes an <strong>amazing</strong> interactive <code>git rebase</code> environment.</p>
					<h2 id="fill-paragraph">Fill Paragraph</h2>
					<p>I must mention this lowly command.</p>
					<p>When Carl introduced me to Emacs, he showed me <code>fill-paragraph</code>. That functionality stuck with me. It’s nothing fancy, but it shows that Emacs treats column-width as a first class citizen.</p>
					<p>And why is column width important?  First, <a href="https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">re-read the note about commit message</a>.</p>
					<p>Conforming to that structure helps ensure that your <code>git log</code> excursions are not unduly messy.  It also helps if you’re going to interact with the command-line.  In other words, automatic word-wrapping is nice, but its not universal, nor does it work in all contexts.</p>
					<p>I have used this command to quickly wrap documentation so as to not have it flow off the screen.<span><ins role="note">
								For coding buffers, I disable word wrapping.  I also aspire to 120 character line width for code and 80 character line width for comments.  Why the variance?  Comments should read more like prose, and long running lines make the paragraphs harder to read.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>It ain’t much of a command, but I’ve held a candle for it since I learned about Emacs.</p>
					<h2 id="swiper">Swiper</h2>
					<p>I never knew I wanted Swiper until I stumbled onto it.  I now use it <em>all of the time</em>; It’s even replaced my default Find behavior in Emacs.</p>
					<p>What does it do? I type Control+S<span><ins role="note">
								In Emacs parlance, that’s <code>C-s</code>
							</ins></span>
						and start typing a word.  In a mini-buffer at the bottom of the current buffer, I see the lines that include that word.  It’s a bit like a find with context.  Importantly, this doesn’t move my cursor in the main buffer.</p>
					<p>So I end up quickly referencing something and get back to typing.  Or, I can navigate through the mini-buffer and jump to that location in the main buffer.  Quite slick.</p>
					<h2 id="wgrep-ag">WGrep-Ag</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep/blob/master/wgrep-ag.el">wgrep-ag</a> package sort of blew my mind. It allows you to use <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher" title="The Silver Search (ag)">ag</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of The Silver Search (ag)" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-AG">↑</a></sup>
						with <a href="https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep">wgrep</a> to edit search results</p>
					<p>Follow along carefully:</p>
					<p>In Emacs, I search a project using <code>ag</code>.  Emacs renders the search results in a mini-buffer. In this case, the mini-buffer is a small set of rows at the bottom of Emacs that show a subset of the results.</p>
					<p>With the mini-buffer active (e.g. I’ve been typing results there), I invoke <code>ivy-occur</code>.  That function opens all of the search results in a read-only buffer.<span><ins role="note">
								While I was writing this example, I thought to myself “I wonder if I can use <code>ivy-occur</code> from Swiper results?  Yes I can.  So I learned something while explaining something.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>With this new buffer, I invoke the function <code>wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode</code>.  This toggles <code>ivy-occur</code> buffer into an edit mode.  I begin editing the search results as though it were it’s own file.</p>
					<p>Then I save the edits, and <code>wgrep-ag</code> writes all of those changes back to the found results.</p>
					<p>Another way to think of it, <code>wgrep-ag</code> loads a semi-structured buffer. Each row has three fields: file name, line number, and line text.  I can use <code>wgrep-ag</code> to write those changes back to the originating file.</p>
					<p>Seriously, this functionality amazes me.</p>
					<h2 id="multiple-cursors">Multiple Cursors</h2>
					<p>Textmate first introduced me to this powerful concept.  Since then, this functionality has been a mandatory feature of my editors.</p>
					<p>Two packages help deliver on this:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<a href="https://github.com/victorhge/iedit">iedit</a> - by default, if I type Control+<code>;</code> (e.g. <code>C-;</code>), the iedit package highlights each occurence of the word. I can now type and iedit updates all occurrences.</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el">multiple-cursors</a> - this package provides finer grain control, and allows me to set a cursor on ten contiguous lines and start typing.</li>
					</ol>
					<h2 id="expand-region">Expand Region</h2>
					<p>I didn’t know what I was missing until I installed <a href="https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el">expand-region</a>.  Now with Control+<code>=</code> (e.g. <code>C-=</code>) my cursor  expands to the smallest logical region (e.g. highlighting a word), typing it again expands that region (e.g. highlighting the sentence), etc.  And Control+Shift+<code>=</code> (e.g. <code>C-+</code>) contracts the region.</p>
					<h2 id="org-roam">Org Roam</h2>
					<p>Building on <code>org-mode</code>, <a href="https://orgroam.com/">org roam</a> incorporates note taking paradigms inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a>.</p>

    </p>
    

    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
    Under general relativity, gravity is not a force. Instead it is a distortion of spacetime. Objects in free-fall move along geodesics (straight lines) in spacetime, as seen in the inertial frame of reference on the right. When standing on Earth we experience a frame of reference that is accelerating upwards, causing objects in free-fall to move along parabolas, as seen on the left.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this system there is only one space dimension, shown on the vertical axis and labeled in meters. The time dimension is the horizontal axis and labeled in seconds. The gravitational field is constant within the area of interest. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the first slider to change the acceleration of the frame of reference in the middle. When the frame has zero acceleration it is said to be an inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the second slider to move the time window. Note that all the trajectories remain as straight lines in the inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can drag the start and end position of each object to change their trajectories. All free-fall trajectories in the inertial frame of reference are straight lines.

<h2 id="rule-110">Rule 110</h2>
<p>After reading Chris Penner's blog post on <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/conways-game-of-life">Conway's Game Of Life Using Representable and Comonads</a>, I decided to implement a similar solution for the 1 dimensional automata <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110</a>. Being such a simple algorithm I thought the implementation would be trivial. However, it turns out that working with arbitarily bounded spaces in the <code>Store Comonad</code> requires a clever use of dependent types to apply memoizaition as described in Chris' blog.</p>
<p>This blog post walks through my experience attempting to use <code>Store</code>, <code>Representable</code> in Haskell to implement Rule 110, difficulty finding a suitable <code>Representable</code> instance, and then a pivot to Idris where I was able to solve the problem using the finite set type <code>Fin n</code>.</p>
<p>The Rule 110 algorithm takes a vector of boolean values and applies a simple set of rules for transforming each index based upon its neighbors. You can think of it as a 1 dimensional variant of Conway's Game of Life, but with the twist that the first and last element of the vector are considered neighbors. In other words, the automata in Rule 110 exists on a circle rather then a line segment.</p>
<p>Here is the rubric for generating the new state for a given element:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Current Pattern</td>
<td>111</td>
<td>110</td>
<td>101</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>011</td>
<td>010</td>
<td>001</td>
<td>000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New State</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This post assumes no prior knowledge of Comonads, Representable Functors, <code>Fin n</code>. The first few sections are intended to introduce these concepts by focusing on the actual implementations of their APIs.</p>
<h2 id="the-store-type-and-its-api">The Store Type and its API</h2>
<p>The <code>Store</code> type can be thought of as a way to query some indexable state along with a cursor that queries into the store at some index.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> a) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>State is held implicitly in your query function and, as we shall see later, can be transformed through composition.</p>
<p>As an example, we can construct a <code>Store</code> whose implicit state is an infinite list of Booleans which we index into with an Integer:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>initialStore ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>initialStore <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span>      query ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>      query i <span>=</span> (<span>cycle</span> [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>]) <span>!!</span> <span>abs</span> i</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Store</code> API then allows us to do things like query arbitrary indices, shift around our cursor, and through its <code>Functor</code> and <code>Comonad</code> instances to perform transformations on the implicit state held inside the query function.</p>
<p>Lets walk through the implementation of this API to gain a better intuition.</p>
<p>First we need a getter to lookup the current index:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>pos ::</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> s</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>pos (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we want a way to query the <code>Store</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>peek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>peek s (<span>Store</span> query _) <span>=</span> query s</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>peeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a>peeks f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> query (f s)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>peek</code> disregards the current cursor and instead applies a new cursor to the store's query function. <code>peeks</code> uses a function <code>s -&gt;
  s</code> to modify the current cursor and then query the store with the new cursor.</p>
<p>We would also like a way to set and shift our cursor index:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>seek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>seek s (<span>Store</span> query _) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query s</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span>seeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>seeks f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query (f s)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This covers are basic getters and setters, but what if we wanted a way to query multiple indices into our store?</p>
<p>We might write this function:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>peekMany ::</span> [s] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>peekMany xs store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (<span>flip</span> peek store) xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function looks pretty good, but notice we are using <code>fmap</code>. We can take advantage of polymorphism here allow use use of any <code>Functor</code>:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>peekFunctor ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> f s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>peekFunctor fs store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (<span>flip</span> peek store) fs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can use any <code>Functor</code> we want, but notice how we aren't using our cursor at all. This is a clue that we might be able to generalize this function further.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could modify <code>peekFunctor</code> to use our cursor value without losing the current behavior of the function.</p>
<p>If we replace the <code>f s</code> parameter with a function <code>s -&gt; f s</code> then we could apply the current cursor to our function and generate an <code>f
  s</code> to generate our <code>f a</code> output. Then if we want the precise behavior of <code>peekFunctor</code> we can simply apply <code>const (x :: f s)</code> and ignore the current cursor!</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>experiment ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> f s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>experiment f store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (<span>flip</span> peek store) (f (pos store))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To recap our <code>Store</code> API we have:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>pos ::</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>peek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a><span>peeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a><span>seek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span>seeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a><span>experiment ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> f s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="transformation-of-state">Transformation of State</h2>
<p>The state of the system is stored implicitely inside the <code>s -&gt; a</code> query function rather then in some data structure. Because of this, the only way to modify the state would be to modify the query function itself.</p>
<p>We can do this by first querying the current store to get an <code>a</code> value and then apply some <code>a -&gt; b</code> function to the value to produce a modified version of the state at that index.</p>
<p>We can do this by pattern matching on our <code>Store</code> then composing an <code>a -&gt; b</code> function with our query function:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>updateStoreState ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>updateStoreState f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (f <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>updateStoreState</code> allows you to modify the query result for all possible values inside the Store's implicit state. This signature shoud look familiar as it is <code>fmap</code> and <code>Store</code> is in fact a <code>Functor</code>.</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> (<span>Store</span> s) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a><span>    fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>    <span>fmap</span> f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (f <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can model successive transformations of the state through applications of <code>fmap</code>. For example, using the <code>Store Int Bool</code> example from earlier, we might want to apply <code>not :: Bool -&gt; Bool</code> to invert the state of our system:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>initialStore ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>initialStore <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>    <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4"><a href="#cb12-4"></a>      query i <span>=</span> (<span>cycle</span> [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>]) <span>!!</span> i</span>
<span id="cb12-5"><a href="#cb12-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb12-6"><a href="#cb12-6"></a><span>newState ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb12-7"><a href="#cb12-7"></a>newState <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>not</span> initialStore</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using equational reasoning we can translate that into:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a>newState <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>not</span> initialStore</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>         <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>not</span> (<span>Store</span> query s)</span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>         <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (<span>not</span> <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using this technique to model 3 manipulations of a system shows how each modification to the implicit state builds up a larger composed query function:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>newState ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-&gt;</span> (c <span>-&gt;</span> d) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>newState h g f store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>fmap</span> g (<span>fmap</span> h store))</span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>fmap</span> g (<span>fmap</span> h (<span>Store</span> query s)))</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><a href="#cb14-4"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>fmap</span> g (<span>Store</span> (h <span>.</span> query) s))</span>
<span id="cb14-5"><a href="#cb14-5"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>Store</span> (g <span>.</span> h <span>.</span> query) s)</span>
<span id="cb14-6"><a href="#cb14-6"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (f <span>.</span> g <span>.</span> h <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>While elegant, modeling state transformations as function composition means that every time we query an index in a <code>Store</code>, we must recalculate every single previous transformation going back to the original <code>Store</code> query. Without caching these intermediate computations this will get very expensive.</p>
<p>Luckily, Chris Penner showed us a fantastic solution for this using Representable Functors. We will look at <code>Representable</code> shortly, but for now lets ignore the performance issue and focus on the tools we need to naively implement Rule 110.</p>

<p>Not only is <code>Store</code> a <code>Functor</code>, it is also a <code>Comonad</code>.</p>
<p><code>Comonads</code> are the dual of <code>Monads</code>. Where <code>Monads</code> introduce some effect to an argument via the form <code>a -&gt; m b</code>, <code>Comonads</code> introduce a notion of querying a structure for data (co-effects):</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1"></a><span>-- Monadic</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2"></a>a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="#cb15-3"></a><span>repeat</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb15-4"><a href="#cb15-4"></a><span>-- Comonadic</span></span>
<span id="cb15-5"><a href="#cb15-5"></a>w a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb15-6"><a href="#cb15-6"></a><span>length</span><span> ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Comonad</code> Typeclass has three functions:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1"></a><span>class</span> <span>Functor</span> w <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Comonad</span> w <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2"></a><span>    extract   ::</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3"></a><span>    duplicate ::</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> w (w a)</span>
<span id="cb16-4"><a href="#cb16-4"></a><span>    extend    ::</span> (w a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> w b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice the inverse relation to <code>return</code>, <code>join</code>, and <code>(=&lt;&lt;)</code> from <code>Monad</code>:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1"></a><span>extract ::</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2"></a><span>return</span><span>  ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb17-3"><a href="#cb17-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-4"><a href="#cb17-4"></a><span>duplicate ::</span> w a     <span>-&gt;</span> w (w a)</span>
<span id="cb17-5"><a href="#cb17-5"></a><span>join      ::</span> m (m a) <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb17-6"><a href="#cb17-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-7"><a href="#cb17-7"></a><span>extend ::</span> (w a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> w b</span>
<span id="cb17-8"><a href="#cb17-8"></a><span>(=&lt;&lt;)  ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m b) <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If a defining characteristic of <code>Comonads</code> in Haskell is to provide a mechanism for querying some structure for data, then we can almost definitionally say that <code>Store</code> is a <code>Comonad</code>. <code>Store</code> is literally a mechnanism for querying a structure to produce data!</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>Comonad</span> (<span>Store</span> s) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb18-2"><a href="#cb18-2"></a><span>    extract ::</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb18-3"><a href="#cb18-3"></a>    extract (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> query s</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><a href="#cb18-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><a href="#cb18-5"></a><span>    extend ::</span> (<span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb18-6"><a href="#cb18-6"></a>    extend f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (\s' <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Store</span> query s')) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>extract</code> applies the current cursor to the query function and <code>extend</code> chains state transforming queries.</p>
<p><code>extract</code> is fairly trivial in this case, but <code>extend</code> is a little trickier. It helps to think about in relation to our <code>fmap</code> implementation.</p>
<p>Like <code>fmap</code>, it uses a function to modify our implicit state, but where <code>fmap</code> composed a pure <code>a -&gt; b</code> function with our query, <code>extend</code> creates a new query function by applying your entire store to a comonadic action. This allows us to bring into scope the entire current store when modifying particular points in the store.</p>
<p><code>extend</code> is extremely powerful and allows us to do really interesting things like create windowing functions and perform kernel convolution. It allows us to modify every single individual points in "parallel" using the entire state as context.</p>
<p>One interesting example of extend is to perform a moving average on some time series data.</p>
<p>First we need a <code>Store</code> modeling time sequenced data. We will use <code>Int</code> for our Index and it will represent a single unit of time in a data stream. We want some fairly dynamic data source so I chose the Fibbonaci sequence. At each point in time (each index) we get the next Fibbonaci number.</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1"></a><span>fibStore ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2"><a href="#cb19-2"></a>fibStore <span>=</span> store query <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3"><a href="#cb19-3"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4"><a href="#cb19-4"></a><span>    query ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb19-5"><a href="#cb19-5"></a>    query <span>0</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb19-6"><a href="#cb19-6"></a>    query <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb19-7"><a href="#cb19-7"></a>    query n <span>=</span> query (n <span>-</span> <span>1</span>) <span>+</span> query (n <span>-</span> <span>2</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, if we want to calculate a window starting from a given cursor want some way to query for the subsequent points in time. <code>experiement</code> will work perfectly here:</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1"></a><span>window ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2"></a>window store <span>=</span> experiment (\s <span>-&gt;</span> [s<span>..</span>s<span>+</span><span>10</span>]) store</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I chose to fix the window at 10 units of time arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Now notice the shape of <code>window</code> is <code>Store Int a -&gt; [a]</code>. That looks a lot like the comonadic …</p></div>

October 18, 2020 | https://lucas-le-ray.com/blog/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lucas-le-ray.com/blog/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everyday I spend 30m checking stats from this blog, that’s <strong>180 hours</strong> a year !</p>
<p>These stats are useful to know if my articles are relevant (if you quit now I’ll know it and be very sad… 👉👈).<br>
But getting these stats is too long, I have to use Google Analytics, Stripe, my database, etc...<br>
The good news is that I know how to get this data automatically, and I’ll teach you how, with a <strong>Slack Bot</strong> 🤖.</p>
<p>More precisely, we’re going to build a bot that tells me the money on my Stripe account. This money comes from the donations you make to me through <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">Buy Me A Coffee</a> at the bottom right of the page. We will use Node.JS, Slack API and Stripe API !</p>
<p>You can get the final code <a href="https://github.com/LucasLeRay/stripe_balance_slackbot">on GitHub</a> or you can copy my <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/join/4d7ef406-2714-41de-bd2f-216561bd452b">Glitch project</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a Slack Application</li>
<li>Coding a Slack Bot using Bolt.Js</li>
<li>Registering to Slack Events</li>
<li>Admiring the result !  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Creating a Slack Application</h2>
<p>To build a Slack Bot, we’ll need to <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1">create a Slack App</a>.
We have to choose a name and the workspace to install it:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/2.png" alt="Create a Slack App">
then we add permissions so that Slack knows what it has to allows us to do</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>app_mentions:read</strong>: allow to read messages that mention the app.</li>
<li><strong>chat</strong>:write: allow to write messages.</li>
<li><strong>im:history</strong>: allow to read direct messages to the app.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of permissions is available <a href="https://api.slack.com/scopes">in the scope section</a>.
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/3.png" alt="Slack App permissions">
Now we can install the app to our Slack Workspace !
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/4.png" alt="Install a Slack App to a Workspace">
As a bonus, we can customize the app's name, description, color and icon:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/5.png" alt="Customize a Slack App"></p>
<hr>
<h2>Coding a Slack Bot using Bolt.Js</h2>
<p>Now that we've created our bot, we can code its behaviors. We’re going to use Bolt.JS (the official framework to build Slack Apps) and Node.Js.
To begin with, <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/join/4d7ef406-2714-41de-bd2f-216561bd452b">clone my project from Glitch</a>.
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/6.png" alt="Code a Slack Bot with Bolt.Js">
Glitch allows us to code our bot and make its code live. That’ll be useful to test the bot without deploying it on a server (you can also use <a href="https://ngrok.com/">Ngrok</a>).
To make this code work, we need our Slack API keys.</p>
<p>We have <code>SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET</code> in the <strong>Basic Information</strong> section:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/7.png" alt="Slack signing secret">
And <code>SLACK_BOT_TOKEN</code> in <strong>Install App</strong>:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/8.png" alt="Slack bot token">
We also need the <strong>Stripe Secret API key</strong>, which you can find in your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard">Stripe Dashboard</a>:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/9.png" alt="Stripe secret API key">
We can now enter your API Keys in the <code>.env</code> file:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/10.png" alt="Glitch env file"></p>
<hr>
<h2>Registering to Slack Events</h2>
<p>The code in <code>index.js</code> has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure and launch the bot</li>
<li>Listen and respond to events</li>
</ul>
<p>Bot configuration is done with the following:  </p>

<p>If we try our bot now it’ll not work: We didn’t say to Slack which events we want to listen !
We can do it in the <strong>Event Subscriptions</strong> section:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/11.png" alt="Add request URL to Slack app">
We need to specify in the <strong>Request URL</strong> the HTTP address of our bot, which is <code>GLITCH_URL/slack/events</code>.<br>
In my case: <a href="https://foul-cotton-medicine.glitch.me/slack/events">https://foul-cotton-medicine.glitch.me/slack/events</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we can subscribe to 2 events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>message.im</strong>: We listen to messages posted to direct message channels</li>
<li><strong>app_mention</strong>: We ONLY listen to messages that mention our bot.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Our bot is basically saying to Slack: “<em>tell me when someone is sending me a direct message, but no other message</em>”.</p>
<p><img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-slackbot-nodejs-2020/12.png" alt="Subscribe to Slack events">
Now, let’s go to our workspace:

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Today, you built a Slack Bot that saved you minutes everyday ! Congrats ! 🎉</p>
<p>But it’s just the beginning. We only saw a bit of what you can do with a Slack Bot. Feel free to <a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts#basic">check the Bolt.Js documentation</a> to see the possibilities !</p>
<p>You’d find it useful to <a href="https://slack.dev/bolt-js/deployments/heroku">deploy your bot on Heroku</a>. Thankfully it’s as easy as it sounds, just don’t forget to update the <strong>Request URL</strong> of your event subscriptions.</p>

Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@if5: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns netns0</code></pre>
<p>Once we turn the devices on and assign proper IP addresses, any packet occurring on one of the devices will immediately pop up on its peer device connecting two namespaces. Let's start from the root namespace:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set veth0 up
$ sudo ip addr add 172.18.0.11/16 dev veth0</code></pre>
<p>And continue with the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0
$ ip link set lo up  # whoops
$ ip link set ceth0 up
$ ip addr add 172.18.0.10/16 dev ceth0
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
5: ceth0@if6: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0</code></pre>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/container-networking-is-simple/veth.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Connecting network namespaces via veth device.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We are ready to check the connectivity:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0`, ping root's veth0

<p>At the same time, if we try to reach any other addresses from the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we are not going to succeed:</p>
<pre><code># Inside root namespace
$ ip addr show dev eth0
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000

# Remember this 10.0.2.15

$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0

# Try host's eth0
$ ping 10.0.2.15
connect: Network is unreachable

# Try something from the Internet
$ ping 8.8.8.8
connect: Network is unreachable</code></pre>
<p>That's easy to explain, though. There is simply no route in the <code>netns0</code> routing table for such packets. The only entry there shows how to reach <code>172.18.0.0/16</code> network:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0` namespace:
$ ip route
172.18.0.0/16 dev ceth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.10</code></pre>
<p>Linux has a bunch of ways to populate the routing table. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is part 2 of an ongoing series about <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>. If you missed part 1:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://opensourc.es/basics-multiple-dispatch">Multiple dispatch</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is now also part 3 on <a href="https://opensourc.es/all-about-pkg">how to use the package manager</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I want show you how to use the REPL (Read-eval-print loop) and to use <a href="https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl">Revise.jl</a> which in my opinion is THE extension everyone should use!</p>
<p>If you enjoy the video format more than reading a blog: First of all: Thanks that you're here and not on YouTube/Netflix/Twitch etc :D  You might wanna have a look at this wonderful video about the REPL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkgCENBFrAY">Julia REPL tips and tricks by BrainRPG</a>.</p>
<p>That are well spent 40 minutes ;) Anyway as you're here let's continue.</p>

<h2 id="repl_first_usage"><a href="#repl_first_usage">REPL first usage</a></h2>
<p>After downloading/installing the latest version (now 1.4.2) you can just type <code>julia</code> in your REPL and get greeted like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.

 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You get some useful information right there which newcomers often miss as they are too excited to try it out. Maybe you've been there and are now reading this post to get some more tips &amp; tricks.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the different REPL modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>?</code> for help mode</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>;</code> for shell mode</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>]</code> for package mode</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can simply type one of those characters to switch to the mode.</p>
<h3 id="getting_help"><a href="#getting_help">Getting help</a></h3>
<p>After typing <code>?</code> you see:</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can get help about functions like getting their docstring using this method.</p>
<p>In the last post I talked about <code>methods</code> to see which methods are implemented for a given function.</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt; methods
search: methods methodswith Method MethodError hasmethod

  methods(f, [types], [module])

  Return the method table for f.

  If types is specified, return an array of methods whose types match. If module is specified, return an array of methods defined in that module. A list of modules can also be specified as an array.

  │ Julia 1.4
  │
  │  At least Julia 1.4 is required for specifying a module.</code></pre>
<p>The first line shows you a list of functions with a similar name which might be handy if you mistyped the function name.</p>
<p>Or if you just have a typo:</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt; metods
search: methods methodswith Method MethodError hasmethod</code></pre>
<p>This way you also sometimes learn new useful functions.</p>
<p>You have no clue what the method is called? I guess you still now what you want to do with it ;)</p>
<p>Maybe have a look at <code>apropos</code></p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; apropos("standard deviation")
Base.randn
Random.randn!
Statistics.stdm
Statistics.std</code></pre>
<p>You're probably looking for <code>Statistics.std</code>. I have to admit that often this way you get quite a long list of possibilities but it can be a reasonable method if you don't have an internet connection.</p>
<p>In the end of this post I have a list of resources you might want to check out when learning Julia :)</p>
<h3 id="shell_mode"><a href="#shell_mode">Shell mode</a></h3>
<p>The next mode in our list is the shell mode which you can enter with <code>;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>shell&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I don't actually know how well this works on Windows but it's quite useful on Linux and probably Mac.</p>
<p>You can just use your normal commands that you use in your shell like <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>pwd</code> and so on. These are only the ones I use frequently. Depending on your workflow you might wanna use <code>git</code> with that as well.</p>
<p>It is often nice to be able to do a quick command in the same directory instead of opening a new terminal for it.</p>
<p>That said you can use Julia itself for some of those commands as well:</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt; cd
search: cd Cdouble gcd gcdx secd asecd cld Cmd codeunit codeunits codepoint code_llvm code_typed code_native code_lowered code_warntype @cmd ncodeunits @code_llvm @code_typed @code_native @code_lowered

  cd(dir::AbstractString=homedir())

  Set the current working directory.</code></pre>
<h3 id="package_mode"><a href="#package_mode">Package mode</a></h3>
<p>Let's get to the last REPL mode before discussing <code>Revise</code> a bit. </p>
<p>You can add packages with this mode as well as updating/removing them. Follow me with <code>]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This mode is a little special as you see the package environment we are in. At the moment we are in the global environment. If you need different package versions in different projects/environments, you can create a new environment by using <code>activate</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; ?activate
  activate
  activate [--shared] path

  Activate the environment at the given path, or the home project environment if no path is specified. The active environment is the environment that is modified by executing package commands. When
  the option --shared is given, path will be assumed to be a directory name and searched for in the environments folders of the depots in the depot stack. In case no such environment exists in any of
  the depots, it will be placed in the first depot of the stack.</code></pre>
<p>i.e if I want to add a dependency to my <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/ConstraintSolver.jl">ConstraintSolver</a> I would write</p>
<pre><code>]
(@v1.4) pkg&gt; activate /home/ole/Julia/ConstraintSolver
Activating environment at `~/Julia/ConstraintSolver/Project.toml`

(ConstraintSolver) pkg&gt;</code></pre>
<p>but that might be needed in your first steps so don't worry about that now :)</p>
<p>Instead let's install <a href="https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl">Revise.jl</a> as I mentioned it's THE package you need. If you don't trust me, you might click on the link to check it out before you follow the installation.</p>
<pre><code>(ConstraintSolver) pkg&gt; activate 
Activating environment at `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Project.toml`</code></pre>
<p>&lt;- Just to get back to the general environment for me. You probably don't have the ConstraintSolver so you don't need it.</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; add Revise

   Updating `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Manifest.toml`
 [no changes]</code></pre>
<p>And now v2.7.3 of Revise is installed. Simple, isn't it?</p>
<p>Before I jump into Revise let's stay in this REPL mode for a bit if you don't mind. </p>
<p>Checking which packages one has installed in the current environment:</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; status
Status `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Project.toml`
  [c7e460c6] ArgParse v1.1.0

  [6e4b80f9] BenchmarkTools v0.5.0
  [00ebfdb7] CSTParser v2.4.0
  ...
  [1986cc42] Unitful v1.1.0 [`~/.julia/dev/Unitful`]
  [44d3d7a6] Weave v0.9.4
  [ade2ca70] Dates 
  [8bb1440f] DelimitedFiles 
  [3fa0cd96] REPL</code></pre>
<p>I don't wanna fill your screen ... I have quite a lot installed and can probably uninstall some of them. You can see the version number for each package here (besides standard libraries like Dates). For <code>Unitful</code> you can see that I have checked it out for development. (Just some test I think).</p>
<p>If you want to improve Revise (or any other package) you can use </p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; dev Revise</code></pre>
<p>and then the repo will be cloned to <code>~/.julia/dev/Revise</code> and you can implement your awesome feature.</p>
<p>Okay let's check whether there are some updates:</p>

<p>okay maybe I haven't done this for a bit but some packages get frequently updated ;)</p>
<p>Maybe it's a good moment to talk a bit about <code>Project.toml</code> and <code>Manifest.toml</code> without getting too deep. Each environment has both of these files. </p>
<p><code>Project.toml</code></p><ul>
<li><p>defines the direct dependencies and some bounds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Manifest.toml</code></p><ul>
<li><p>defines all dependencies exactly</p>

<p>The first block gives the name and version of the package. Then <code>[deps]</code> is a list of dependencies with their <code>uuid</code>. In this example my ConstraintSolver needs these 6 packages to function. </p>
<p><code>[compat]</code> describes which versions I need for each of these packages. The symbols like <code>~</code> and <code>^</code> are best described in the <a href="https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/stable/compatibility/">docs</a>.</p>
<p><code>[extras]</code> and <code>[targets]</code> describe some packages I need for my test cases but are not required to use my solver.</p>

<p>Art-Supreme is happy to announce the collaboration with the AI NORN project. To our knowledge this is the first time in history of art that the robotic arm is painting an artwork based on the digital representation of another artificially generated artwork. All of this has been done just with the help of neural network algorithms<strong>.</strong> The team has achieved a new level of cooperation in understanding the use of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; One of the goals of this collaboration is to develop a system that&nbsp; can interact with the real world, allowing users to create their own personalised art with the aid of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Here is the original digital painting </strong>which was created with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Style_Transfer">neural style transfer algorithm</a></p>





<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="417" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6SUAJcOU3u_5tnIGMsYqW-JeHiERm6WPn3iWHGZo9NTJqTffpskhLQYnPXLuf7LuALkdd7iklcx5DywExH3pTfiv9PRITz5oMo_IF30IdDUQBwMs_fusQhpi_hfX93e32TLBZ5J5"></p>



<p><strong>And here is a robotic arm </strong>trying to convey that image onto the canvas. The robotic arm is also running a neural network algorithm which is trained to use the paintbrush in order to minimise the difference between the digital and the real image that is being painted.</p>



<br>

</p></figure></center>



<p><strong>And here is the final result </strong>of the robotic arm</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="437" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z5j-SIqzeWoBV2uxZijnveRtsCW7dNKHLNugkrFxnl1gOvVVkw3Ey0batTrL-TiECLcixht8WBIOxTJywMisa_ngETQQunNEu8D-AqDVNeogkaZJJd1SDGkITx9ZVp3W07_MjXz2"></p>







<p>Some things to say: It’s not perfect. As you can imagine the robot still doesn’t have the ability and freedom that a human hand does. For example the movement angles and finesse of pressure is limited in comparison to a skilled artist.</p>







<p>In conclusion, there is a lot to be done. This is actually just the beginning of this collaboration. One thing is sure; as the technology progresses, the boundary that separates man and machine becomes thinner and thinner.</p>



<p>In that light we see the intelligent machines as a tool which can teach&nbsp; more about ourselves in many yet undisclosed ways. We believe AI art is the next big thing and we are happy that you are here with us getting your insight into creativity and intelligence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the more helpful frameworks that I’ve found in my career has been to aggressively avoid unforced errors in management. In tennis, unforced errors are cases where a player missed a shot due to their own mistake, rather than due to their opponent. In management, unforced errors are problems where the source is <em>you</em>, rather than an objective business need or external circumstance.</p>

<p>I define unforced errors as problems caused by taking action, when doing absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> would have worked just fine: cases when you mess with something that wasn’t broken in the first place. In addition to being annoying, unforced errors distract from existing priorities and open up new fronts in any battles that you’re currently engaged in. And since the solution is so easy – just do nothing – learning how to identify them can pay dividends.</p>

<h2 id="common-types-of-unforced-errors">Common Types of Unforced Errors</h2>

<p>Unforced errors generally come in a few easy to identify forms.</p>

<p>The most common is deciding to “fix” a problem that doesn’t matter, or that doesn’t exist at all. One of the prototypical examples is the decision to migrate to a new technology stack because it seems cool, or because your current technology choice is no longer in vogue. Maybe you’re running Ruby or PHP but really want to try out Rust, despite the fact that your product is otherwise working fine and you’re not having trouble finding and retaining engineers. This invention of a problem can lead to Tech Debt Science Projects in which your team rebuilds otherwise working technology. If anything breaks (it likely will), you’ve caused an unforced error.</p>

<p>Another class of unforced errors comes from deciding to standardize or regulate a system that’s working fine. For example, imagine a case where your engineering teams are all running agile processes differently. Some teams aren’t disciplined about retrospectives, some teams are highly regimented about story sizing while others wing it, and some teams occasionally insert “break” weeks in between sprints so that schedules never quite align. To a certain kind of person, this type of inconsistency feels deeply wrong – like a house in which all of the walls were a very slightly different color.</p>

<p>But your business doesn’t require consistency for aesthetic purposes, or for its own sake. In some situations, you can tolerate somewhat haphazard team processes for a surprisingly long time – dodging the upfront effort of standardization, the ongoing effort of maintaining it, and the overall risk of standardizing on a system that doesn’t actually help everyone on balance. (of course, if there are real upsides to enforcing consistency then you should go for it)</p>

<h2 id="catching-unforced-errors-before-they-happen">Catching Unforced Errors Before They Happen</h2>

<p>In my experience unforced errors often stem from a yearning for control. When times are tough it can be tempting to latch onto areas where you already have mastery and look for ways to optimize them, and this optimization feels like productive work. Ironically, this means that you’re more likely to cause unforced errors, as these familiar domains are areas where you’re probably doing well – focus is needed in the areas of the business that you rarely think about, where your existing decisions are the least battle-tested.</p>

<p>The general solution to unforced errors is to ruthlessly prioritize. Focus on the problems that are truly existential threats to your business and team, or represent transformational opportunities.</p>

<p>My simple heuristic for avoiding unforced errors is to always imagine the worst thing that can happen if you just skip a new project – what would happen if you had never thought about this initiative at all? This is especially true when you’re talking about changing something rather than doing something new. If the worst that happens is that you miss a chance for a 5-10% optimization of a non-essential part of your business, alarm bells should be gently ringing.</p>

<p>Unforced errors are a pain – not only do they distract, but the optics can be pretty bad when a lot of hard work backfires. By avoiding these hiccups, you can keep your team happier and focus on getting the wins that are most important to your business.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page"><div><article><section><div><div><div><p>En medio de los trabajos de remodelación que se vienen realizando en el Mirador Natural, en la Pampa de Nasca, arqueólogos del Plan de Gestión Nasca-Palpa del Ministerio de Cultura y el personal técnico a cargo de dichas labores, lograron identificar un nuevo geoglifo figurativo, -correspondiente a un felino-, que había sido dibujado en una de las laderas de esta colina. </p>

<p>La figura apenas era visible y estaba a punto de desaparecer debido a que se localiza en una ladera de pendiente bastante pronunciada y a los efectos de la erosión natural. En la última semana se realizó la limpieza y conservación del geoglifo, el cual muestra la figura de un felino representado con el cuerpo de perfil y la cabeza de frente, cuyos trazos en su mayor parte estaban bien definidos por una línea de ancho variable entre 30 y 40 cm. </p>

<p>La figura mide 37 metros de largo, visto en forma horizontal y según sus rasgos estilísticos data de la época Paracas Tardío. Es decir, es anterior a las famosas figuras de la Pampa de Nasca, con una antigüedad de 100 a 200 años antes de nuestra era. Representaciones de felinos de este tipo son frecuentes en la iconografía de la cerámica y los textiles de la sociedad Paracas.</p>

<p>Con este descubrimiento se pone en evidencia, una vez más, el rico y variado legado cultural que alberga la zona, la cual además se encuentra dentro del área inscrita en la Lista de Patrimonio Mundial de la UNESCO. De este modo, aun en tiempos de pandemia, personal del Ministerio de Cultura viene contribuyendo con la investigación, la conservación y el desarrollo turístico de la región, en particular de la provincia de Nasca.</p>

<p><strong>Dato:</strong></p>

<p>Las Líneas y Geoglifos de Nasca y Palpa, bien inscrito en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial en el año 1994, son una de las más extraordinarias e inigualables obras del hombre. Las líneas y geoglifos conforman un paisaje cultural con profundo significado y simbolismo, pues expresan el mundo mágico y religioso de las sociedades prehispánicas Paracas y Nasca, quienes durante más de 1,500 años las dibujaron sobre las arenas del desierto y las montañas. Hoy son testimonio del genio creativo de los antiguos pobladores americanos, y de los singulares conceptos y formas de expresión religiosa que desarrollaron a lo largo de su historia. </p>

<p><strong>Sobre el Mirador Natural</strong></p>

<p>El Mirador Natural corresponde a una colina rocosa que se localiza en una sección de la Pampa de Nasca, a la altura del km 426.4 km de la carretera Panamericana Sur. Recibe ese nombre debido a que alrededor de ella confluyen numerosas líneas rectas de diferente ancho y longitud (geoglifos), las cuales se pueden observar desde la cima de la colina. Técnicamente constituye uno de los Centros de Líneas más grandes de la Pampa de Nasca.</p></div></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>The Monday terror intensifies as the weekend nears, the uneasiness reaches its peak on Sunday. Instead of being cheerful, the weekend slips away by dreading the inevitable day. The mere thought about it breaks the brittle bliss house that I hope to stay in on weekends. I wonder why do I hate it so much.</p>
<p>I love writing computer programs and build cool things. I am doing what I always wanted to do - <em>follow my passion</em>. I thought building my career around my passion would be great as it is the holy grail that everybody seeks, after all, you know the quote -<br>
<em>“Do what you love, and you’ll never work another day in your life”</em></p>
<p>I recently came across interesting research done by <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/18/weve-broken-down-your-entire-life-into-years-spent-doing-tasks_a_23248153/">HuffPost Australia</a> about the total percentage of time an average individual spends on throughout their life. Being “in bed” tops the chart, “work” comes in at second place chomping 24% of your entire life. The percentage would soar if you counted the entire workdays (Monday to Friday) as work, because even though you are physically “done for the day”, the mind isn’t at ease.</p>
<p>I wonder what change brought forth this hate for office work, or should I say the lack of change thereof? This is not a blog post about questioning the purpose of life, rather making the 24% of it less miserable.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of working is to earn money which would then be used to buy happiness. We work by the framework defined by the society we live in, mostly 9-5 from Monday to Friday. We follow this system (loop) throughout our life, chasing wealth which would supposedly buy happiness.</p>
<p>What brings happiness to me are the small things that I would do for joy and not for the sake of money, computer programming was one of them. Doing the same thing as part of my job doesn’t bring the same pleasure as before. Even though career-wise I’m doing good, at least for me putting my passion in a 9 to 5 box has surely made it to fade.</p>
<p>If you have reasons to hate Monday, please share in the comments.</p>

          <p><em>Building out a reusable keynote slide plugin with only pure CSS</em></p>
        
        <p>There are a great deal of options available on the web and built into most operating systems when you need to create presentation / keynote slides. You could use native software like LibremOffice Impress, Powerpoint, Apple’s Keynote, etc. You could also decide to use preexisting web-based apps like Google Slides or an open source project such as RevealJS. All of these are good options.</p>

<p>But thinking more about how overly “complex” these apps are implemented, it got me wondering if I could quickly code up a presentation slide “framework” with pure CSS and barely any code…</p>

<p>This is what I came up with:</p>

<h2 id="the-demo">The Demo</h2>

<p data-height="472" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="bradleytaunt" data-slug-hash="jOWBJZb" data-pen-title="Presentation / Keynote Slides (Pure CSS)">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bradleytaunt/pen/jOWBJZb"> Presentation / Keynote Slides (Pure CSS)</a> by Bradley Taunt (<a href="https://codepen.io/bradleytaunt">@bradleytaunt</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Yes, I know this is <em>ugly</em>, but this was created as a barebones skeleton for others to build upon. The demo uses a simple set of <code>radio</code> inputs that correspond to their own individual <code>slide</code> element. The “framework” looks at the currently <code>checked</code> input, then changes the <code>opacity</code> and <code>z-index</code> of it’s corresponding slide item. Pretty straightforward stuff!</p>

<p>Let’s break down each piece:</p>

<h2 id="the-html">The HTML</h2>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slider"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1"</span> <span>checked</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"3"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"4"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"5"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slide"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span>Slide 1<span>&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slide"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span>Slide 2<span>&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slide"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span>Slide 3<span>&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slide"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span>Slide 4<span>&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slide"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;h2&gt;</span>Slide 5<span>&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There isn’t a whole lot going on here. We are just including a set of <code>radio</code> inputs (based on how many slides are desired) along with their corresponding <code>slide</code> class elements. You might notice we don’t do anything to specifically target each individual slide item – you’ll see why we don’t need to in the CSS section!</p>

<h2 id="the-css-scss">The CSS (SCSS)</h2>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scss"><span>/* Basic default styles */</span>
<span>.slider</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>

    <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span>

<span>/* Individual slide styling */</span>

<p>Again – not much to see here. We use CSS to look down through the DOM for each <code>radio</code> elements slide “partner”. We do this by targeting the <code>nth-of-type</code> on both elements. Simple stuff.</p>

<p>Some drawbacks to this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to manually target each new slide you add (color, styling, content, etc.)</li>
  <li>Lack of animations might require extra work to implement (maybe 3rd party libraries like AOS?)</li>
  <li>Probably won’t be best for extremely long/complex presentation slides</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it! Hope you enjoy playing around with it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><img src="https://manybrain.github.io/m8r_blog/img/2020/10/messageflow2.png" alt="Slide showing Mailinator as a message hub"></p>
<h2 id="send-your-webhooks-to-public-mailinator">Send Your Webhooks to Public Mailinator</h2>
<p>You can now direct JSON webhooks from anywhere to Mailinator.com. Mailinator has always been known for email but has actually supported SMS for several years.
Mailinator now allows anyone to post their webhooks directly into the Public (i.e. FREE) Mailinator system.</p>
<p>Messages that arrive this way will arrive in the destination inbox just as an email would. Of course, incoming webhooks will retain their original form
and are visible by clicking the link on the inbox page.  It’s easy too!  Here’s the URL:</p>
<pre><code>https://mailinator.com/api/v2/domains/public/webhook/&lt;destination-inbox&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Posting JSON data to that url will inject that data into the respective Mailinator inbox.  Here’s a full curl command to try it out right now:</p>
<pre><code>curl -v -d '{"from":"MyMailinatorTest", "subject":"testing message", "text" : "hello world", "to" : "jack" }'
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-X POST "https://www.mailinator.com/api/v2/domains/public/webhook/bob/"
</code></pre>
<p>(Check the “bob” inbox at Mailinator.com after running this command)</p>
<h2 id="twilio">Twilio</h2>
<p>Mailinator will accept webhooks from anywhere (your custom webhooks, Zapier, IFTTT … you name it!) but, we’re adding direct mapping support for some more popular services that send webhooks. Twilio is up and running already and just requires a small modification
to the url:</p>
<pre><code>https://mailinator.com/api/v2/domains/public/twilio/&lt;destination-inbox&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="for-mailinator-subscribers---private-webhooks">For Mailinator Subscribers - Private Webhooks</h2>
<p>For Mailinator subscribers, the functionality goes deeper. Firstly, you can publish webhooks to your Private Domain as you’d expect. In addition, incoming webhooks enjoy all
the advantages of private messages with Mailinator including access via Web or API, and execution through the Mailinator Rule System.</p>
<p>By webhooking your SMS messages into your Private Domain, your automated tests now have a one-stop-shop (with just one API you’re already used to), to access the incoming messages
that make up your Message Workflow.</p>
<p>We’re excited about this new feature and excited to see what our Customers will do with it !</p>
<p>You can find more information about the feature in our documentation for both the Public and Private systems.</p>

                    <p>Ethereum scaling solutions. What a wonderful, fiercely debated topic by the community. Since way before the DeFi craze started and long before high gas fees started eating into our profits, we've been talking about it.</p><p>Let's get one thing out of the way. Until about 2 hours ago, I wasn't a big fan of any proposed scaling solution that isn't natively integrated into Ethereum. But after reading the Hermez whitepaper, do see a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. Let's look behind the current CT hype and find out why.</p><p>In short, Layer 2 is an umbrella term for all attempts at taking some of the processing off Ethereum (i.e., taking something "off-chain") to ease congestions and (quite drastically) lowering Gas fees.</p><p>If you've been around for longer than 5 minutes, you've probably heard about all the amazing solutions. And they are always just around the corner. There are even people that <a href="https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1203991003566231553">believe</a> Ethereum scaling solutions are already here.</p><p>In reality, Ethereum still only processes <strong>about 15 transactions per second.</strong> This number is most often compared to Visa, which can process about 2,000 transactions per second.</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 1600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 2008w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ethereum transactions per second (<a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/charts/transactions-per-second">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>A variety of these Layer 2 solutions is currently under development. Some of these have even made it to the mainnet, but none of them is mature or adopted enough to make it worth using —&nbsp;for now.</p><p>Many of which you've probably already heard about. Plasma, Raiden, xDai and OmiseGo, to name just a few, have been around forever. But the hype, as usual, is overpromising and underdelivering. Is Hermez any different?</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-28.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-28.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/image-28.png 1600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-28.png 2274w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ethereum vs Hermez transaction size (<a href="https://hermez.io/hermez-whitepaper.pdf">Source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>One of the proposed scaling technologies for Ethereum is fittingly called <strong>rollups. </strong>The idea is that you take a bunch of transactions, verify them off-chain, and then only store the proof on-chain.</p><p>Hermez aims to deliver one of these solutions.</p><p>Every 10 minutes, Hermez will use what's technically called "ZK-Rollups" to create a batch of transactions and only store the result on-chain. This significantly increases the amount of throughput as the heavy-lifting is done by Hermez instead. There are drastic implications, positive and negative though.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="assets-are-stored-off-chain">Assets are stored off-chain</h2><p>With the current design, L2 networks cannot communicate anything on-chain. All funds are stored, and all transfers are executed, in a <strong>fenced environment.</strong></p><p>Imagine Ethereum transactions would cost $100/transaction, but Bitcoin could do the same transfer for just $3/transaction. You could swap your <code>$ETH</code> for <code>$BTC</code>, transfer the funds and swap them back into your original <code>$ETH</code>.</p><p>Let's ignore for a second that you would have to pay an exchange a fee (twice) and that the <code>BTC/ETH</code> rate might change while you're exposed to Bitcoin. The concept of Layer 2 would then be somewhat similar. All assets you want to make "Layer 2"-capable would first have to be converted to off-chain assets.</p><p>Expect assets like <code>$hETH</code>, <code>$hWBTC</code> and others to take this spot. These would be 1:1 pegged to the assets, equivalent to <code>$WBTC</code> right now. In Hermez's case, the originals would be locked in smart contracts while within their Layer 2.</p><h2 id="not-all-transactions-are-supported">Not all transactions are supported</h2><p>Continuing this analogy and assume you are still in Bitcoin. Some awesome smart contract just popped up and you'd like to invest/play/ape into it. Unfortunately, Bitcoin doesn't have ability to do that. You'd have to swap back first. Of course, as soon as you swapped back, you're exposed to the high transaction fees of Ethereum again. 🤯</p><p>Hermez only supports ordinary transfers. Think: sending some Ether from your personal wallet to an exchange (that doesn't use contracts, e.g. Binance). This is still huge, as per their whitepaper.</p><blockquote>Why focusing on transfers? It turns out that more than 50% of transactions on the Ethereum network are transfers, and a large percent of these are deposits and withdrawals from exchanges. Demand could be reduced by a significant amount if exchanges started using rollups, or (in the ideal case) even agreed to meet on the same rollup. (<a href="https://hermez.io/hermez-whitepaper.pdf">Source</a>)</blockquote><figure></figure><h2 id="incompatibility-across-the-board">Incompatibility across the board</h2><p>Here's the main issue with approaches that are not integrated into the Ethereum core itself. Any solution will have its own protocol, it's own process for on/off-boarding assets and it's own nodes/coordinates/stakees — whatever you want to call it. As it stands, they'd all be incompatible with each other.</p><p>What that means is that, if Binance for example opts into supporting Hermez, but the wallet you use only supports xDai, you will not be able to benefit from it. This incompatibility and competition will make it hard for companies and individuals to choose and, probably, hinder progress for a while.</p><h2 id="transaction-costs-may-be-less-transparent">Transaction costs may be less transparent</h2><p>This one is debatable, and it's something that I did not understand from reading the whitepaper. But after contacting the team, it became clear that fees paid on Layer 2 are not always paid in Ether.</p><p>Anything you transfer to, from or within the Layer 2 network will cost a small fee, deducted from the total amount you're sending. I can see all types of issues with this, but we will have to see how this turns out.</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-30.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-30.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-30.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/image-30.png 1600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-30.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>All the above leads leads to a terrible user experience. If it isn't easy to use, widely adopted and therefore provides a meaningful benefit, nobody will use it. When I started to read the whitepaper, I prepared myself for disappointment. However, my concerns were addressed on page 20:</p><blockquote>To achieve a robust ecosystem of rollups, it is important to enable migrations between different rollups and other L2 applications. To this end, together with the Ethereum community and other researchers from different rollup solutions, some members of the Hermez decentralized community are working on the standardization and compatibility between these technologies. (<a href="https://hermez.io/hermez-whitepaper.pdf">Source</a>)</blockquote><p>It appears that the Hermez team is aware of this and, in fact, aims to build a standard for migrating transactions between different rollup solutions. In the whitepaper, they link to <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mass-migration-to-prevent-user-lockin-in-rollup/7701">this Ethereum research thread</a>.</p><p>Hermez aims to further improve the user experience by providing a web wallet that interacts directly with MetaMask. While still requiring movement of funds between different channels (on/off-chain), it should make it easier.</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-27.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-27.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-27.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-27.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Hermez used what they call "coordinators" to verify off-chain transactions. These coordinators can bid to be rewarded the right to verify the next batch of transactions. While the network is intended to be fully decentralized, it will initially be driven by a "boot coordinator" which the developers control.</p><p>Over time, this boot coordinator will become less relevant as the amount of fees that it can consume (and therefore amount of HEZ it can bid to stay sustainable) is reduced by 5% every month. Eventually, other coordinators could therefore outbid the boot coordinator, making the network fully centralized.</p><p>For all intends and purposes however, this means that Hermez isn't going to be centralized from the start. The whitepaper mentions that the bootstrap period is expected to last 1-2 years. Any longer, the control will be transferred to the HermezDao, powered by Aragon. </p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-26.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-26.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-26.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Hermez introduced their native <code>$HEZ</code> token on Uniswap, without prior private or pre-sales. Starting at $1, it quickly went to $3.16 before settling now at around $2.50 per token.</p><p>The token's primary purpose is for coordinators to bid on the right to verify the next batch of transactions. Coordinators get a bit of everything that is transferred, so there is a bit of a "spend money to make money" dynamic going on.</p><p>So far so good, but unfortunately the inflation is quite high. Quite a lot of it will go to the founders (different from the developers). Personally, this is a big red flag for me as founders might dump without hesitation.</p><h2 id="vesting-schedules">Vesting schedules</h2><p>A little confusing, but Hermez has two different vesting schedules. One for their founders and developers, and one for the token economy and partnerships. Instead of boring you with the details, here's what's going to happen.</p><p><strong>After 6 months, very high inflation is going to kick in.</strong></p><ul><li>Founders / Developers: <strong>36,400 HEX/day</strong></li><li>Token Economy / Partnerships: <strong>106,600 HEX/day</strong></li></ul><p>This comes down to <strong>0.143% inflation per day or</strong> <strong>52.195% per year.</strong> Quite a bit of selling pressure for such a young and unproven project. This will last 2-3 years before all 100 million tokens are released.</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-32.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-32.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-32.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/image-32.png 1600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-32.png 1986w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It is worth mentioning that the whitepaper mentions incentives for early adopters in the form of HEZ airdrops. Once the network is live, it will take snapshots on to remember who deposited DAI, USDT, ETH and HEZ.</p><p>Well, this one was a little bit of a rollercoaster. I started with the assumption that Hermez will be just another Layer 2 solution in a sea of many. After going through the whitepaper, I changed my mind however. Offering a web wallet that directly connects with MetaMask as well trying to create a standard for the industry are both good starts.</p><p>The team also seems to be very knowledgable, not only in the context of scaling solutions, but also when it comes to security. For example, borrowing Groth16 from ZCash to prove/verify transactions efficiently off-chain. These proofs are then stored on-chain, which is different from some other solutions.</p><p>I still haven't quite made up my mind, but Hermez is definitely interesting enough to follow and, potentially accumulate after the hype has died down. The inflation may prove problematic though, so I'd likely exit before it starts.</p><hr><p>What's your take on Ethereum scaling solutions? Do you follow any in particular or are you just waiting for a fully functioning Ethereum 2.0? Let me know your thoughts on <a href="https://t.me/shitcoindaily">Telegram</a>.</p><p>— Robin</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><h2>Theres nothing that can’t be made worse</h2>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20201001">The Treasury has moved to prohibit payment of ransomware ransoms</a>. They’ve said there will be some exceptions, and it is obvious that this won’t be an effective complete global ban on payment. The result, a partial ban on payment, is the worst possible ransomware environment for victims. The impact of different legal regimes governing ransom payments are well documented and understood, <a href="https://rusi.org/publication/occasional-papers/closing-gap-assessing-responses-terrorist-related-kidnap-ransom">see RUSI here</a>.</p>
<p>Banning ransomware payments seems like a means of removing the financial reward for the gangs. It makes intuitive sense that if the victims cannot pay, then the gangs will stop using ransomware. Unfortunately the counterintuitive truth is that an incomplete, ineffective, partial ban will actually make objectively ransomware worse for everyone.</p>
<p>If there is a complete universal global ban, then ransomware ceases to be a source of money and the ransomware gangs stop. Or at least migrate to something else that makes money. We know this scenario is not going to happen.</p>
<h3>What’s the worst that can happen?</h3>
<p>A partial ban creates significant unintended consequences. Firstly, the ransomware gangs still make money from ransomware, so they do <strong>not</strong> cease operations. Then, to encourage payment they become more drastic and extreme in their actions. They have to make a stronger incentive to encourage people who are dissuaded by the ban, but might pay if given sufficient “encouragement”. Then, because the prohibition on payment drives it underground – with all the limited transparency and brutal mechanisms for enforcing compliance — the ransom prices rise. This environment: higher prices, more aggressive ransomware gangs, fewer reputable companies negotiating and handling the ransom payments (and thereby managing the gangs); it is the worst possible situation for everyone.</p>
<h3>How to control attacker behaviour</h3>
<p>The only entity with power to control the behaviour of ransomware gangs is the one providing their protection. The gangs need a place to operate and somewhere to convert their crypto currency into hard currency. They are cashing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto, and there is no way that isn’t raising “know your customer” alerts for money laundering.</p>
<p>The only controlling entity is the one that allows the gangs to operate. The gangs are completely at the mercy of whichever entity provides protection (yes, it’s Russia). This is the rule everywhere that kidnapping gangs operate, and ransomware gangs share this trait with kidnap&amp;ransom (K&amp;R) gangs with regards to their operational requirements.</p>
<h3>Private governance. Better than nothing? Hmm</h3>
<p>The current situation, where there is no criminalisation of payment has created a market place where a number of companies working with insurers are handling the vast majority of ransomware incidents. There are crisis responders who help the companies recover, who arrange a minimal payment, and who get paid by the insurers. This is market governance and it keeps the prices down because there is a sort of gentlemen’s agreement between the gangs and the payment companies. Also, the lack of prohibition means these companies operate in the open and they can share information about pricing etc internally and with each other. (Transparency)</p>
<p>The status quo is not the ideal world, but it is far better than the nightmare of ineffective partial prohibition.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.bygonely.com/old-moscow-1931-photos/">Moscow</a> was the center, heart, and soul of the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The country was recovering from <a href="https://www.bygonely.com/wwii-colorized-photographs/">World War II</a>, and moving towards the rapid development and prosperity. The city housed the headquarters of the Soviet secret service, the KGB, and the developing nuclear and aerospace breakthroughs of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</p>
<p>New architectures, theatres, skyscrapers, and hotels were built in the city during the 1950s. The Hilton Moscow Leningrad kaya, one of Moscow’s Seven Sisters Skyscrapers, was also built-in 1954. Moscow also hosted the 1957 Ice Hockey World Championships and 6th World Festival of Youth and Students.</p>
<p>Here below are some stunning vintage photos that will take you back to the Soviet Moscow in the 1950s.</p>

You may be using Mastodon wrong

<p>I'm sure you have already heard about <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>,
typically marketed as <em>a Twitter alternative</em>.</p>

<p>I will try to convince you that the word <em>alternative</em> doesn't mean here what you think it means,
and why you may be using Mastodon wrong if you find it boring.</p>

<h4>An alternative community</h4>

<p>You should not expect to "migrate from Twitter to Mastodon."</p>

<p>Forget about the privacy angle for now. Mastodon is an alternative community, where people behave
differently.</p>

<p><strong>It's your chance to make new internet friends.</strong></p>

<p>There may be some people for whom Mastodon is a safe haven. Yes, some users really do migrate
there to avoid censorship or bullying but, for most of us, that will not be the case.</p>

<p>Let's put it this way: Mastodon is to Twitter what Linux is to Windows.</p>

<p>Linux is libre software. But that's not why most people use it. Linux users mostly want 
to get their work done, and Linux is an excellent platform.
There is no Microsoft Word, no Adobe Photoshop, no Starcraft. If you need to use these tools, honestly,
you'd better stick with Windows. You can use emulation, in the same way that there are
utilities to post to Twitter from Mastodon, but that would miss the point.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you can perform the same tasks, but the process will be different.
You can post <em>toots</em> on Mastodon, upload gifs, send DMs... but it's not Twitter, and that is fine.</p>

<h4>The Local Timeline is Mastodon's greatest invention</h4>

<p>The problem most people have with Mastodon is that they "get bored" with it quickly. I've seen it a lot, and
it means one thing: <strong>the person created their account on the wrong server</strong>.</p>

<p>"But," they say, "isn't Mastodon federated? Can't I chat with everybody, regardless of their server?"
Yes, of course. But discoverability works differently on Mastodon.</p>

<p>Twitter has only two discoverability layers: your network and the whole world. Either a small group of
contacts, or everybody in the whole world. That's crazy.</p>

<p>They try very hard to show you tweets from outside your network so you can discover new people.
And, at the same time, they show your tweets to third parties, so you can get new followers.
This is the way that
they try to keep you engaged once your network is more or less stable and starts getting stale.</p>

<p>Mastodon, instead, has an extra layer between your network and the whole world:
messages from <em>people on your server</em>. This is called the <em>local timeline</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The local timeline is the key to enjoying Mastodon.</strong></p>

<h4>How long it's been since you made a new internet friend?</h4>

<p>If you're of a certain age you may remember BBSs, Usenet, the IRC, or early internet forums.
Do you recall how exciting it was to log into the unknown and realize that there were people
all around the world who shared your interests?</p>

<p>It was an amazing feeling which got lost on the modern internet. Now you have a chance to relive it.</p>

<p>The local timeline dynamics are very different. There is a lot of respectful interactions among total strangers,
because there is this feeling of community, of being in a neighborhood. Twitter is just the opposite, strangers
shouting at each other.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since the local timeline is more or less limited in the amount of users, you have the chance
to recognize usernames, and being recognized. You start interacting with strangers, mentioning them, sending them
links they may like. You discover new websites, rabbit holes, new approaches to your hobbies.</p>

<p>I've made quite a few new <em>internet friends</em> on my Mastodon server, and I don't mean followers or contacts.
I'm talking about human beings who I have never met in person but feel close to.</p>

<p>People are humble and respectful. And, for less nice users, admins enforce codes of conduct and, 
on extreme cases, users may get kicked off a server. But they are not being banned by a faceless corporation
due to mass reports, everybody is given a chance.</p>

<h4>How to choose the right server</h4>

<p>The problem with "generalist" Mastodon servers like <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>
is that users have just too diverse interests and backgrounds.
Therefore, there is no community feeling. For some people, that may be exactly what they're looking for. But, 
for most of us, there is more value on the smaller servers.</p>

<p>So, how can you choose the right server? Fortunately, you can do a bit of research. 
There is an official <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities">directory of Mastodon servers</a> categorized by
interests and regions. </p>

<p>Since you're reading my blog, start by taking a look at these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bsd.network/">bsd.network</a>, for fans of BSD systems</li>
<li><a href="http://linuxrocks.online/">linuxrocks.online</a>, for Linux fans</li>
<li><a href="http://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, for free software in general</li>
<li><a href="http://tilde.zone/">tilde.zone</a>, for oldschool internet users</li>
<li><a href="https://merveilles.town/">merveilles.town</a>, with a very particular mixture of art and technology</li>
<li><a href="https://metalhead.club/">metalhead.club</a>, to enjoy those classic riffs</li>
</ul>

<p>And the regionals</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mastodont.cat/">mastodont.cat</a> for catalans</li>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.madrid/">mastodon.madrid</a> for madrileños</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more. Simply search online for "mastodon server MY_FAVORITE_HOBBY." And believe me, servers
between 500 and 5,000 people are the best.</p>

<h4>Final tips</h4>

<p>Before clicking on "sign up", always browse the local timeline,
the about page, and the most active users list. You will get a pretty good idea of the kind of people
who chat there.
Once you feel right at home you can continue your adventure and start following users from other servers.</p>

<p>Mastodon has an option to only display toots in specific languages. It can be very useful to avoid being
flooded by toots that you just have no chance of understanding or even getting what they're about.</p>

<p>You can also filter your notifications by types: replies, mentions, favorites, reposts, and more.
This makes catching up much more manageable than on Twitter.</p>

<p>Finally, Mastodon has a built-in "Content Warning" feature. It allows you to hide
text behind a short explanation, in case you want to talk about sensible topics or just about spoiling
a recent movie.</p>

<p>Good luck with your search, and see you on the Fediverse! I'm at

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>A</span> team of physicists in New York has discovered a material that conducts electricity with perfect efficiency at room temperature—a long-sought scientific milestone. The hydrogen, carbon and sulfur compound operates as a superconductor at up to 59 degrees Fahrenheit, the team&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2801-z" target="_blank">reported on&nbsp;October 14, 2020&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em></a>. Thatâ€™s more than 50 degrees hotter than the previous high-temperature superconductivity record set in 2019.</p>

<p>â€œThis is the first time we can really claim that room-temperature superconductivity has been found,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://cfm.ehu.es/team/ion-errea-lope/" target="_blank">Ion Errea</a>, a condensed matter theorist at the University of the Basque Country in Spain who was not involved in the work.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s clearly a landmark,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/people/pickard" target="_blank">Chris Pickard</a>, a materials scientist at the University of Cambridge. â€œThatâ€™s a chilly room, maybe a British Victorian cottage,â€� he said of the 59-degree temperature.</p>
<p>Yet while researchers celebrate the achievement, they stress that the newfound compound—created by a team led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/people/faculty/dias-ranga/index.html" target="_blank">Ranga Dias</a>&nbsp;of the University of Rochester—will never find its way into lossless power lines, frictionless high-speed trains, or any of the revolutionary technologies that could become ubiquitous if the fragile quantum effect underlying superconductivity could be maintained in truly ambient conditions. Thatâ€™s because the substance superconducts at room temperature only while being crushed between a pair of diamonds to pressures roughly 75% as extreme as those found in the Earthâ€™s core.</p>
<p>â€œPeople have talked about room-temperature superconductivity forever,â€� Pickard said. â€œThey may not have quite appreciated that when we did it, we were going to do it at such high pressures.â€�</p>
<p>Materials scientists now face the challenge of discovering a superconductor that operates not only at normal temperatures but under everyday pressures, too. Certain features of the new compound raise hopes that the right blend of atoms could someday be found.</p>
<p>Electrical resistance occurs in normal wires when freely flowing electrons bump into the atoms that make up the metal. But researchers discovered in 1911 that at low temperatures, electrons can induce vibrations in a metalâ€™s atomic lattice, and those vibrations in turn draw electrons together into couples known as Cooper pairs. Different quantum rules govern these couples, which stream together in a coherent swarm that passes through the metalâ€™s lattice unimpeded, experiencing no resistance whatsoever. The superconducting fluid also expels magnetic fields—an effect that could allow magnetically levitating vehicles to float frictionlessly above superconducting rails.</p>
<p>As the temperature of a superconductor rises, however, particles jiggle around randomly, breaking up the electronsâ€™ delicate dance.</p>
<p>Researchers have spent decades searching for a superconductor whose Cooper pairs tango tightly enough to withstand the heat of everyday environments. In 1968, Neil Ashcroft, a solid-state physicist at Cornell University,&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.21.1748" target="_blank">proposed</a>&nbsp;that a lattice of hydrogen atoms would do the trick. Hydrogenâ€™s diminutive size lets electrons get closer to the nodes of the lattice, augmenting their interactions with the vibrations. Hydrogenâ€™s lightness also allows those guiding ripples to vibrate faster, further strengthening the glue that binds the Cooper pairs.</p>
<p>Impractically high pressures are needed to squash hydrogen into a metallic lattice. Still, Ashcroftâ€™s work raised hopes that some â€œhydrideâ€�—a mixture of hydrogen and a second element—might deliver metallic hydrogenâ€™s superconductivity at more accessible pressures.<br></p>
<p>Progress&nbsp;<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031218-013413" target="_blank">took off in the 2000s</a>, when supercomputer simulations let theorists predict the properties of various hydrides, and the widespread use of compact diamond anvils let experimentalists squeeze the most promising candidates to test their mettle.<br></p>
<p>Suddenly, hydrides started setting records. A team in Germany showed in 2015 that a metallic form of hydrogen sulfide—a pungent compound found in rotten eggs—superconducts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14964" target="_blank">âˆ’94 degrees Fahrenheit under 1.5 million times the pressure of the atmosphere</a>. Four years later, the same lab used lanthanum hydride to hit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1201-8" target="_blank">âˆ’10 degrees under 1.8 million atmospheres</a>, even as another group&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.027001" target="_blank">found evidence</a>&nbsp;for superconductivity in the same compound at 8 degrees.</p>
<p>Diasâ€™ lab in Rochester has now shattered those records. Guided by intuition and rough calculations, the team tested a range of hydrogen compounds searching for the goldilocks ratio of hydrogen. Add too little hydrogen, and a compound wonâ€™t superconduct as robustly as metallic hydrogen does. Add too much, and the sample will act too much like metallic hydrogen, metalizing only at pressures that will crack your diamond anvil. Over the course of their research, the team busted many dozens of $3,000 diamond pairs. â€œThatâ€™s the biggest problem with our research, the diamond budget,â€� Dias said.</p>
<p>The winning recipe proved to be a riff on the 2015 formula. The researchers started with hydrogen sulfide, added methane (a compound of carbon and hydrogen), and baked the concoction with a laser.</p>
<p>â€œWe were able to enrich the system and introduce just the right critical amount of hydrogen necessary to maintain these Cooper pairs at very high temperatures,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/ashkan-salamat" target="_blank">Ashkan Salamat</a>, Diasâ€™ collaborator and a condensed matter physicist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
<p>But the fine details of the hydrogen-carbon-sulfur potion theyâ€™ve cooked up elude them. Hydrogen is too small to show up in traditional probes of lattice structure, so the group doesnâ€™t know how the atoms are arranged, or even the substanceâ€™s exact chemical formula.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~ezurek/" target="_blank">Eva Zurek</a>, a computational chemist at the University at Buffalo, belongs to a group of theorists loosely affiliated with Diasâ€™ lab. In early 2020,&nbsp;they&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.101.134504" target="_blank">predicted the conditions</a>&nbsp;under which one metal that might have formed between the diamond anvils should superconduct, and they found different behavior. She suspects that high pressures instead transformed Diasâ€™ substance into an unknown form whose superconductivity is especially robust.</p>
<p>Once Diasâ€™ group can figure out exactly what theyâ€™ve got on their hands (details he and Salamat say are forthcoming), theorists will build models exploring the features that give this hydrogen-carbon-sulfur mixture its superconducting power, in hopes of further modifying the recipe.</p>
<p>Physicists have proved most two-element hydrogen hybrids to be dead ends, but the new three-element blend marks a potentially significant advance into the world of complex chimera materials. One of the elements involved seems particularly promising to some.</p>
<p>â€œWhat I like about this work: They bring carbon into the system,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mpic.de/3538358/Eremets_Group" target="_blank">Mikhail Eremets</a>, an experimentalist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany whose lab set the hydride records of 2015 and 2019.</p>
<p>He explained that the lightness of hydrogen is not the only way to beef up the vibrations that steer electrons into Cooper pairs. Stronger links between neighboring atoms in the lattice also help, and, he said, â€œcarbon has very strong covalent bonds.â€� Materials with carbon frames could bring the added benefit of preventing the whole assembly from tumbling down at the low pressures humans find comfortable.</p>
<p>Zurek agrees. â€œRoom pressure I thought would be very challenging,â€� she said. â€œBut if we can bring carbon compounds into the mix, I think that presents a way forward.â€�</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><p>Published on <!-- -->2020-08-11</p><hr><p>As machine learning, analytics, and data processing become more complex and central to organizations, improving the software behind them becomes more urgent.</p><p>Data within organizations is disorganized and not trusted. Engineers and practitioners feel unproductive and mired in drudgery. Collaboration between data scientists, data engineers, analysts, and other roles that build complex data systems is painful. The software that processes and produces data is unreliable and resistant to change.</p><p>This state of affairs is why Dagster exists, which we first discussed publicly <a href="https://www.dagster.io/blog/introducing-dagster">a year ago</a>.</p><p>Dagster is a new type of workflow engine: a <strong>data orchestrator</strong>. Moving beyond just managing the ordering and physical execution of data computations, Dagster introduces a new primitive: a data-aware, typed, self-describing, logical <strong>orchestration graph</strong>. This graph explicitly models an implicit, pre-existing structure in every data application and platform. We believe this graph is integral to the entire application lifecycle and, when made accessible and operable over an API, can form the basis of an entire ecosystem of tools and libraries.</p><blockquote><h2>Dagster is a new type of workflow engine: a <strong>data orchestrator</strong>.</h2></blockquote><p>Dagster targets two primary audiences. The first is full-stack engineers and data scientists responsible for an entire end-to-end data application and infrastructure. The second is platform teams that enable other data teams to efficiently and autonomously deliver features and capabilities. They both care deeply about the interactions and interfaces between roles, tools, and infrastructure. Technology choices do not limit them: Dagster is flexible and adaptable, designed to run any tool, use any storage, and deploy to any infrastructure.</p><p>What also unites these audiences is the belief that there is something “off” in today’s data systems. Code is under-abstracted and under-tested. Unproductive development environments and repetitive infrastructure management bedevil the developer experience. The systems are too unreliable and difficult to change. The way out is to introduce new abstractions and tools that make these systems more testable, reliable, and fun to build.</p><p>Since our launch, we’ve worked with many users building remarkable systems with Dagster. Our latest release, 0.9.0 — code-named “Laundry Service” — represents the culmination of that year of hard work and learning. This post discusses what we’ve learned, what we’ve built, and the design principles we’ve used to guide the system’s evolution.</p><h2>Data Applications and the Orchestration Graph</h2><p>After a year, we’re more confident in the broad applicability of the concept of a <strong>data application</strong>, which unifies a set of software practices, artifacts, and systems — such as ETL, ELT, and ML training — that have different historical roots but convergent needs and characteristics. We define a data application as <em>a</em> <em>graph of computations that consume and produce data assets</em>.</p><p>The shared characteristics of these systems translate into challenges that data teams feel today:</p><ul><li>Local development with fast feedback cycles</li><li>Effective testing before deployment</li><li>Integration with the diverse tools used by data practitioners</li><li>Collaboration between the different personas that construct them</li><li>Debugging when things go wrong</li><li>Linking data assets to the code that produced them</li><li>Managing application complexity in concert with changing and increasingly demanding requirements</li></ul><p>The net result is systems of stunning complexity, whose formidable needs are not met by the software ecosystem that supports them today.</p><p>In the status quo, traditional workflow engines such as Airflow work with a purely operational dependency graph: ensuring proper execution order, managing retries, consolidating logging, and so forth. These systems were a huge step forward over loosely coupled cron jobs and other solutions that did not formally define dependencies. A narrow focus on execution allowed those systems to be maximally general while demanding minimal change to the code that they orchestrated.</p><p>Dagster makes different tradeoffs, enabling a more structured programming model that exposes a richer, semantically aware graph. The data computations within Dagster are:</p><ul><li>Modeled as coarse-grained functions with typed inputs and outputs, not with parameter-less tasks</li><li>Connected with data dependencies, not with pure execution dependencies</li><li>Parametrized by schematized configuration separate from code, not tightly coupled, loosely structured code and configuration</li><li>Executable in multiple environments (dev, test, and prod), not bound to a specific deployment</li><li>Observable via stream of metadata events, not complete “black box” computations</li><li>Viewable in tools in your local environment with no infrastructure requirements, not only after deployment and execution</li></ul><p>We call this opinionated structure the orchestration graph. This graph and the tools built on its API enable a dramatically improved way to structure data systems. It can be tested, deployed, executed, reused, and debugged flexibly. A software engineering process can be built around it in which multiple teams and personas can be effective, and it naturally becomes the system of record for your data processes.</p><blockquote><h2>The orchestration graph is the abstraction that connects all practitioners.</h2></blockquote><p>We designed this graph and system with broader principles in mind. These principles encode our beliefs about the underlying nature of data applications and the direction of the broader ecosystem.</p><ol><li><strong>Acknowledge and manage complexity: </strong>Data application construction is an extraordinarily and subtly difficult endeavor, and the status quo is under-abstracted software that results in chaos and untamed complexity. The complexity cannot be wished away. Instead, acknowledge it and adopt the abstractions and engineering processes needed to manage it.</li><li><strong>Embrace heterogeneity:</strong> Data tools and systems are heterogeneous for a good reason: people with diverse skill sets, needs, and tool preferences build them. They are deployed and execute on a wide range of infrastructure. Rather than forcing homogeneity and vertical integration, embrace heterogeneity and manage it with cross-cutting tools and software abstractions.</li><li><strong>Data-aware orchestration: </strong>Computations in data applications consume and produce data. The orchestrator should be aware of this. Typed data dependencies mean correct, testable, and understandable software. Structured metadata events emitted by computations are a definitive log of operational data and asset creation, forming a critical base layer for data catalogs, data lineage, and self-service ops.</li></ol><p>The orchestration graph is <em>the</em> common abstraction that connects all practitioners. Practitioners may use different computational runtimes, storage systems, programming languages, and tools, but the data assets they consume and produce must come from somewhere and go somewhere. This universality makes it a natural point of leverage for shared tools, collaboration, and managing system complexity. The orchestration graph should not only order computation: it should <em>structure</em>, <em>organize</em>, and <em>interrelate</em> computations and the assets they produce.</p><h2>Acknowledge and Manage Complexity</h2><h3>This is software.</h3><p>It bears repeating that data applications are software applications, and many of the principles of software engineering have their corollaries in the data domain. But attempts to blindly apply traditional software engineering techniques to data often fall short of their promise, especially compared to the impact of nontraditional tools like notebooks. We need to adapt software engineering concepts to this adjacent domain, where uncontrolled inputs and heavy-weight side effects are the rule rather than the exception.</p><p>We think data engineering today is in a similar position as web frontend engineering was a decade ago: wrestling with a novel and complex domain, dramatically under-tooled, and often regarded with unjustified disdain by practitioners in better-understood domains with more mature tooling, like systems programming. At that time, frontend engineering needed changes in web standards and browser APIs, new programming models and runtimes, and investment in tools. Today, even novice frontend developers work in sophisticated frameworks — built on what was considered arcane functional programming principles — with high-quality tools supported by a healthy ecosystem.</p><p>Just like web frontend ten years ago, we believe that data application engineering needs new approaches. Dagster offers a set of novel abstractions that lead to more resilient, testable, reusable code.</p><p>Take this example, which incorporates a number of our abstractions into a data computation executed in Pandas:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*Xe-s_p-g3ugkZBGC2p--WQ.png" width="700px"></p><p>This example uses Pandas to load data about cereals, compute a new feature, sugar_per_cup, and then filter out cereals below a certain, configurable percentile of that feature. We then save that result as a file in a data lake.</p><p>This code demonstrates a few notable properties of Dagster:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Functional Computations</strong>: The core abstraction is a <em>solid, </em>a functional unit of computation in the orchestration graph. These solids describe their data requirements (in the form of typed inputs and outputs), configuration (with config_schema), and environmental requirements (expressed as required_resource_keys).</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Dependencies</strong>: Solids are connected using data-aware dependencies. The system takes responsibility for marshaling data (or pointers to data) from the outputs of one solid to the inputs of another. This code builds the orchestration graph structure but does not directly execute it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gradually Typed Inputs and Outputs</strong>: Dagster uses a gradual, optional type system. Note that the input into add_sugar_per_cup is a DataFrame type with no constraints on its internal structure. However, its output defines column schema and other constraints verified at runtime. These are flexible user-defined types specified in software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configurable</strong>: Solids (as well as other artifacts) can also declare a typed configuration schema …</p></li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>The blog post is a write up of my two talks from <a href="http://pygotham.tv/">PyGotham</a> and <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2020/">PyCon India</a> titled, <code>Build Plugins with Pluggy.</code> The write-up covers a trivial use-case, discusses why a plugin-based architecture is a good fit, what is plugin-based architecture, how to develop plugin-based architecture using pluggy, and how pluggy works.</p>
<h3 id="trivial-use-case">Trivial Use Case</h3>
<p>For the scope of the blog post, consider a command-line application queries <code>gutenberg</code> service, processes the data, and displays the relevant information. Let’s see how to build such an application using pluggy.</p>
<p>Here is the JSON output from the application.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The <code>print_output</code> function supports one output format. It’s easy to add one more format. When the application is a library, <code>print_output</code> suffers from a few issues while supporting more output renderers. It’s hard for a developer to support all possible and requested formats by end-users. It’s painful to extend the functionality to every format. One way to extend the functionality is to re-architect the code to follow plugin based architecture.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-plugins">What are plugins?</h3>
<p><strong>noun</strong>: plug-in is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program.</p>
<p>A plugin is a software component that enhances or modifies the behavior of the program at run-time. For example, Google Chrome extension or Firefox addon change the behavior or adds functionality to the browser. The browser extensions are good example for plugin based architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://kracekumar.com/images/plugin/Plugin_Architecture_.png" alt="Build%20Plugins%20with%20Pluggy%203e282afb83124aa3a24625f192178932/Plugin_Architecture_.png"></p>
<p>In general, plugin architecture has two main components - <strong>host/caller/core system</strong> and <strong>plugin/hook</strong>. The host or core system is responsible for calling the plugin or hook at registered functionality.</p>
<h3 id="pluggy-introduction">Pluggy introduction</h3>
<p>Pluggy is a Python library that provides a structured way to manage, discover plugins, and enable hooks to change the host program’s behavior at runtime.</p>
<p>Here is the code structure of the application.</p>

  <p>This article considers the conditions that lead teams to produce overengineered software and describes how you can avoid falling prey to such conditions.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-overengineering">What do we mean by “overengineering”?</h2>

<p>When a software developer says that a piece of software is <em>overengineered</em>, they are saying that they think it has too many moving parts, too much abstraction, or an excessive emphasis on performance. The number of concepts required to understand the thing feels unreasonable.</p>

<p>It’s a fundamentally subjective call, but you know it when you see it. Like a Ferrari at a go kart race, an overengineered system is out of scale with its operating environment and intended usage.</p>

<p>But how does it happen? Are there certain conditions that lead teams to produce systems that observers would perceive as overengineered?</p>

<p>To determine this, let’s consider two stereotypical software
engineering phenomena: cargo culting and a related pattern that I’ve
started to call “the Xoogler effect”.</p>

<p>From there, we can characterize certain cognitive biases that drive a team towards overengineering.</p>

<h2 id="cargo-culting">​​Cargo culting</h2>
<p><img src="https://evanm.website/images/overengineering/cloudnativelandscape.jpg" alt="The Trillion Dollar Homepage"><span>Fig. 1. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">The Trillion Dollar Homepage</a>.</span></p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> is a cultural phenomenon in which technologically-advanced artifacts become objects of obsessive ritual to a group of people outside of the artifact-producing society. While the term has fallen out of favor within the field of anthropology (in acknowledgement of its reductive and colonialist overtones), it’s fairly common in software circles.</p>

<p>To a software engineer, “cargo culting” is used pejoratively to refer to the adoption of a technology or practice based solely on its origin or popularity. Loosely, the thinking goes that if a tool, language, or convention was developed at or inspired by ideas from a large, successful company, then that tool must have contributed to the company’s success. Thus, in adopting it, you increase your odds of also succeeding.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Era-defining companies like Intel and Google used OKRs, so we should too.”</li>
  <li>“The SRE book talks about how Google relies on service level objectives, so using them will help our services become more reliable.”</li>
  <li>“Most successful companies end up needing advanced load balancing and request-proxying systems to scale their microservices architectures. Our 10-person startup should adopt these systems in order to help us scale.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Like incorporating in Delaware or only hiring graduates of name-brand universities, a particular practice correlating with notable instances of company growth doesn’t imply causation. Just because a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">popular or successful</a> company uses a technology doesn’t mean that it’s appropriate or worthwhile for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="the-xoogler-effect">The Xoogler effect</h2>

<p>When people leave engineering jobs at big, successful tech companies, they take their former employer’s engineering culture with them. This tends to be highly valuable, for both the technical acumen of the new company and the incoming engineer’s compensation package.</p>

<p>But this tendency can be taken too far. The incoming employee, believing that they have a direct line to the state of the art, may go on to recreate systems in their former employer’s image to an unreasonable degree.</p>

<p>Not to pick on Googlers, but something about that company’s culture really brings this out. There are many notable examples of Xooglers replicating Google-internal systems and practices in the outside world, either as independent startups or efforts within existing companies. I don’t find this terribly surprising, given the tone that’s set within Google—you spend your time there constantly being told that you’re among the best software engineers to walk the face of the Earth, using technologies unmatched in their power, quality, and scalability. It makes sense that former employees feel compelled to emulate things that worked at Google<sup><a id="fn1ref" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But this generalizes to other large and/or successful companies. Many people leave the productivity bubble of a “FAANG and friends” company and end up building tools and systems that they miss. To name but a few, this is how we got Thrift, Envoy, and <a href="https://bazel.build/">three</a> <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">different</a> <a href="https://buck.build/">tools</a> based on Google’s build system.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-biases">Cognitive biases</h2>

<p>I think these two phenomena can be linked to a handful of widely-known cognitive biases. Cargo culting is a clear manifestation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">authority bias</a>. And the Xoogler effect seems related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">the law of the instrument</a>.</p>

<p>It’s rational to want to stay within your <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/12/circle-of-competence/">circle of competence</a>, but it can be counterproductive in excess. When you’ve been inculcated in the expert use of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. Your thinking in new environments is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchored</a> by prior experience in old environments, which can impede learning and the development of new skills.</p>

<p>And it turns out that these two patterns can feed on each other. Cargo culting is <em>catalyzed by</em> the Xoogler effect in cases when a former big company employee’s experience is uncritically venerated by new colleagues.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-resist-the-urge-to-overengineer">How to resist the urge to overengineer</h2>

<p>Resisting the temptation to overengineer requires one to be honest with themselves about the context in which they’re operating.</p>

<p>You should always design systems to address problems that are in front of you instead of falling for solutions to problems faced by big companies in the past. You shouldn’t base your company’s infrastructure on GitHub stars. And as wistful as you may be for your last company’s tools, they may not be as applicable to your current situation as you think.</p>

<h3 id="assessing-cargo-without-becoming-a-cultist">Assessing cargo without becoming a cultist</h3>

<p>When evaluating a popular tool, language, or convention, it’s worthwhile to take the time to understand the underlying forces that motivated its invention<sup><a id="fn2ref" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Before making any decisions, try to contextualize a technology within the environment that formed it. From there, you can pattern match that environment to your own in order to determine if the technology is appropriate.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s consider everyone’s favorite overengineering punching bag: Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Kubernetes traces its conceptual lineage to Borg<sup><a id="fn3ref" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, the cluster-management system that’s run Google’s production workloads for over a dozen years. The main value that Borg provides to Alphabet is its ability to maximize the capital efficiency of their datacenters. The technology that we now call “container orchestration” allowed them to get more computing oomph out of their fleet by maximizing utilization and making more efficient use of machines they’d already paid for.</p>

<p>Is maximizing capital efficiency of your datacenter or cloud environment a concern for your company? If you believe Kubernetes offers other benefits<sup><a id="fn4ref" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>, are you confident that they outweigh the complexity and maintenance overhead?</p>

<p>I find this thought process helpful when evaluating new tools, patterns, frameworks, or management practices. Conventional wisdom advocates that you fully understand a problem before applying a solution to it. It’s also important to understand the conditions that led to a solution and how those conditions align with those you find yourself in.</p>

<p>Regardless of the decision you end up making, this process is likely to make you a better engineer. The job is fundamentally about building systems to solve problems at reasonable cost. That cost is measured not only as upfront capital expenditure, but in the ongoing drag associated with maintenance and cognitive load. More often than we realize, engineering is about right-sizing a solution in light of these ongoing costs.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The intellectual property debate is so hot these days that I can’t wander into a restroom without running across graffiti supporting one side or the other. Some people think that patents and other forms of intellectual property law are the bane of the free universe, and that these laws are not just misguided but actually evil and should be struck down as soon as possible. Others are convinced that pretty much the whole world economy is driven by intellectual property. And those people want to do anything to strengthen the legal status of IP rights. <mark>As a result, the graffiti on the issue gets quite graphic at times.</mark></p>

<p>Of course, most of it is on the virtual restrooms on the Internet, not so much the restrooms in the hotspots of San Jose’s nightlife<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
This, as anybody who lives in San Jose can tell you, is called IRONY. San Jose doesn’t have nightlife. People living here drive to San Mateo if they actually want to have fun
</span>.
There’ll be huge flamefests over some specific issue associated with intellectual property law, with people arguing everything from First Amendment rights to whether IP law might make open source development impossible sometime in the future. I find myself certifiably schizophrenic on the issue.</p>

<p>It’s not that I don’t have an opinion: I have very strong opinions on the worth of intellectual property, but they end up being on both sides of the argument. I can tell you, this can be very confusing. It means that I end up arguing both sides. And I think this is because there really are two sides to intellectual property, and they share nothing but the name.</p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property-is-not-property">Intellectual ‘Property’ is not Property</h2>

<p>To many people, including me, intellectual property is all about human inventiveness, about the very thing that makes us humans instead of animals (that, and thumbs, of course). And in that setting, the very name “intellectual property” is an affront: It’s not property to be sold like chattel, it’s the act of creation, it’s the greatest thing any human can ever do. It’s Art, with a capital A. It’s the Mona Lisa, but it’s also the end result of a long night of programming, and it’s an end result that you as a programmer are damned proud of. <mark>It’s something so precious that selling it isn’t even possible: It’s indelibly a part of who you are.</mark></p>

<p>That kind of creativity—whether it be in the form of painting, music, sculpture, writing, or programming—should be sacred. The creator and the thing he or she created have a bond that cannot be severed. It’s like the bond between a mother and child, or between bad Chinese food and MSG. But at the same time it’s something that everybody in the whole world should be able to be part of, because it is humanity.</p>

<p>And then, in the other corner, weighing in at an approximate seven gadzillion billion U.S. dollars a year, intellectual property is huge business. Human creativity got a price tag, and it turned out to be quite expensive. Creativity is rare, and as a result it is not just expensive but also extremely lucrative. Which brings in a totally different class of arguments, and totally different kinds of people. The kind of people who call the end result of human creativity “property.” Not to mention, of course, lawyers.</p>

<p>Read the title of this paper again. The “property” people are winning. After all, their name stuck. So what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The most well-known example of intellectual property is the notion of copyright. Copyrights are basically the codification of the rights of any creator to do with his or her creation as he or she wishes. The “owner” of the creation can decide on how that creation should be used.</p>

<p>Copyrights are also legally very simple to get. You don’t have to register your copyright: You are automatically the copyright holder of whatever creative work you do. This is an important distinction from most other intellectual property law, mainly because it actually makes it easy for individuals, not just big corporations, to own copyrights. You can own a copyright, simply by virtue of writing, painting, or generally creating something unique. If you want to, you can add a legend like “(C) Copyright 2000 Yourname Here,” but quite frankly, you don’t need to. You own the copyright whether you say so or not. Saying so just makes it easier for other people to track you down if they want to use your work.</p>

<p>Of course, just owning a copyright in itself is not very useful. But the fact that you own what you create means that you can control how it is used. You have, for example, the right to sell such a work of art to somebody else, and nobody but the IRS gets to have any say in the matter. But it’s about more than just the money, and that’s where a lot of people seem to find themselves flummoxed.</p>

<p>For example, you can use your power as owner of a copyright to try to do more interesting things than just sell it. You can license it. This is even better than selling it; <mark>instead of selling the work of art you can sell the license to do certain things to it, and still retain the copyright on it. Basically, you can have your cake and eat it, too.</mark> This is how the Microsofts of the world get created: endlessly selling the rights to use something, without actually losing anything. No wonder people just love to own this kind of property.</p>

<h2 id="problems-of-treating-ip-as-property">Problems of Treating IP as Property</h2>

<p>Does anybody perhaps start to see a problem here? If you don’t see anything strange so far, I have a bridge and a few pieces of waterfront property to sell you.</p>

<p>The basic problem with intellectual property is starting to show itself: You as the owner of intellectual property can effectively sell it forever, without ever losing anything yourself. You don’t risk anything, and in fact you might decide to write your license in a way that basically says that even if the property is flawed, you cannot be held responsible in any way. Sounds preposterous? You’d be surprised. So, intellectual property offers no consumer protection.</p>

<p>It gets worse. The copyright holder not only has the right to sell his or her property without losing it, but also the right to sue people who sell property that looks like his or hers. Clearly the copyright owner has rights over that derived work. <em>Clearly</em>? Not so fast.</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line between inspiration and copying? And what happens when different people come up with similar ideas? Who gets the gravy train of being able to sell his idea over and over and over again, and gets to tell the other people to butt out of his business? <mark>It’s not just consumers who aren’t protected, it’s also other creative people who are not protected by the notion of “intellectual property.”</mark></p>

<p>What makes the discussion ugly at this point is that a lot of the arguments for stronger intellectual property rights are based on the notion of giving inventors and artists more “protection.” What people don’t seem to ever realize is that giving such powerful rights to some people also ends up taking rights away from others.</p>

<p>And maybe not so surprisingly, the proponents of stricter intellectual property laws are the organizations that stand to gain the most. Not the artists and inventors themselves, but the clearinghouses of IP: companies that make a living off other people’s creativity. Oh, and lawyers, of course. The end result? Copyright law amendments like the infamous Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which removes the last vestiges of consumer rights over the use of copyrighted material.</p>

<p>Now, if you are getting the notion that I think copyrights are actually detrimental, you’re wrong. I happen to absolutely love copyrights, I just don’t believe in taking the rights of the authors too far. Not to the point of screwing the consumer over. And I say this not just as a consumer, but as a producer of copyrighted material myself, both in the form of this book and of Linux itself.</p>

<p><mark>I, as a copyright holder, have my rights. But with rights come obligations—or as they say in certain neighborhoods, <em>noblesse oblige</em>.</mark> And so I have the obligation to use those rights in responsible ways, and not as a weapon against others who lack such rights. As one great American once declared, “Ask not what your copyright can do for you, ask what you can do for your copyright”—or something to that effect.</p>

<h2 id="patents-make-the-problem-uglier">Patents Make the Problem Uglier</h2>

<p>Copyright is, despite even the DMCA, a fairly mild and well-behaved form of intellectual property. The notion of “fair use” does still exist, and holding a copyright does not give all rights to the work to the copyright holder.</p>

<p>The same cannot be said for patents, trademarks, and trade secrets; the heavy drugs of IP. Discussions over software patents in particular have gotten so inflamed in technical circles that it officially counts as one of the subjects you should not discuss in polite company, along with gun control, abortion rights, medical marijuana, and whether Pepsi tastes better than Coca Cola. And the reason is that patents, in many ways, give control over new inventions similar to that of copyrights, but with few of the redeeming qualities of copyrights.</p>

<p>One of the most awkward issues with patents is that, unlike with copyrights, you don’t get a patent just for inventing something new. No, <mark>you get a patent after you’ve gone through the painful and prolonged process of filing for it with the patent office.</mark> Waiting for the patent office, by the way, is a bit like standing in line at the DMV, but you have to realize that you stand in line with about twelve patent lawyers, and the line is …</p></section></div>

<p>
This tool might help determine whether your symptoms were likely to be COVID-19
or not by implementing the model from this paper:
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2</a>.<br>
The study was published in May 2020, using about 7000 known-positive COVID-19
cases with self-reported symptoms to derive and test said model. Note that
this does <i>not</i> predict whether you currently have COVID-19 but whether
you <i>have had</i> COVID-19.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note that this is NOT validated or endorsed by the authors of that paper
and that this is <span>NOT a replacement for a real test</span>!</strong><br>
I personally compared the results with doing the calculation manually, but
regardless, the uncertainty in this implementation and the uncertainty in the
original model compound. The result below is a vague indication only.
</p>

<p>Your answers are not sent anywhere, there are no cookies, no nothing.</p>

<div>
	<p>Loading script...</p>
	<!-- Not all noscript-like add-ons trigger the noscript tag, so can't really use that... -->
	<p>If this takes more than a second or two, might JavaScript be turned off?</p>
	<p>
	Because the data must not leave your browser, the computation is done with
	JavaScript and there is no fallback pure HTML form. Your browser does not
	appear to support JavaScript and so this calculation will not work. There
	are no scripts on the page except the test itself: no visitor counting, no
	ads, no tracking, no nothing.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
        <time datetime="2020-08-12">2020-08-12</time>
      <p>Let's write some Elixir.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      bar(a, -1)
    else
      bar(a, 1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    IO.inspect(a * b)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Not very useful, but that's good enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>I like Elixir, but I think most of the time it just looks like functional Ruby. I want to make this code look like Elixir.</p>
<p>First, this code is lacking every Elixir developer's best friend: <code>|&gt;</code>. Let's add some <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Meh. It's definitely better, but I mean, that's only 3 <code>|&gt;</code>s. I want more <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>We have an <code>if</code> in there, so maybe we can do something with it?</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    (a &lt; 0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We sure can! That's one more <code>|&gt;</code>. Can we do better than this?</p>
<p>Well... <code>&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are <code>Kernel</code> functions, so maybe...</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is great, can we keep going?</p>
<p>The Elixir docs say <code>defmodule</code> is just a macro. Does that mean I can just <code>|&gt;</code> into <code>defmodule</code>?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Yes you can!</p>
<p><code>def</code> and <code>defp</code> are macros too right?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>So many pipes! 😍</p>
<p>We're getting somewhere, but something still doesn't feel right. This module really isn't doing much, so maybe it should not be that long? Also, I think we need more <code>:</code>. Atoms are very Elixir-y, so let's do more of that:</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule(do: (
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def(do: a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if(do: a |&gt; bar(-1), else: a |&gt; bar(1)))

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp(do: a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect())
))
</code></pre>
<p>We're <code>:do</code>ing great!</p>
<p>You know what's also very Elixir-y? Lists. Lists and tuples.</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule([{:do, (
  a
  |&gt; foo()
  |&gt; def([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if([{:do, a |&gt; bar(-1)}, {:else, a |&gt; bar(1)}])}])

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()}])
)}])
</code></pre>
<p>Who's going to say this looks like Ruby now? ⚗️</p>

Define only the fields you need to access in that scope.</p><p>For example, when you define a function, use a minimal definition for the argument types. Also, as a bonus that function is more generic and it is not coupled to a complex type. This simplifies your dependency graph and is one of the greatest advantages of Typescript over most other typed languanges: Typescript implements duck-typing.</p><div><div><div><div><pre><code>

They should be treated the same logically in your code.</p><p>However, I do sometimes use them to distinguish intent in the code:</p><ul><li><code>undefined</code> to indicate an empty optional field - i.e. it doesn't exist and that's normal</li><li><code>null</code> to indicate the default value - i.e. an object that normally should have value, but is not initialized yet</li></ul><p>However, those differences are subtle and it may be better to just use undefined for everything. Logically they should be treated the same in most cases.</p><p>In fact, the only place I have seen a logical difference between them is when updating an object in a storage system: </p><ul><li><code>undefined</code> could mean ignore the field (no change) </li><li><code>null</code> could mean reset that field (remove the value)</li></ul><p>However, that pattern is likely to introduce bugs so be careful. Thankfully, typescript keeps track of each and allows you to specify if one or the other is required.</p><h4>Union Types</h4><p>With union types, we are starting to use Typescript's real power.</p><p>A union type is essentially the or operator (<code>|</code>) for types: i.e. it's a type that could be any of multiple types.</p><p>Typescript handles union types like a pro. It understands all the runtime operations that could constrain a type and protects you from mistakes. For example, an <code>if</code> statement can be used to constrain the type to a specific possibility.</p><p>In the below example, <code>keyOrObject</code> could be a <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code>, or an object with one of many possible id fields.</p><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> getStringKey = (

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.</p><p>It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.</p><p>These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.</p><p>People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.</p><p>While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, <a href="https://accordably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution</a>.</p><h2><strong>How do you find a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>Alright, great, you want to start a business, but how do you actually find a cofounder?</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this was the easy part, but it’s actually probably the hardest.</p><p>It’s going to be a lot of trial and error.</p><p>We are in more restricted social times, so it becomes even more difficult. A good place to start is with previous colleagues that you’ve worked with. You know them from a professional perspective, you’ve seen how they act with colleagues and their work ethic.</p><p>Remember, the stakes are much higher when it’s your own business, so these favourable employee working traits don’t always translate into a good cofounder.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend checking out different digital communities, you’d be surprised who you’ll meet and might find someone that has very similar goals to you.</p><p>My personal favourite community is Indie Hackers. They have a specific group called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/looking-to-partner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Looking to partner up”</a> and you will find a wide variety of people looking to start a business.</p><p>I am biased as that’s where I met the cofounder of Accordably.</p><h2><strong><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" alt="Remote cofounders of Accordably" width="1279" height="356" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w"></strong></h2><h2><strong>What to look for when choosing a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>The ideal match is someone who is the complete opposite of your skillset. Think of it like an ice hockey team. If your team was all goalies, you’d get nowhere. You need balance and different strengths to help push your product over the top.</p><p>Now one thing that shouldn’t be the complete opposite is your motivation. Finding someone who has the same drive is important or else there could be a growing resentment in your near future.</p><p>No two situations are the same and this is why it’s difficult to find a cofounder. There needs to be the right mix of similar professional goals and differing skillsets to build a strong tandem.</p><p>Another important attribute is whether you can see yourself getting along with this person from a social perspective. Face it, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time speaking with this person and planning out the future of your business.</p><p>There are some personality types that just don’t mix. Even if your skillsets are the perfect match, your mental health could be at risk if find yourself in a toxic work relationship.</p><p>For me, building a startup isn’t necessarily about the money (I mean it helps of course!) but it’s an outlet where my voice has a direct impact on the future of the business. I can test out crazy ideas and not worry about angry investors or upsetting management.</p><h2><strong>How to build trust when you’ve never met?</strong></h2><p>Just because you meet somebody in person doesn’t automatically create trust. Everyone has their own problems and you’ll never truly understand all the factors that go into their decisions.</p><p>So how do you build trust?</p><p>Time.</p><p>It takes time to build trust, you need to learn each others working habits, personalities and goals. After 2 weeks of working together, you should have a good understanding of the other person.</p><p>Of course, 2 weeks isn’t enough to jump into anything long term, but it will give you a good idea of direction and at that point, you can choose whether or not to continue.</p><p>While you should protect yourself, there’s no need to waste money on lawyers right at the start. Just write up a basic agreement that lays out your agreed upon terms and that you will revisit at a later stage.</p><p>Even with an agreement created by lawyers, you can get screwed over, so don’t worry about this too much at the start.</p><h2><strong>Finding the right idea</strong></h2><p>You’ve assembled a strong team, your skills match perfectly and you’re ready to go, but you’re missing one thing.</p><p>The idea!</p><p>This is difficult because whatever you choose you will be committing a large chunk of time to it, so you don’t want to make the wrong choice and get startup remorse.</p><p>Now I can’t stress this enough, no matter what you choose, make sure that it genuinely interests you. I’ve been in many situations that after the initial sparkle of an idea wears off, I’m stuck with a product that I find soul-crushingly boring.</p><p>The product may make money, but if you don’t enjoy it, it’s not worth it.</p><p>The approach that we took was rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis, we just started with something.</p><p>We started working on a server-side web analytics solution and testing the market on this idea. We focused on building the infrastructure and easily transferable parts that we could use for other ideas.</p><p>After about a month of building, two things happened:</p><ol><li>We had enough time to see if our working styles meshed, which they did.</li><li>An idea popped up from a client request that we both believed in.</li></ol><p>Long story short, instead of beating your head against a wall trying to find the perfect idea, <strong>just start! </strong></p><p>Start with anything, inspiration will come, staying stagnant will just make you another wantrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Maintaining communication</strong></h2><p>When it comes to remote cofounders the importance of communication is multiplied. Setting up the proper channels and maintaining a clear schedule is critical for success.</p><p>Keeping your teammate informed of your daily/weekly goals helps motivate and set accountability.</p><p>It’s very easy to procrastinate when you’re “the boss” but when you see your cofounder working their ass off and you’re doing nothing, that guilt should set in. Unless of course, you’re a prick.</p><p>Our main communication hub is Slack and we have integrated all of our tools to send notifications to this platform. This is our main dashboard and it helps keeps us on the same page for the health of the business.</p><p>Figure out what works for your duo and run with it. For us, we will have one or two calls a week and then for the smaller topics, just send each other audios clips.</p><p>This style has worked for us because when a thought is fresh, you can send a quick audio snippet and the other can listen to it when they have time.</p><p>Getting sidetracked is a big problem, so try to stay on goal and not overcommunicate with long phone calls every day.</p><p>One piece of advice that I can share when it comes to communication is that tone is not conveyed properly over text. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people get upset over an email or Slack message from a misunderstanding in tone.</p><p>In this digital world, don’t forget how to communicate. Jumping to conclusions or negatives will just set your team back. Clarify before making an unnecessary enemy.</p><h2><strong>Trust your gut</strong></h2><p>There is no one size fits all formula to finding a cofounder. People aren’t predictable. It takes time to find the right fit.</p><p>The one constant is your gut because no matter who you choose, you’re going to have to take a chance.</p><p>You could get burned or feel like you’re doing all the work, that’s just collateral damage in the life of an entrepreneur.</p><p>All that you can do is work with the information you’re given and decide if you believe in your cofounder. When it works, it works and you’ll eventually see success.</p><p>That’s what we’re working towards with Accordably and we’re excited to see what’s next for this project.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>This post is a write-up of a solution to part of a programming puzzle I did yesterday. It’s a little different than the usual “solution + theory” approach, though: I’m going to talk about the actual steps you’d need to take to get to the solution (i.e.&nbsp;what to google, what intermediate code looks like, etc.). Often write ups like this are presented as finished artefacts, with little info on the tricks or techniques the author used to jog their intuition into figuring out the puzzle (or where some intermediate step requires a leap of insight). In actual fact, this particular puzzle requires almost no insight <em>at all</em>: I’m going to show how to get to a working solution without understanding any of the theory behind it!</p>
<p>Spoilers ahead for the google foobar problem “Distract the Guards”.</p>

<p>We’re interested in a particular type of sequences of pairs of numbers. These sequences are generated from a starting pair <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>m</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math> like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>m</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math> are equal, the sequence stops.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the smaller number is subtracted from the larger, and then the smaller is doubled, and the sequence continues with these two numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example starting with 3 and 5:</p>
<pre><code>     3, 5
     6, 2
     4, 4
---- done ----</code></pre>
<p>Once it hits <code>4, 4</code>, the first condition is met, and the sequence stops. Not all of these sequences stop, however:</p>
<pre><code>     1, 4
     2, 3
     1, 4
---- done ---- </code></pre>
<p>As you can see, in this case we loop back around to <code>1, 4</code>: our task is to figure out, given a pair of numbers, whether the sequence generated by them loops forever, or stops at some point.</p>

<p>This step is crucial: before trying to figure out any of the deep mathematics behind the problem, write the dumbest thing that could work. You’re going to need it, anyway, to test your faster versions against, and besides, it might be good enough as-is!</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>def</span> sequence(n,m):</span>
<span id="cb3-2">    <span>while</span> n <span>!=</span> m:</span>
<span id="cb3-3">        <span>yield</span> (n,m)</span>
<span id="cb3-4">        <span>if</span> n <span>&lt;</span> m:</span>
<span id="cb3-5">            m <span>-=</span> n</span>
<span id="cb3-6">            n <span>*=</span> <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7">        <span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb3-8">            n <span>-=</span> m</span>
<span id="cb3-9">            m <span>*=</span> <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb3-10"></span>
<span id="cb3-11"><span>def</span> loops(xs):</span>
<span id="cb3-12">    seen <span>=</span> <span>set</span>()</span>
<span id="cb3-13">    <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> xs:</span>
<span id="cb3-14">        <span>if</span> x <span>in</span> seen:</span>
<span id="cb3-15">            <span>return</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb3-16">        <span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb3-17">            seen.add(x)</span>
<span id="cb3-18">    <span>return</span> <span>False</span></span>
<span id="cb3-19"></span>
<span id="cb3-20"><span>def</span> solution(n,m):</span>
<span id="cb3-21">    <span>return</span> loops(sequence(n,m))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first function actually generates the sequence we’re interested in: it uses python’s generators to do so. The second function is just a generic function that checks a sequence for duplicates. Finally, the last function answers the question we’re interested in.</p>

<p>Next, we want to try and spot some patterns in the answers the function generates. Remember, we’re not really interested in figuring out the theory at this point: if we find out that a loop only happens when both numbers are even (for instance), that’s good enough for us and we can stop there!</p>
<p>We humans are pattern-matching machines: to leverage our abilities, though, we will need to visualise the data somehow. In this case, I’m going to plot a simple scatter graph to the terminal, using the following code (I apologise for my terrible indentation style):</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>print</span>(</span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>.join(</span>
<span id="cb4-3">        <span>''</span>.join(</span>
<span id="cb4-4">            <span>'*'</span> <span>if</span> solution(x,y) <span>else</span> <span>' '</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">            <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>1</span>,<span>81</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-6">        )</span>
<span id="cb4-7">        <span>for</span> y <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>100</span>,<span>0</span>,<span>-</span><span>1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-8">    )</span>
<span id="cb4-9">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we get the following output:</p>

For basic forms, we suggest using Universal Automation. For advanced forms, we suggest using Universal Dashboard.</p><h2 id="basic-forms">Basic Forms</h2><p><a href="https://docs.ironmansoftware.com/automation/scripts#running-a-script-with-parameters">PowerShell Universal Automation</a> can create forms based on the param block of a PowerShell script. There is no need to layout or create a GUI based on your script. Universal Automation supports the following parameter types:</p><ul><li>String</li><li>Boolean</li><li>SwitchParameter</li><li>Enumeration</li><li>DateTime</li><li>Integer</li></ul><p>A form can be defined using a basic form such as the following.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>param</span>(
    $String,
    <span>[string]</span>$String2,
    <span>[boolean]</span>$Boolean,
    <span>[Switch]</span>$Switch,
    <span>[System.DayOfWeek]</span>$Enumeration,
    <span>[DateTime]</span>$DateTime,
    <span>[int]</span>$Integer
)

$String
$String2
$Switch
$Enumeration
$DatTime
$Integer
</code></pre></div><p>The resulting form will look like this.</p><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/parameters.png" alt=""></p><p>Enumeration values will provide a drop down list that the user can select from.</p><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/enum.png" alt=""></p><p>The date and time selector provides date and time pickers.</p><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/datetime.png" alt=""></p><p>The integer will produce a numeric selector.</p><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/int.png" alt=""></p><p>Mandatory parameters will be enforced in the UI. If you use a mandatory parameter, the user will not be able to submit the form without entering the value.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>param</span>(
    $String,
    [<span>Parameter</span>(<span>Mandatory</span>)]

You can define custom form fields, layouts, validation and processing. Dashboards also support more complex input components such as file upload buttons and sliders.</p><p>To build a basic form, add a new dashboard and define a new form. The <code>$EventData</code> parameter will provide a hashtable of all the form data that has been entered by the user. This example uses a single textbox named <code>txtUserName</code> and shows a toast when the user enters some data.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDDashboard -Title <span>'Form'</span> -Content {
    New-UDForm -Content {
        New-UDTextbox -Id <span>'txtUserName'</span> -Placeholder <span>'User Name'</span>
    } -OnSubmit {
        Show-UDToast -Message $EventData.txtUserName
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/form.gif" alt=""></p><p>You can use any of the <a href="https://docs.ironmansoftware.com/dashboard/components/inputs">input components</a> to enter data into your form. The ID of the component will be the property of the <code>$EventData</code> hashtable.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDDashboard -Title <span>'Form'</span> -Content {
    New-UDForm -Content {
        New-UDTextbox -Id <span>'txtUserName'</span> -Placeholder <span>'User Name'</span>
        New-UDSwitch -Id <span>'switch'</span>
        New-UDCheckbox -Id <span>'checkbox'</span>
        New-UDSlider -Id <span>'slider'</span>
    } -OnSubmit {
        Show-UDToast -Message $EventData.txtUserName
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/formfields.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="uploads">Uploads</h3><p>You can upload files using the <code>New-UDUpload</code> component. The file that is uploaded will provide a hashtable that contains the file name, a base64 string of the data and the content type, if it is available.</p><p>This example takes the file that is uploaded and saves it into the temp directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDDashboard -Title <span>'Form'</span> -Content {
    New-UDForm -Content {
        New-UDUpload -Id <span>'myFile'</span> -Text Upload
    } -OnSubmit {
        $Data = $Body | ConvertFrom-Json 
        $bytes = <span>[System.Convert]</span>::FromBase64String($Data.myFile.Data)
        <span>[System.IO.File]</span>::WriteAllBytes(<span>"$env:temp\</span>$($Data.myFile.Name)<span>"</span>, $bytes)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="formatting">Formatting</h3><p>Universal Dashboard supports custom formatting for UDForms. You can use the <code>New-UDGrid</code>, <code>New-UDRow</code> and <code>New-UDColumn</code> within the form’s content. In addition to custom formatting, you can include any other Universal Dashboard component within the forms content. This could include elements like images, chips and avatars.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDDashboard -Title <span>'Form'</span> -Content {
    New-UDForm -Content {
        New-UDRow -Columns {
            New-UDColumn -SmallSize 6 -Content {
                New-UDTextbox -Id <span>'txtUserName'</span> -Placeholder <span>'User Name'</span>

            New-UDColumn -SmallSize 6 -Content {
                New-UDSwitch -Id <span>'switch'</span>
            }
        }
        New-UDRow -Columns {
            New-UDColumn -SmallSize 6 -Content {
                New-UDCheckbox -Id <span>'checkbox'</span>
            }
            New-UDColumn -SmallSize 6 -Content {

    }
}
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/formsize.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="validation">Validation</h3><p>Form validation can be defined with the <code>OnValidate</code> event handler. You can use the <code>$EventData</code> variable to access the current state of the form. Just as with the <code>OnSubmit</code> event handler, the <code>$EventData</code> variable will have a property for each field in the form. You can return whether the form is valid or not using the <code>New-UDFormValidationResult</code> cmdlet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDDashboard -Title <span>'Form'</span> -Content {
    New-UDForm -Content {
        New-UDTextbox -Id <span>'txtValidateForm'</span>
    } -OnValidate {
        $FormContent = $EventData

        <span>if</span> ($FormContent.txtValidateForm <span>-eq</span> $null <span>-or</span> $FormContent.txtValidateForm <span>-eq</span> <span>''</span>) {
            New-UDFormValidationResult -ValidationError <span>"txtValidateForm is required"</span>

    }
}
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/formvalidation.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="returning-content">Returning Content</h3><p>Forms can return any type of Universal Dashboard content after processing. All you need to do is return a new component from the <code>OnSubmit</code> event handler.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDDashboard -Title <span>'Form'</span> -Content {
    New-UDForm -Content {
        New-UDTextbox -Id <span>'gif'</span> -Placeholder <span>'Giphy'</span>
    } -OnSubmit {
        New-UDImage -Url <span>"https://media.giphy.com/media/</span>$($EventData.gif)<span>/giphy.gif"</span>
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/formreturn.gif" alt=""></p><h3 id="stepper">Stepper</h3><p>The stepper control provides a wizard-like experience. You can define pages and validate pages based on the input on previous pages. You can access the <code>$Body</code> variable that contains the value of the current context of the stepper. The <code>$Body</code> variable is a JSON string that contains a context property that includes properties that have been set and the current page the user is on.</p><p>A basic stepper controller could look like this. With each step, the next step will display the previous step’s context. When the stepper is finished, the <code>OnFinish</code> event handler will be called. Just as with the <code>OnSubmit</code> event handler for UDForm, you can return content from <code>OnFinish</code> that will replace the stepper.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDDashboard -Title <span>'Form'</span> -Content {
    New-UDStepper -Steps {
        New-UDStep -OnLoad {
            New-UDElement -tag <span>'div'</span> -Content { <span>"Step 1"</span> }

}
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://blog.ironmansoftware.com/images/stepper.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="stepper-validation">Stepper Validation</h3><p>Much like form validation, you can use the <code>OnValidateStep</code> parameter to validate each step. The context will be provided to the event handler and you will be able to validate that step. Users will not be able to advance if the step is invalid.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">New-UDStepper -Steps {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Last time I wrote about <a href="https://www.tabbydata.com/2020/09/12/the-case-for-small-data/">why small startups might want to collect and use their data</a>. If you buy into the <em>why</em>, the next question you might ask is <em>how</em>?</p>

<p>At first glance, Amazon Athena sounds like it should be the holy grail of data warehouses for scrappy startups: dump any lightly-structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV) into S3 and then query it with SQL anytime. Unfortunately, that promise is rarely realized for small startups, because Athena and the ecosystem it belongs to basically don’t prioritize that audience. However, it <em>is</em> possible for tiny 1-, 2-, or 3-person startups to live the Athena dream! Here I will try to outline how.</p>

<p>If we break down the problem somewhat, there are actually a few separate problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data ingestion</li>
  <li>Data storage</li>
  <li>Data usage</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll address these in reverse order, because the requirements build on top of each other that way.</p>

<h2 id="data-usage">Data usage</h2>

<p>Athena is basically just a (barely) dressed-up version of <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a>. Presto is a standards-compliant SQL query engine, so you can more-or-less query it with anything that can query SQL. That makes using the data in Athena really easy, but there are a few gotchas around performance and (very relatedly) cost.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The most important consideration when querying large tables in Presto is minimizing the data that needs to be scanned by the system, and the most straightforward way of doing this is by making sure your queries always include partition values. This leads to a storage constraint: <strong>tables must have partitions!</strong></li>
  <li>Another important consideration, which Amazon does not document very well at all, is the <em>number of files</em> that will be scanned by the system. This is very different from the <em>size of the data</em> that will be scanned; after all, 1GB of data might be one file or it might be 1 million; reading the former from S3 costs $0.0000004 while reading the latter costs $0.40. There is no way to control this at query-time, so this introduces another storage constraint: <strong>tables must be distributed amongst fewer files where possible.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This is at odds with the first constraint, and is part of the reason why complicated file formats like Parquet exist. More on this in the storage section below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Even when partitions are referenced, it’s possible to construct queries in Presto that run very inefficiently. In practice, I have not found this to be much of a problem, but from time to time it is necessary to optimize. Searching Google for “optimizing Presto queries” returns lots of useful goodies like <a href="https://www.doorda.com/how-to-guides/query-optimization-for-presto-on-doordahost/">this</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-storage">Data storage</h2>

<p>Ok, so we want to keep costs low and queries performant by… partitioning data into separate files as much as we can while also… not having more files than we need? Basically, yes. In practice, it helps to not overthink this. The rules of thumb that I recommend are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All data entries should be represented as either events (things that happened at a specific time) or objects (usually mapping to domain objects in your application, like a user or an inventory item, and having an ID).</li>
  <li>All events should be partitioned based on the time that they occurred, bucketed into days.</li>
  <li>All objects should be bucketed into ~200 partitions based on a hash of the ID.</li>
  <li>Files in a partition should be allowed to grow to about 100MB before adding a new file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Athena is very flexible about file formats (it would even allow you to define your own serialization logic) but in my opinion there are three mainstream options:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>CSV.</strong> Generally fine, but I’m inclined to avoid because it doesn’t work well with more complicated data types (e.g. Presto supports columns with array values, but I don’t want to think about how to encode that in CSV).</li>
  <li><strong>JSON.</strong> Tried and true.</li>
  <li><strong>Apache ORC or Apache Parquet.</strong> These are two separate file formats, but I’m grouping them together as “fancy binary formats that solve a lot of problems, but introduce a few of their own.” Specifically, these are <em>column-oriented</em> formats, which is neat because it means <code>SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz=3</code> will only scane the <code>foo</code> and <code>baz</code> columns in the <code>bar</code> table, instead of scanning all the columns, saving both time and money. (This is basically like another dimension of partitioning.) The main downside, however, is that generating these files is less straightforward and usually requires using things like Apache Spark, which (a) represent too much of a distraction for tiny startups, if they’re not already skilled in it, and (b) don’t support real-time updates very well.</li>
</ol>

<p>Speaking of real-time updates: ideally, data would be added to the data warehouse almost immediately after it’s produced, so that you can use it right away. This is non-trivial, but easier for most programmers to reason about and implement using CSV/JSON vs the binary formats. At scale, the binary formats end up being really worthwhile, but early on the costs to be concerned about are dominated by people-hours rather than infrastructure expenses. The CSV/JSON approach will easily scale up to several terabytes, especially if they’re compressed (Athena supports a variety of compression formats, including gzip).</p>

<h2 id="data-ingestion">Data ingestion</h2>

<p>Collecting data and adding it to our Athena tables is the complicated part, informed by the requirements discovered above. We want to create tables containing events and objects, partitioned by date or ID, which update in close to real-time. At a very high level, it will look something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integration points (e.g. parts of application code that wish to emit an event) place new data entries into a queue. The queue is sharded by event or object type (this is implemented as a “message group ID” in SQS FIFO queues).</li>
  <li>Workers (e.g. Lambda functions) process the queue. Unfortunately, S3 does not expose any way of simply appending to a file, so we need to overwrite files instead. The worker determines the file path based on event/object type and partition ID, then inserts a file if it does not exist or modifies it (adding a row) if it does. If the last file is larger than 100 MB, it starts a new file.
    <ul>
      <li>I’ve also seen and used an approach which uses SQL <code>INSERT INTO</code> statements at this point, via Athena, rather than mutating S3 files directly. This works, but will end up violating our file-size requirement and result in unnecessarily high query costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it! I should be clear that this is not the “normal” way of using Athena; it’s customized based on what I’ve seen work well for very small startups. The “normal” way involves things like AWS Glue and Hive/Hadoop/Spark/Flink/etc; most existing resources for using Athena are centered on that approach. I’ve focused on the approach described above because I think it’s more approachable (in terms of total cost) than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="cost-modeling">Cost modeling</h2>

<p>I’ve referenced cost a few times above. In a future post I’ll present a cost model based on each aspect—ingestion, storage, and usage.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the first</a> and <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the second</a> parts of this series we explored the ideas behind the execution and the compilation of a Python program. We'll continue to focus on ideas in the next parts but this time we'll make an exception and look at the actual code that brings those ideas to life. </p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<p>The CPython codebase is around 350,000 lines of C code (excluding header files) and almost 600,000 lines of Python code. Undoubtedly, it would be a daunting task to comprehend all of that at once. So, today we'll confine our study to that part of the source code that executes every time we run <code>python</code>. We'll start with the <code>main()</code> function of the <code>python</code> executable and step through the source code until we reach the evaluation loop, a place where the Python bytecode gets executed.</p>
<p>Our goal is not to understand every piece of code we'll encounter but to highlight the most interesting parts, study them, and, eventually, get an approximate idea of what happens at the very start of the execution of a Python program.</p>
<p>There are two more notices I should make. First, we won't step into every function. We'll make only a high-level overview of some parts and dive deep into others. Nevertheless, I promise to present functions in the order of execution. Second, with the exception of a few struct definitions, I'll leave the code as is. The only thing I'll allow myself is to add some comments and to rephrase existing ones. Throughout this post, all multi-line <code>/**/</code> comments are original, and all single-line <code>//</code> comments are mine. With that said, let's begin our journey through the CPython source code.</p>
<h3>Getting CPython</h3>
<p>Before we can explore the source code, we need to get it. Let's clone the CPython repository:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/python/cpython/ &amp;&amp; cd cpython
</pre></div>


<p>The current <code>master</code> branch is the future CPython 3.10. We're interested in the latest stable release, which is CPython 3.9, so let's switch to the <code>3.9</code> branch:</p>



<p>Inside the root directory we find the following contents:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ls -p
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md      Objects/                config.sub
Doc/                    PC/                     configure
Grammar/                PCbuild/                configure.ac
Include/                Parser/                 install-sh
LICENSE                 Programs/               m4/
Lib/                    Python/                 netlify.toml
Mac/                    README.rst              pyconfig.h.in
Makefile.pre.in         Tools/                  setup.py
Misc/                   aclocal.m4
Modules/                config.guess
</pre></div>


<p>Some of the listed subdirectories are of particular importance to us in the course of this series:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Grammar/</code> contains the grammar files we discussed last time.</li>
<li><code>Include/</code> contains header files. These header files are used both by CPython and by the users of the <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/Python/C%20API">Python/C API</a>.</li>
<li><code>Lib/</code> contains standard library modules written in Python. While some modules, such as <code>argparse</code> and <code>wave</code>, are written in Python entirely, many wrap C code. For example, the Python <code>io</code> module  wraps the C <code>_io</code> module.</li>
<li><code>Modules/</code> contains standard library modules written in C. While some modules, such as <code>itertools</code>, are intended to be imported directly, others are wrapped by the Python modules.</li>
<li><code>Objects/</code> contains the implementations of the built-in types. If you want to understand how <code>int</code> or <code>list</code> are implemented, this is the ultimate place to go to.</li>
<li><code>Parser/</code> contains the old parser, the old parser generator, the new parser and the tokenizer.</li>
<li><code>Programs/</code> contains source files that are compiled to executables. </li>
<li><code>Python/</code> contains source files for the interpreter itself. This includes the compiler, the evaluation loop, the <code>builtins</code> module and many other interesting things.</li>
<li><code>Tools/</code> contains tools useful for building and managing CPython. For example, the new parser generator lives here.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't see a directory for tests, and your heart starts beating faster, relax. It's <code>Lib/test/</code>. Tests can be useful not only for CPython development but also for getting an understanding of how CPython works. For example, to understand what kinds of optimization the peephole optimizer is expected to do, you can go to <code>Lib/test/test_peepholer.py</code> and look. And to understand what some piece of code of the peephole optimizer does, you can delete that piece of code, recompile CPython, run </p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ./python.exe -m test test_peepholer
</pre></div>


<p>and see which tests fail.</p>
<p>In the ideal world, all we need to do to compile CPython is to run <code>./configure</code> and <code>make</code>:</p>






<p><code>make</code> will produce an executable named <code>python</code>, but don't be surprised to see <code>python.exe</code> on Mac OS. The <code>.exe</code> extension is used to distinguish the executable from the <code>Python/</code> directory on the case-insensitive filesystem. Check out the Python Developer's Guide for <a href="https://devguide.python.org/setup/#compiling">more information on compiling</a>.</p>
<p>At this point we can proudly say that we've built our own copy of CPython:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ./python.exe
Python 3.9.0+ (heads/3.9-dirty:20bdeedfb4, Oct 10 2020, 16:55:24)
[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.10.44.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 ** 16
65536
</pre></div>


<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>The execution of CPython, like execution of any other C program, starts with the <code>main()</code> function in <code>Python/python.c</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>/* Minimal main program -- everything is loaded from the library */</span>

<span>#include</span> <span>"Python.h"</span><span></span>

<span>#ifdef MS_WINDOWS</span>
<span>int</span>
<span>wmain</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>wchar_t</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Py_Main</span><span>(</span><span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>argv</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#else</span>
<span>int</span>
<span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Py_BytesMain</span><span>(</span><span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>argv</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There isn't much going on there. The only thing worth mentioning is that on Windows CPython uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/using-wmain?view=vs-2019"><code>wmain()</code></a> instead of <code>main()</code> as an entrypoint to receive <code>argv</code> as <code>UTF-16</code> encoded strings. The affect of this is that on other platforms CPython performs an extra step of converting a <code>char</code> string to a <code>wchar_t</code> string. The encoding of a <code>char</code> string depends on the locale settings, and the encoding of a <code>wchar_t</code> string depends on the size of <code>wchar_t</code>. For example, if <code>sizeof(wchar_t) == 4</code>, the <code>UCS-4</code> encoding is used. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0383/">PEP 383</a> has more to say on this.</p>
<p>We find <code>Py_Main()</code> and <code>Py_BytesMain()</code> in <code>Modules/main.c</code>. What they do is essentially call <code>pymain_main()</code> with slightly different arguments:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span>
<span>Py_Main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>wchar_t</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>_PyArgv</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>.</span><span>argc</span> <span>=</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>use_bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>wchar_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>argv</span><span>};</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pymain_main</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>int</span>
<span>Py_BytesMain</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>_PyArgv</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>.</span><span>argc</span> <span>=</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>use_bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>argv</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>wchar_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>};</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pymain_main</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We should stop on <code>pymain_main()</code> for a little bit longer, though, at the first sight, it doesn't seem to do much either:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>static</span> <span>int</span>
<span>pymain_main</span><span>(</span><span>_PyArgv</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>PyStatus</span> <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>pymain_init</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_PyStatus_IS_EXIT</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>pymain_free</span><span>();</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>status</span><span>.</span><span>exitcode</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_PyStatus_EXCEPTION</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>pymain_exit_error</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>Py_RunMain</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Last time we learned that before a Python program starts executing, CPython does a lot of things to compile it. It turns out that CPython does a lot of things even before it starts compiling a program. These things constitute the initialization of CPython. As we already said in the first part, CPython works in three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>initialization</li>
<li>compilation; and</li>
<li>interpretation.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what <code>pymain_main()</code> does is call <code>pymain_init()</code> to perform the initialization and then call <code>Py_RunMain()</code> to proceed with the next stages. The question remains: what does CPython do during the initialization? Let's ponder on this for a moment. At the very least CPython has to:</p>
<ul>
<li>find a common language with the OS to handle properly the encodings of arguments, environment variables, standard streams and the file system</li>
<li>parse the command line arguments and read the environment variables to determine the options to run with</li>
<li>initialize the runtime state, the main interpreter state and the main thread state</li>
<li>initialize built-in types and the <code>builtins</code> module</li>
<li>initialize the <code>sys</code> module</li>
<li>set up the import system</li>
<li>create the <code>__main__</code> module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we step into <code>pymain_init()</code> to see how all of that is done, let's discuss the initialization process in more detail.</p>
<h4>initialization</h4>
<p>Starting with CPython 3.8, the initialization is done in three distinct phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>preinitialization</li>
<li>core initialization; and</li>
<li>main initialization.</li>
</ol>
<p>The phases gradually introduce new capabilities. The preinitialization phase initializes the runtime state, sets up the default memory allocator and performs very basic configuration. There is no sign of Python yet. The core initialization phase initializes the main interpreter state and the main thread state, built-in types and exceptions, the <code>builtins</code> module, the <code>sys</code> module and the import system. At this point, you can use the "core" of Python. However, some things are not available yet. For example, the <code>sys</code> module is only partially initialized, and only the import of built-in and frozen modules is supported. After the main initialization phase the CPython is fully initialized and ready to compile and execute a Python program.</p>
<p>What's the benefit of having distinct initialization phases? In a nutshell, it allows to tune CPython more easily. For example, one may set a custom memory allocator in the <code>preinitialized</code> state or override the path configuration in the <code>core_initialized</code> state. Of course, CPython itself doesn't need to tune anything. Such capabilities are important to the users of the Python/C API who extend and embed Python. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0432/">PEP 432</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0587/">PEP 587</a> explain in greater detail why having multi-phase initialization is a good idea.</p>
<p><code>pymain_init()</code> mostly deals with the preinitialization and calls <code>Py_InitializeFromConfig()</code> in the end to perform the core and the main phases of the initialization:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>static</span> <span>PyStatus</span>
<span>pymain_init</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>_PyArgv</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>PyStatus</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Initialize the runtime state</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>_PyRuntime_Initialize</span><span>();</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_PyStatus_EXCEPTION</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// Initialize default preconfig</span>
    <span>PyP…</span></pre></div></div></div>

                  <p><a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/spatial-reality-display/elf-sr1">Sony recently announced a new 15.6-inch 4K display</a> that includes eye tracking and an imbedded lenticular lens array that will allow users to view 3D content without the use of glasses.</p><p>The Spatial Reality Display is priced at $5,000 and is due to release to the public in November. The display will let users observed 3D rendered content without a VR Headset or 3D glasses.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrLMnQM0_Ps?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Due to the nature of the eye tracking technology, the display is limited to a single person. The full 3D effect can only be viewed one at a time.</p><p>This viewing experience is made possible by a high-speed sensor that tracks eye movement and automatically adjusts the screen as the user’s head moves around the image. Sony claims that this will allow 3D images to <em>“appear as smooth as in real life, even if you move around.”</em></p><p>The screen itself is layered with a micro optical lens and split in half, dividing the image into the right and left eyes for stereoscopic viewing.</p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/srd-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/srd-2.jpg 600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/srd-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/srd-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You are going to need a very powerful PC to run the display, the processing power needed to track the user, update the image in real time, and split the screen into two 2K displays will require at least a modern Intel Core i7 CPU and NVIDIA's RTX 2070 Super GPU. If you want to take advantage of the device, it will require a considerable investment.</p><p>However, while the display will be offered to the public, it’s clear that it was designed with businesses in mind. Sony has already made the technology available to companies like the Ghostbusters production studio, Ghost Corp, Volkswagen, and according to Sony, <em>“one of the largest architectural firms in the world.”</em></p><p>Sony has an SDK for both Unity and Unreal Engine 4 which will facilitate the transfer of VR content to the display but according to both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/15/21518679/sony-spacial-reality-display-hands-on-holographic-elf-sr1">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-spatial-reality-display-3d-glasses-free-010029316.html">Engadget</a>, the product is still in its infancy and the illusion is easy to break.</p>

<p>There are different weights of JuliaMono, so you can control the amount of contrast you have in your highlighted code: <span>JuliaMono-Light</span>, JuliaMono-Regular, <span>JuliaMono-Medium</span>, <span>JuliaMono-Bold</span>, <span>JuliaMono-ExtraBold</span>, and <span>JuliaMono-Black</span>. <sup id="fnref:masters"><a href="#fndef:masters">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>(There are also versions of two of the fonts with “Latin” in the name: these are stripped down versions supporting just the basic MacRoman/Windows1252 “Latin” character sets, intended for use as place-holders, of interest mainly if you want to have more control over font loading times in web browser-based applications.)</p>
<p>In the hands of a virtuoso (such as Dr Zygmunt Szpak, the author of the following Julia code fragment<sup id="fnref:zscode"><a href="#fndef:zscode">[4]</a></sup>), the range of available Unicode characters can be quite expressive:</p>

<p>One of the goals of JuliaMono is to include most of the characters that a typical programmer would reasonably expect to find. (Except for all those emojis - they are best handled by the operating system.) Here’s a thousand or so chosen at random:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicode-sample.svg" width="100%" alt="Unicode sampler"></p><p>In JuliaMono, every character is the same width, because this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced</a> typeface. Usually, typefaces with a lot of Unicode mathematical symbols are not monospaced, because they’re intended for use in prose and \( \LaTeX \) applications, rather than in programming code.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, forcing every character into the same size box is a problem. It’s like fitting every human being of whatever shape or size into identical airplane seats - some characters are bound to look uncomfortable. There’s never quite enough room for a nice-looking “m” or “w”.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Evizero/UnicodePlots.jl">UnicodePlots.jl</a> uses various Unicode characters to plot figures directly in a terminal window. <sup id="fnref:linespacing"><a href="#fndef:linespacing">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicodeplots.png" alt="UnicodePlots in action"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageInTerminal.jl">ImageInTerminal.jl</a> is similarly awesome, conjuring images from Unicode characters:</p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/imageinterminal.png" alt="ImageInTerminal"></p><p>JuliaMono is quite greedy<sup id="fnref:greedy"><a href="#fndef:greedy">[7]</a></sup>, and contains a lot of Unicode glyphs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/barchart.svg" width="100%" alt="silly barchart"></p><p>(Of course, size isn’t everything - quality can beat quantity, and other fonts will offer different experiences<sup id="fnref:otherfonts"><a href="#fndef:otherfonts">[8]</a></sup>).</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to support box-drawing characters and DataFrames.jl output (terminal permitting):</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; df = DataFrame(A=samples, B=glyphs)
df = 10×2 DataFrame
│ Row │ A              │ B                   │

<p>(Can you spot the little used and sadly mathematically-unsupported "times" character?)</p>
<p>If you want to know whether you can use a Unicode character as an identifier in your Julia code, use the undocumented function <code>Base.isidentifier()</code>. So, for example, if you have the urge to use a dingbat (one of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapf_Dingbats">Herman Zapf dingbat</a> designs), you could look for something suitable in the output of this:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; for n in 0x2700:0x27bf
			Base.isidentifier(string(Char(n))) &amp;&amp; print(Char(n))
	   end

<p>JuliaMono is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType</a> typeface. OpenType technology provides powerful text positioning, pattern matching, and glyph substitution features, which are essential for languages such as Arabic and Urdu. In English, OpenType features are often seen when letter pairs such as <span>fi</span> in certain fonts are replaced by a single glyph such as <span>ﬁ</span>. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature">ligatures</a> have been used ever since printing with moveable type was invented, replacing the occasional awkward character combination with a better-looking alternative.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not a big fan of their use in coding fonts (and I’m not the only one<sup id="fnref:nottheonlyone"><a href="#fndef:nottheonlyone">[9]</a></sup>). I like to see exactly what I’ve typed, rather than what the font has decided to replace it with. But, there are a few places in Julia where suitable Unicode alternatives are not accepted by the language, and where I feel that the ASCII-art confections currently used can be gently enhanced by the judicious use of alternate glyphs. There are also a few places where some subtle tweaks can enhance the readability of the language without introducing ambiguity.</p>
<p>In JuliaMono, the following substitutions are applied when the <strong>contextual alternates</strong> feature is active:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
    <th><p>typed</p></th>
    <th><p>displayed</p></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>-&gt;</td>
    <td>-&gt;</td>

<p>The vacation rental platform Airbnb, Inc. is bracing for an initial public offering (IPO) targeted for December 2020, despite the significant impact wrought on its business and the travel and tourism industry more generally by the coronavirus pandemic</p>



<p>The San Francisco-based company is aiming to raise some US$3 billion in its IPO. Airbnb’s public offering comes after the company laid off a quarter of its workforce earlier in the year and was forced to seek new avenues of funding to keep the business afloat.</p>



<p>Yet, despite the difficulties it faced at the height of the pandemic, Airbnb’s business has rebounded quicker than expected. Investors and executives alike are keen to begin the IPO process as soon as possible, which could provide the company with extra capital and a higher valuation, perhaps undoing the damage caused by lockdown orders and a global shutdown in travel and tourism.</p>



<p>With a travel and tourism industry that’s still in tatters and a virus yet to be fully brought under control, Airbnb’s IPO still has significant uncertainty with which to deal with.</p>



<p>Coronavirus rebound<br>With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic around the world, Airbnb faced an unprecedented challenge to its business operations.</p>



<p>With lockdown orders and the decline in global travel and tourism, Airbnb’s core business, its popular short-term home rentals for vacationers and travelers, was under immediate jeopardy.</p>



<p>In response to the pandemic, Airbnb allowed its customers in March to cancel their bookings without penalties, while also providing hosts financial support that accounted for some of the revenue lost by future guests canceling their bookings with no penalties.</p>



<p>In addition, the company secured funding from private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners, raising US$1 billion in debt from the two firms. Silver Lake co-chief executive officer Egon Durban claimed the funding was not a “bailout,” but a strategic investment in “Airbnb’s diverse, global, and resilient business model.”</p>



<p>With the massive drop in bookings, with cancellations amounting to around US$1 billion in lost revenue, Airbnb executives were nonetheless forced to make cuts. In May, the home-rental platform announced it was laying off around 1,900 of it’s 7,500 strong global workforce, about 25%.</p>



<p>The announced layoffs were mostly concentrated in Airbnb’s noncore products, such as its transportation, Airbnb Studios, hotels and lux efforts.</p>



<p>In cutting back these sectors it had hoped to expand its operations into, Airbnb was focusing on its core product: short-term home rentals, particularly in rural areas away from coronavirus hot spots and cities, that were within driving distance.</p>



<p>This strategy largely worked. Despite laying off thousands of its workers, Airbnb’s focus on providing short-term home rentals saw bookings slowly increase once more, especially as customers were unwilling to patronize hotels in proximity to large numbers of other people.</p>



<p>In the midst of the pandemic, Airbnb touted its strengths in continuing to provide an experience for customers that was both safe and enjoyable. The ability of guests to rent a home solely for themselves and a spotlight on new coronavirus cleaning guidelines, with more than one million listings declared as possessing an “Enhanced Clean” certification in August, was largely responsible for the slow uptick in Airbnb bookings.</p>



<p>Airbnb’s slow rebound mirrored a broader resilience in the tech industry. Despite the pandemic and subsequent economic crisis, funding for tech startups continued to flow. In the second quarter of 2020, startups in the United States raised some US$34.3 billion, down only slightly from the US$36 billion the previous year.</p>



<p>According to Airbnb co-founder and chief executive Brian Cheksy, Airbnb’s gradual recovery, despite the broader collapse in travel and tourism, showed that “people want to travel, they just don’t want to get on airplanes … they don’t want to go for business.”</p>



<p>What they did want, however, was the ability to stay away from home, but away from other people, a service that put Airbnb ahead of traditional hotel rivals during the pandemic.</p>



<p>With its recovery ongoing, the hopes of an Airbnb IPO in 2020 seem to be reignited. In 2019, the company promised it would go public in 2020 and despite the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, this promise appears largely on track to being met.</p>



<p>In August, the home-rental platform confidentially filed to go public, joining an ongoing deluge of tech startups filing to go public in 2020, such as the data company Palantir Technologies Inc. and delivery platform DoorDash Inc.</p>



<p>It has not been an easy year for Airbnb, by any metrics. On top of its spring layoffs, the company reported a US$400 million adjusted loss in the second quarter of 2020 and its company valuation, which once topped over US$30 billion, declined to around US$18 billion.</p>



<p>But the company hopes to now take advantage of the tech IPO frenzy, pull in new capital to pay off its debts raised during the pandemic and reward early Airbnb employees and investors who have been waiting nearly a decade to cash out.</p>



<p>The company hopes to raise around US$3 billion through an IPO, which could potentially boost the platform’s valuations back to its pre-coronavirus numbers.</p>



<p>Uncertain future<br>Airbnb’s executives can point to several talking points to demonstrate why it remains an attractive investment opportunity. In 2017 and 2018 the company turned a profit on earnings before interest, taxes and expenses and guest numbers have continued to rise over the last few years. Company spending has also been streamlined, with Airbnb’s marketing budget cut by 14% in the first quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year basis.</p>



<p>Despite its confidence, Airbnb’s planned IPO still faces an uncertain world. International travel (which is directly connected to Airbnb’s core business) is not expected to return to 2019 levels until 2023 and the fate of the US economy remains uncertain, for the time being, with second stimulus talks remaining stuck.</p>



<p>Regardless of the uncertainty, Airbnb’s IPO remains one of the most anticipated in recent years. As Airbnb investor Zach Aarons told Bloomberg, “Airbnb is a very recognizable name; people know it like they know Coca Cola.” Investors will soon see just how much this name recognition is worth.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3><div><p>On June 11, 2020, an AI research and deployment company OpenAI – founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others – announced its revolutionary language model, GPT-3. The news quickly created buzz in tech circles with demo videos of early GPT-3 prototypes going viral on Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News.</p><p>Not everyone can access the GPT-3 API, though – at least just yet. To keep improving the model and its safety in a controlled setting, OpenAI has introduced a waitlist where people can apply for early access. According to an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-gpt-3-everything-business-needs-to-know-about-openais-breakthrough-ai-language-program/" target="_blank">article by ZDNet</a> in late August, OpenAI had already <em>"gotten tens of thousands of applications for API access to date"</em>, and was being <em>"judicious about access as they learn just what these models can do in the real world"</em>.</p><p>4 months after its initial launch, the API remains in private beta – however, OpenAI continues to selectively invite people into its beta program.<br>‍</p></div><h3><strong>1. Application form</strong></h3><figure id="w-node-7d0e1d186a9a-1c6bbce1"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/5f8707f1519d0f0d73631cde_Screenshot%202020-10-12%20at%2016.13.29.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><br>The first thing was to send an application on OpenAI's official <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30" target="_blank">API Waitlist form</a>. The form is fairly simple and basically only asks about your intended use case:</p><blockquote><em>Provide a brief description of the way that you or your organization might want to use the API (or if you're not sure, describe your current product or service). Where applicable, please include any initial thoughts you have around potential benefits or risks from your use case, or any other information that you'd like us to know.</em></blockquote><p><br>The point about benefits and risks is important. With 10 000s of people on the waitlist, which use cases would you prioritize if you were in OpenAI's shoes?</p><p><br>While we don't know the exact answer, our best guess is those that have the potential to either:</p><ol role="list"><li>Become significant in size (and thereby, a relevant revenue source for OpenAI)</li><li>Make a positive impact on society (instead of producing e.g. hateful, political or racist content), or</li><li>Benefit the development of the API in some way (in terms of e.g. safety or accuracy)</li></ol><p><br>Regarding the length of the answer, ours was roughly 200 words. Answer the questions thoroughly while keeping it concise.<br>‍</p><h3><strong>2. Outreach</strong></h3><p>We soon realized that the application itself was not going to do the job. Since we wanted to move fast, waiting for months to get our hands on the API was out of the question, and we started looking for ways to speed up the process.</p><p>First, we found plenty of Tweets like these:</p><figure id="w-node-07c444930544-1c6bbce1"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/5f870825d07ffb27ff6ca27a_Screenshot%202020-10-12%20at%2013.28.43.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>Apparently, there was a chance to get access by emailing Greg Brockman (OpenAI CTO). So we did that (a couple of times actually). We also emailed others in the organization, however, we don't necessarily recommend doing so; a much better use of your time is to target only one person with a crystal clear and well-thought-out proposition.</p><p>If you decide to go with this approach, you might want to consider mentioning:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Why the idea is important to you and how people can benefit from it</li><li>How OpenAI can benefit from it</li><li>Your background with links to your profiles and/or portfolio<br>‍</li></ul><h3><strong>3. Stand out</strong></h3><p>For us, the key to obtaining access was eventually to do something special and get noticed by the folks at OpenAI. If you don't receive access with the above methods, our suggestion is to do something that shows your enthusiasm and gets OpenAI excited about you and your use case.</p><p>There are countless ways to go about this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Bakz T.

<![CDATA[What is the PDP-11 instruction set?]]>

October 18, 2020 | http://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp11/faq/faq.pages/PDPinst.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp11/faq/faq.pages/PDPinst.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
     The instruction set of the PDP-11 was designed towards a clean,
     general, symmetric instruction set.  It can be used as a
     register-based, stack-based, or memory-based machine, depending
     on the programmer's preferences.  Interrupt responsiveness is
     also important, supported with multiple interrupt levels for
     real-time computing as well as allowing for a separate interrupt
     handler for each device that generates interrupts.
</p><p>
     Word length is 16 bits with the leftmost, most significant bit
     (MSB) being bit 15.  There are eight general registers of 16 bits
     each.  Register 7 is the program counter (PC) and, by convention,
     Register 6 is the stack pointer (SP).  There is also a Processor
     Status Register/Word (PSW) which indicates the 4 condition code
     bits (N, Z, V, C), the Trace Trap bit, processor interrupt
     priority, and 4 bits for current and previous operating modes.
     Addressing on the -11 is linear from memory address 0 through
     177777.  Memory management allows access to physical memory with
     addresses of up to 22 bits (17777777).  All I/O devices,
     registers etc are addressed as if they were part of memory.
     These live in the 4KW of reserved memory space at the top of the
     addressing range.  Additionally, on most implementations of the
     PDP-11 architecture, the processor's registers are memory-mapped
     to the range 17777700-17777717 (there are many control registers
     beyond just the general registers, the specifics vary between
     implementations).  Thus Register 2 (R2) has an address of
     17777702.  All word memory addresses are even, except for registers.
     In byte operations, an even address specifies the least-significant
     byte and an odd address specifies the most-significant byte.
     Specifying an odd byte in a word operation will return an odd
     address trap.  Memory addresses from 0 to 400 octal are reserved
     for various exception traps such as timeouts, reserved
     instructions, parity, etc., and device interrupts.
</p><p>
     Addressing for the Single Operand, Double Operand and
     Jump instructions is achieved via six bits:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|_|_|_|
                         |Mode |Reg  |
</pre><p>
     where the modes are as follows: (Reg = Register, Def = Deferred)
</p><pre>     Mode 0  Reg           Direct addressing of the register
     Mode 1  Reg Def       Contents of Reg is the address
     Mode 2  AutoIncr      Contents of Reg is the address, then Reg incremented
     Mode 3  AutoIncrDef   Content of Reg is addr of addr, then Reg Incremented
     Mode 4  AutoDecr      Reg is decremented then contents is address
     Mode 5  AutoDecrDef   Reg is decremented then contents is addr of addr
     Mode 6  Index         Contents of Reg + Following word is address
     Mode 7  IndexDef      Contents of Reg + Following word is addr of addr
</pre><p>
     Note that the right-most bit of the mode is an indirection bit.
</p><p>
     Although not special cases, when dealing with R7 (aka the PC), some of
     these operations are called different things:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|1|1|1|
                         |Mode |  R7 |

     Mode 2  Immediate     Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 3  Absolute      Address of Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 6  Relative      Instr address+4+Next word is Address
     Mode 7  RelativeDef   Instr address+4+Next word is Address of address
</pre><p>
     Mainstream instructions are broken into Single operand and Double
     operand instructions, which in turn can be word or byte instructions.
</p>
<h2>Double Operand Instructions</h2>
<pre>                      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                     |b|i|i|i|s|s|s|s|s|s|d|d|d|d|d|d|
                     | |     |     :     |     :     |
                     | | Op  | Source    |  Dest     |
</pre><p>
     Bit 15, b, generally selects between word-sized (b=0) and
     byte-sized (b=1) operands.  In the table below, the mnemonics and
     names are given in the order b=0/b=1.
</p><p>
     The double operand instructions are:
</p><dl>
          <dt>b 000 ssssss dddddd
              </dt><dd>Non-double-operand instructions.
</dd><dt>b 001 ssssss dddddd -- MOV/MOVB  <i>Move Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Moves a value from source to destination.
</dd><dt>b 010 ssssss dddddd -- CMP/CMPB  <i>Compare Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Compares values by subtracting the destination
              from the source, setting the condition codes, and
              then discarding the result of the subtraction.
</dd><dt>b 011 ssssss dddddd -- BIT/BITB  <i>Bit Test Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Performs a bit-wise AND of the source and the
              destination, sets the condition codes, and then
              discards the result of the AND.
</dd><dt>b 100 ssssss dddddd -- BIC/BICB  <i>Bit Clear Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>For each bit set in the source, that bit is cleared
              in the destination.  This is accomplished by taking the
              ones-complement of the source and ANDing it with the
              destination.  The result of the AND is stored in the
              destination.
</dd><dt>b 101 ssssss dddddd -- BIS/BISB  <i>Bit Set Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>For each bit set in the source, that bit is set in
              the destination.  This is accomplished by ORing the
              source and destination, and storing the result in the
              destination.
</dd><dt>b 110 ssssss dddddd -- ADD/SUB   <i>Add/Subtract Word</i>

          <dt>b 000 000 011 dddddd -- SWAB/BPL   <i>Swap Bytes/Branch Plus</i>
              </dt><dd>Swap bytes exchanges the two bytes found in the
              destination, writing the result back to it.
<p>
              The branch (b=1) is described in the section on
              branches, below.
</p><p>
              Note that SWAB is actually a bit pattern from the
              range reserved for branches.  This particular
              pattern is otherwise unused, as it would be a
              modification of BR, Branch Always, which has no
              obvious semantics.
</p></dd><dt>b 000 101 000 dddddd -- CLR/CLRB   <i>Clear Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Sets all the bits in destination to zero.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 001 dddddd -- COM/COMB   <i>Complement Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Calculates the ones-complement of the operand,
              and stores it.  The ones-complement is formed by
              inverting each bit (0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0) independently.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 010 dddddd -- INC/INCB   <i>Increment Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Adds one to the destination.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 011 dddddd -- DEC/DECB   <i>Decrement Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Subtracts one from the destination.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 100 dddddd -- NEG/NEGB   <i>Negate Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Calculates the twos-complement of the operand,
              and stores it.  The twos-complement is formed by
              adding one to the ones-complement.  The effect is
              the same as subtracting the operand from zero.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 101 dddddd -- ADC/ADCB   <i>Add Carry Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Adds the current value of the carry flag to the

		</div><p>BERLIN — The European Union aims to spend up to €10 billion over the next seven years to help build up a homegrown cloud computing sector that could rival foreign corporations such as Amazon, Google and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Twenty-five EU countries signed a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-next-generation-cloud-europe" target="_blank">joint declaration</a> Thursday pledging public money to power up the cloud sector and establishing the "European Alliance on Industrial Data and Cloud," a partnership geared toward facilitating such projects.</p>
<p>The alliance — whose funding is to be drawn from existing EU programs and hoped-for pledges from industry and national capitals — will be launched by the end of the year. Cyprus and Denmark were the only EU member countries not to sign the declaration due to “technical reasons.”</p>
<p>The declaration “is a foundation stone for the establishment of European cloud technology, which will be very high performing,” said Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, following a meeting of European telecoms ministers organized by the German government, which currently holds the EU’s rotating Council presidency.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the prejudices, we are not late [on cloud development]. We are the first to get involved in the industrial cloud,” he added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services” — <em>Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The cloud alliance is a key part of the European Commission’s data strategy, which aims to create a single market for industrial data. Commissioner Breton in particular has lobbied hard to make the EU a worldwide data hub, and to develop data processing capabilities that would give Europe an edge over foreign rivals that currently dominate the cloud business.</p>
<p>It also fits in with broader efforts by European policymakers to make the Continent less dependent on foreign technology. Currently, U.S. technology firms dominate the global market for cloud storage.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the bloc is set to unveil by December a rulebook for platforms dubbed the “Digital Services Act," as well as binding laws for artificial intelligence that are set to be released early next year.</p>
<p>The new alliance will have the mandate to develop business, investment and implementation plans for European cloud technologies in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Signatories also pledge to create common European standards and policy norms to create pan-European cloud services, and help small and medium-sized businesses, startups and the public sector embrace cloud technology.</p>
<p>“In order to achieve digital sovereignty, we need to start approaching data processing the way major American and Chinese companies — the hyper-scalers — approach it,” said German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.</p>
<p>“This is an area where we’re far from being equals,” he added.</p>
<h3>Money, money, money</h3>
<p>The Commission’s plan is to invest up to €10 billion to develop Europe's cloud and data infrastructures.</p>
<p>The EU’s executive arm would invest €2 billion from programs in its long-term budget such as the Digital Europe Programme, Connecting Europe Facility 2 and InvestEU.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will come from both industry and member countries. National governments will be able to fund these projects through the EU’s coronavirus recovery plan, which has earmarked 20 percent toward digital projects.</p>
<p>The joint cloud declaration also issues demands to non-European cloud companies.</p>
<p>Cloud providers must “guarantee European standards in terms of security, data protection, consumer protection, data portability and energy efficiency and contribute to European digital sovereignty.”</p>
<p>The companies must offer “adequate assurance” that the EU will maintain control over its strategic and sensitive data.</p>
<p>“While all cloud providers are welcome in European cloud federation, the resulting cloud capacities should not be subject to laws of foreign jurisdictions,” the declaration read.</p>
<p>One of the first initiatives to come out of Europe’s cloud push is Gaia-X, a much-hyped European effort spearheaded by Germany and France to build up a European platform that sets common standards for cloud technology. Gaia-X has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1449266">limited</a> the voting rights of non-European cloud computing companies, and they cannot become directors of the association.</p>
<p>ETNO, the association representing Europe’s leading telecom operators, applauded the move.</p>
<p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services. We call for EU targets and commitments that reflect the demand side of the cloud investment story,” said Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general.</p>
<p>Tech lobby DigitalEurope was equally supportive, and announced it was applying for membership in Gaia-X.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Previously, we took a <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pytorch-pipeline/">simple video pipeline</a> and made it as fast as we could without sacrificing the flexibility of the Python runtime. It’s amazing how far you can go — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">9 FPS to 650 FPS</a> — but we did not reach full hardware utilization and the pipeline did not scale linearly beyond a single GPU. There is evidence (measured using <a href="https://github.com/chrisjbillington/gil_load">gil_load</a>) that we were throttled by a fundamental Python limitation with multiple threads fighting over the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a> (GIL).</p>
<p>In this article we’ll take performance of the same <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">SSD300 model</a> even further, leaving Python behind and moving towards true production deployment technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html"><strong>TorchScript.</strong></a> Instead of running directly in the Pytorch runtime, we’ll export our model using TorchScript tracing into a form that can be executed portably using the <code>libtorch</code> C++ runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt"><strong>TensorRT.</strong></a> This toolset from Nvidia includes a “deep learning inference optimizer” — a compiler for optimizing CUDA-based computational graphs. We’ll use this to squeeze out every drop of inference efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk"><strong>DeepStream.</strong></a> While <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">Gstreamer</a> gives us an extensive library of elements to build media pipelines with, DeepStream expands this library with a set of GPU-accelerated elements specialized for machine learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies fit together like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/deepstream_hybrid.svg" alt="DeepStream Hybrid Architecture"></p>
<p>This article will not be a step-by-step tutorial with code examples, but will show what is possible when these technologies are combined. The associated repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>.</p>
<h3 id="torchscript-vs-tensorrt">
  🔥TorchScript vs TensorRT🔥
  <a href="#torchscript-vs-tensorrt">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Both TorchScript and TensorRT can produce a deployment-ready form of our model, so why do we need both? These great tools may eventually be competitors but in 2020 they are complementary — they each have weaknesses that are compensated for by the other.</p>
<p><strong>TorchScript.</strong> With a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code we can generate a deployment-ready asset from essentially any Pytorch model that will run anywhere libtorch runs. It’s not inherently faster (it is submitting approximately the same sequence of kernels) but the libtorch runtime will perform better under high concurrency. However, without care TorchScript output may have performance and portability surprises (I’ll cover some of these in a later article).</p>
<p><strong>TensorRT.</strong> An unparalleled model compiler for Nvidia hardware, but for Pytorch or <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a>-based models it has incomplete support and suffers from poor portability. There is a plugin system to add arbitrary layers and postprocessing, but this low-level work is out of reach for groups without specialized deployment teams. TensorRT also doesn’t support cross-compilation so models must be optimized directly on the target hardware — not great for embedded platforms or highly diverse compute ecosystems.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a baseline from the previous post in this series — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">Object Detection from 9 FPS to 650 FPS in 6 Steps</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/#stage-2-postprocessing-on-gpu">Postprocessing on GPU</a> stage from my previous post is logically closest to our first DeepStream pipeline. This was a fairly slow, early stage in the Python-based optimization journey but limitations in DeepStream around batching and memory transfer make this the best comparison.</p>
<p>This Python-based pipeline runs at around 80 FPS:</p>








<p>After we get a basic DeepStream pipeline up and running we’ll empirically understand and then remove the limitations we see.</p>

<p>Our approach to using TorchScript and TensorRT together in a DeepStream pipeline will be to construct a hybrid model with two sequential components — a TensorRT frontend passing results to a TorchScript backend which completes the calculation.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">
  Hybrid DeepStream Pipeline
  <a href="#hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our hybrid pipeline will eventually use the <code>nvinfer</code> element of DeepStream to serve a TensorRT-compiled form of the SSD300 model directly in the media pipeline. Since TensorRT cannot compile the entire model (due to unsupported <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> ops) we’ll run the remaining operations as a TorchScript module (via <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/plugin-manual/index.html#page/DeepStream%20Plugins%20Development%20Guide/deepstream_plugin_details.html#wwpID0E0TDB0HA">the <code>parse-bbox-func-name</code> hook</a>).</p>
<p>However, the first pipeline will be the simplest possible while still following the hybrid pattern. The TensorRT model does no processing and simply passes frames to the TorchScript model, which does all preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing. 0% TensorRT, 100% TorchScript.</p>
<p>This pipeline runs at 110 FPS without tracing overhead. However, this TorchScript model has already been converted to <code>fp16</code> precision so a direct comparison to the Python-based pipeline is a bit misleading.</p>








<p>Let’s drill into the trace with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems">Nvidia’s Nsight Systems</a> to understand the patterns of execution. I have zoomed in to the processing for two 16-frame batches:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch_hu85cb8d526cf1fda403db89df3e60bf80_432723_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Looking at the red NVTX ranges on the <code>GstNvInfer</code> line we can see overlapping ranges where batches of 16 frames are being processed. However, the pattern of processing on the GPU is quite clear from the 16 utilisation spikes — it is processing frame-by-frame.  We also see constant memory transfers between device and host.</p>
<p>Drilling in to see just two frames of processing, the pattern is even more clear:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_421239_896x540_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="540">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>With a little knowledge of how DeepStream works the problem is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> sends batches of frames to the configured model engine (our empty TensorRT component) — great.</li>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> then sends the model output <em>frame by frame</em> to the postprocessing hook (our TorchScript component).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we have put our entire model into a TorchScript postprocessing hook we are now processing frame by frame with no batching, and this is causing very low GPU utilisation. (This is why we are comparing against a Python pipeline with no batching).</p>
<p><strong>We are using DeepStream contrary to the design</strong>, but to build a truly hybrid TensorRT and TorchScript pipeline we need batched postprocessing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing Hooks are Frame-by-Frame</strong></p>
<p>The design of <code>nvinfer</code> assumes model output will be postprocessed frame-by-frame. This makes writing postprocessing code a tiny bit easier but is inefficient by default. Preprocessing, inference and postprocessing logic should always assume a batch dimension is present.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Nsight Systems view above also shows a pointless sequence of device-to-host then host-to-device transfers. The purple device-to-host memory transfer is due to <code>nvinfer</code> sending tensors to system memory, ready for the postprocessing code to use it. The green host-to-device transfers are me putting this memory back on the GPU where it belongs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing is Assumed to Happen on Host</strong></p>
<p>This is a legacy of early machine learning approaches. Modern deep learning pipelines keep data on the GPU end-to-end, including data augmentation and postprocessing. See Nvidia’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/DALI">DALI library</a> for an example of this.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, time to hack DeepStream and remove these limitations.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Nvidia have provided source for the <code>nvinfer</code> pipeline element. I’ve made two changes to better support our approach of doing significant work in the postprocessing hook and fix the above limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> model engine output is now sent in a single batch to the postprocessing hook.</li>
<li>Model output tensors are no-longer copied to host, but are left on the device.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  These <code>nvinfer</code> changes are unreleased and are not present in the companion repository (<a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>) because they are clearly derivative of <code>nvinfer</code> and I’m unsure of the licensing. Nvidia people, feel free to get in touch: <a href="mailto:paul@paulbridger.com">paul@paulbridger.com</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>With hacked DeepStream and no model changes at all this pipeline now hits 350 FPS when measured with no tracing overhead. This is up from 110 FPS with regular DeepStream. I think we deserve a chart:</p>








<p>The <code>Concurrency 1x2080Ti</code> stage from the Python pipeline is now the closest comparison both in terms of FPS and optimizations applied. Both pipelines have batched inference, video frames decoded and processed on GPU end-to-end, and concurrency at the batch level (note the overlapping NVTX ranges below). One additional level of concurrency in the Python pipeline is multiple overlapping CUDA streams.</p>
<p>The Nsight Systems view shows processing for several 16-frame batches:</p>

</a>

<p>We now have good GPU utilization and very few needless memory transfers, so the path forward is to optimize the TorchScript model. Until now the TensorRT component has been entirely pass-through and everything from preprocessing, inference and postprocessing has been in TorchScript.</p>
<p>It’s time to start using the TensorRT optimizer, so get ready for some excitement.</p>

<p>According to Nvidia, TensorRT <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">“dramatically accelerates deep learning inference performance”</a> so why not compile 100% of our model with TensorRT?</p>
<p>The Pytorch export to TensorRT consists of a couple of steps, and both provide an opportunity for incomplete support:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export the Pytorch model to the <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> interchange representation via <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html#tracing-vs-scripting">tracing or scripting</a>.</li>
<li>Compile the ONNX representation into a TensorRT engine, the optimized form of the model.</li>

<p>If you try to create an optimized TensorRT engine for this entire model (SSD300 including postprocessing), the first problem you will run into is the export to ONNX of the …</p></article></div>

              <p>When I was a high school student in New Jersey, the state legalized gambling in Atlantic City. As a math and games enthusiast, I was immediately drawn to the Blackjack tables and the prospect of gaining an edge over the house by counting cards.</p>
<p>I was never very good at it but I do hold the distinction of being ejected from a casino, not because I was particularly successsful, but because I was amateurishly consulting a poorly concealed cheat sheet.</p>

<p>Yes, there you were, maybe 30 years ago, standing at the end of a road before 
a small brick building.</p>
<p>After enduring miles of twisty little passages through the years, all alike 
yet all different, you find yourself again searching with lantern in hand for 
the way back to the cave. And you remember:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>ducking axes and knives thrown by threatening little dwarves<br>
	the agony of the first time a pirate stole your hard earned treasure<br>
	the panic at finding you had lost everything when you were reincarnated<br>
	the exhilaration from solving the Plover Problem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You missed appointments, dreamt the strangest dreams and drew maps... lots of 
them... revised over and over...</p>
<p><img src="http://www.spitenet.com/cave/images/MapsText.jpg" width="158" height="65" alt="MAP"></p>
<p>If you have Master Adventurer status and you've found the repository, then I hope you 
will find my map nostalgic.</p>
<p>If you haven't, then please don't look. You may be frustrated at the moment 
by the shadowy figure waving back at you from across the pit or you may be at 
Witt's End, but stick with it <i>without</i> looking at the map.</p>
<p>My map is based on my perception of the Colossal Cave Adventure 350 point 
version game, originally written by Will Crowther (1975) and revised by Will Crowther 
and Don Woods (1976). I've included a web-viewable .jpg, mobile phone sized .jpg, and a PDF print 
version. Since the PDF version is for printing on 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper, the file 
size is large (1.3 MB). Please download the file if you want to print out the map. 
I've set the link for it to go straight to the download pop-up to save on 
bandwidth. The .jpg version is large enough to clearly view in your browser, but 
the print quality would be poor.</p>
<p>There are two version of the map below:</p>

<ul><li>COMPLETE Spoiler Version: This version has it all - the room names, where the treasures are found and the compass points.</li>
<li>NO CLUES Version: You can navigate through the cave with this map, but the rooms are unnamed and the treasures are not marked. Might be fun if you've played the game for awhile and keep getting lost. You can fill in the room names and compass directions yourself as you go.</li>
</ul>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

That's it! The network is ready to learn.

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

			<p>This is a technical write up of the author’s investigation on how users of Samsung phones in Hong Kong (and Macau), using firmware released in September 2020, would be forced to use a public DNS service in Mainland China, which caused unease and privacy concerns among some of its users.</p>
<p>While this was investigated on a variant of a Galaxy Note 10+ phone targetting the Hong Kong market, it was reported that the issue exists for a wide range of recent Samsung phones, including those sold in other places when used in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Update: The firmware update released in Mid-October 2020 has fixed the DNS issue discussed in this Part, but the issue of DNS queries for <code>qq.com</code> discussed in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/15/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users-2/">Part 2</a> remained unchanged.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Shameless plug (for Hong Kong users): The author is the developer of Headuck Call blocker (useful only in Hong Kong). Earlier it got mistakenly flagged as malware by Google and lost many of its users, but the appeal was successful and the App is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headuck.headuckblocker.dev">on Google Play</a> again. Please re-consider the App if you got scared by the earlier Google Play malware warning.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In early October 2020, a Samsung phone user in Hong Kong, local forum (HKEPC) user dingwinslow209, <a href="https://www.hkepc.com/forum/viewthread.php?fid=168&amp;tid=2586830">reported that (link to forum post in Chinese)</a> an extra DNS server entry, <code>114.114.114.114</code> was added to the DNS setting of his Samsung mobile phone, which was updated with the latest firmware, whenever he was using a WiFi connection.&nbsp; This happened both when the DNS setting is static, or dynamic using DHCP (but not when VPN / mobile network was used).&nbsp; Even when both DNS1 and DNS2 were set to valid DNS servers (e.g. Google public DNS service using <code>DNS1 = 8.8.8.8</code> and <code>DNS2 = 8.8.4.4</code>), a new DNS3 entry pointing to <code>114.114.114.114</code> would appear in some utility app.</p>
<p>This immediately raised privacy concerns among some Samsung users in Hong Kong, as the public DNS server <code>114.114.114.114</code> is owned by Cogent Communications, under <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/114.114.114.114">Nanjing XinFeng Information Technologies Inc</a>, in Mainland China.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in another local forum (lihkg), users captured DNS requests to <code>114.114.114.114</code>, and observed queries for “<code>qq.com</code>”&nbsp; (domain owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent), even when no software from Tencent is installed in the devices.&nbsp; There were reports that these DNS queries were sent once per minute, so long as the phone screen remained on.</p>
<p>There are further reports that when DNS queries to qq.com were blocked, the phone would report no internet connectivity via the WiFi connection.</p>
<p>The observation of the extra DNS entry was later independently confirmed by other forum users and the local media, using recent Samsung phones which have been updated in recent months.&nbsp; (See the links in the HKPEC post above, in Chinese).&nbsp; The issue persisted even when users reset their Samsung phone to factory settings. This showed that the issue originates from Samsung firmware instead of some third-party software malware.</p>
<p>The following documents the technical investigation and verification of the issue directly from analysing the code from firmware.&nbsp; The information should be sufficient for the issue and its extent to be independently verified.</p>
<h3>Getting and extracting the firmware</h3>
<p>To confirm the issue, a recent Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ firmware (SM-N9750 TGY, Hong Kong version), at Security Patch level 2020-09-01 was downloaded from one of the Samsung firmware download sites. Galaxy Note 10+ is one of the Samsung models reportedly&nbsp;affected.</p>
<p>After unzipping the downloaded firmware (in zip format), expanding the tar file beginning with “<code>AP_N9750ZSU3CTH1</code>“, decompressing the file <code>system.img.ext4.lz4</code> using <code>lz4</code>, converting it to ext4 format using <code>simg2img</code>, and mounting it as ext4 volume under Linux, one has access to the system image which would be installed when Note 10+ users update their phone to that patch level. (The same is accessible if a Note 10+ phone is rooted).</p>
<p>After some research, the culprit was found – a vendor specific service level component, added by Samsung to the Android framework, located at <code>/system/framework/wifi-service.jar</code>. This seems to work at the android system service level, supplementing the usual <code>services.jar</code>.</p>
<p>The decompiled source of the jar file (using <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk">this site</a>, with Jadx decompiler) has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY">https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY</a>.&nbsp; The following is a walkthrough of the relevant code when a user connects to a WiFi network, showing how the DNS entries were modified.</p>
<h3>Relevant flow of DNS entry addition</h3>
<p>The main culprit is the class <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, located in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>. The decompiled code contains the following:</p>
<p>line 129: the hardcoded address <code>114.114.114.114</code></p>
<pre>private static final String CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP = "114.114.114.114";</pre>
<p>line 878: addresses used for DNS probe (to be covered in next part).</p>
<pre>public final String DEFAULT_URL = "http://www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_CHINA = "http://www.qq.com";
public String DEFAULT_URL_STRING = "www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_STRING_CHINA = "www.qq.com";</pre>
<p>This large class is mainly a state machine of the various WiFi states. The state hierarchy are defined, and initial state set, at lines 1185-1197.</p>
<pre>addState(this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mNotConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mCaptivePortalState, this.mConnectedState);
addState(this.mEvaluatedState, this.mConnectedState);
....
setInitialState(this.mNotConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The base class for the StateMachine can be found under AOSP source (<a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/java/com/android/internal/util/StateMachine.java?q=StateMachine.java&amp;ss=android%2Fplatform%2Fsuperproject">StateMachine.java</a>).</p>
<p>When the device is connected to WiFi, it would enter <code>ConnectedState</code>.</p>
<p>line 1976 (under <code>processMessage()</code> of the initial <code>NotConnectedState</code>) would be invoked when a new WiFi connection is detected.</p>
<pre>wifiConnectivityMonitor.transitionTo(wifiConnectivityMonitor.mConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The <code>mConnectedState</code> variable is of class <code>ConnectedState</code>, defined from line 1988. The <code>enter()</code> method of <code>ConnectedState</code> contains the following code (from line 2090), which uses <code>CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP</code> (i.e. the Mainland Chinese controlled DNS server):</p>
<pre>if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager != null &amp;&amp; WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
    Message msg = new Message();
    msg.what = 330;
    Bundle args = new Bundle();
    args.putString("publicDnsServer", WifiConnectivityMonitor.CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP);
    msg.obj = args;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager.callSECApi(msg);
}
</pre>
<p>From the code it seems to add the Mainland Chinese DNS service to the user’s list of DNS server automatically, when the device is connected to Chinese mobile network. There seems no option to disable the behaviour.</p>
<p><code>WifiConnectivityMonitor.inChinaNetwork()</code> is at line 11199.&nbsp; As suggested by its name, it should obtain the ISO code and return true only if the device is connected to a mobile network in China:</p>
<pre>public boolean inChinaNetwork() {
    String str = this.mCountryIso;
    if (str == null || str.length() != 2) {
        updateCountryIsoCode();
    }
    if (!isChineseIso(this.mCountryIso)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!DBG) {
        return true;
    }
    Log.d(TAG, "Need to skip captive portal check. CISO: " + this.mCountryIso);
    return true;
}
</pre>
<p>Digging deeper, this is how the ISO code (<code>mCountryIso</code>) is obtained, under <code>updateCountryIsoCode()</code> at line 11219 (fallback skipped).</p>
<pre>public void updateCountryIsoCode() {
    if (this.mTelephonyManager == null) {
        try {
            this.mTelephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) this.mContext.getSystemService("phone");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Exception occured at updateCountryIsoCode(), while retrieving Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE");
        }
    }
    TelephonyManager telephonyManager = this.mTelephonyManager;
    if (telephonyManager != null) {
        this.mCountryIso = telephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso();
        Log.i(TAG, "updateCountryIsoCode() via TelephonyManager : mCountryIso: " + this.mCountryIso);
    }
    /* fallback when there is no mobile network skipped. The fallback is to read the CountryISO setting from a Samsung config file (cscfeature.xml) */
    ....
}
</pre>
<p>(While not shown here, this code is also invoked when initializing and when change in ISO code of telephone network is detected, so it need not be called during each check.) The country code is get from <code>TelephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso()</code> which is a standard Android API, documented <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#getNetworkCountryIso()">here</a>. It returns the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code equivalent of the MCC (Mobile Country Code) of the mobile operator. In Hong Kong, this is “HK”, and in Mainland China this is “CN”.</p>
<p>As one might suspect at this point, the problem lies in <code>isChineseIso()</code>, at line 11214:</p>
<pre>private boolean isChineseIso(String countryIso) {
    return "cn".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "hk".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "mo".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso);
}</pre>
<p>This means that you are treated as being connected to a Chinese mobile network if you are connected to a Hong Kong mobile network for the purpose of adding the 114 DNS service.&nbsp; (BTW, “MO” is the ISO-3166-1 code for Macau.) Perhaps Samsung might want to address cases when people travel to Mainland China while forgetting to reset their hardcoded DNS settings, and kindly “add” a DNS service which works within the Great Firewall of China. But they seemed to forget that both Hong Kong and Macau are outside the Great Firewall, at least so far.</p>
<p>Back to the DNS setting code above (line 2090). It makes a binder call to <code>WifiManager.callSECApi()</code>, with message code = 330, with a <code>Bundle</code> setting <code>publicDnsServer</code> to our friend <code>114.114.114.114</code>. While <code>WifiManager</code> is a standard Android class the method <code>callSECApi()</code>, as suggested by its name, is Samsung specific.</p>
<p>The remote call to <code>WifiManager</code> would end up in the service class implementation at <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiServiceImpl</code>, implementing WifiService, at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiServiceImpl.java">WifiServiceImpl.java</a>. (The class is Samsung’s extension to the AOSP service class of the same …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

October 18, 2020 | https://www.swyx.io/svelte-sites-react-apps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.swyx.io/svelte-sites-react-apps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 2020, my personal recommendation to web developers is to use <strong>Svelte for Sites, and React for Apps</strong>. This is, remarkably, a nuanced enough opinion that it pisses off fans of <em>either</em> of them.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in my <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/432/">Shoptalk Show interview</a> and Chris Coyier encouraged me to blog about it. Let me try to explain.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="sites-vs-apps"><a href="#sites-vs-apps">Sites vs Apps</a></h2>
  <p>First, I have to make a distinction between (Web) Sites and (Web) Apps. There are serious, intelligent people who insist that there isn't one. They want to build everything on the web with the same tech. Respectfully, <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html">they are wrong</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Sites</strong> primarily display content, while interaction is limited. First-load times are paramount since users may bounce and/or their limited data/power/CPU may deprive them of important information (see <a href="https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/">Alex Russell for math on a reasonable baseline</a>). This was the web's original usecase - displaying information - and it is what HTML/CSS/Browsers are great at.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Apps</strong> primarily exist for interaction. CRUD apps, livestream apps, games, whatever. These apps tend to be heavier, which is unfortunate because that affects their performance. But even a 2MB JS app doesn't sound so bad when it is literally competing with a 200MB mobile app, and (let's say) you're developing a B2B app where everyone is on high power and high bandwidth devices anyway. You're typically also keeping apps open longer, so the first-load issue doesn't matter as much (and can be mitigated with service workers). The challenge is even higher once you account for the fact that the Web App must ship with it all the UI components and behaviors for it to work, whereas a typical native app will usually heavily lean on platform-provided components. The web platform still lacks a lot of standard components/APIs and developer experience needed to make writing great Web Apps easy - hence the gap is filled by frameworks.</p>
  <p>I view Sites vs Apps as a spectrum. Of course, if your sites dont need ANY interaction at all, don't use any JS. But most sites have app-like features (login, reactions, comments), and many apps need to perform under site-like constraints.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="react-for-apps"><a href="#react-for-apps">React for Apps</a></h2>
  <p>React has been open sourced for 7 years now. It is used in production at the biggest companies and sites in the world from Apple to Twitter to Amazon to Airbnb to Uber. It has been the most cited technology in Hacker News job postings for <a href="https://www.hntrends.com/2020/may-big-drop-developer-job-postings.html">at least 36 straight months</a>. There are <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1190088019707154432?s=20">between 3-9m React developers</a>, growing <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1024974678337703937?s=20">at least &gt;50% annually</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/Qox56z4xH6o">third party ecosystem is vast</a> and attracting instructors, developers, companies and hundreds of millions in corporate and venture funding.</p>
  <p>Based on that <em>alone</em> it is a good tech choice to base your app on already. But these are contingent facts that don't really have anything fundamental to do with React's merits. This is offensive to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/first-principles-approach/">first principles thinkers</a>. So let me offer some <em>core</em> reasons why React is a great choice for apps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>React Native looked troubled in 2018, but <a href="https://www.reactiflux.com/transcripts/react-native-team-2">the current team</a> seems to be executing well (as far as an outsider like me can tell). <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1301103950066671616?s=20">Flutter may yet give it a run for its money</a> someday, but has the Dart and Google hurdles to overcome. <strong>React Native is the best cross platform (mobile+web+desktop) "Write mostly once, run mostly anywhere" solution</strong> in tech today. If you have the resources to hire platform specialists, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a">you won't find this useful</a>. However, if, like the vast majority of companies, you can't afford a dedicated team of specialists per platform, React Native is your best bet.</li>
    <li>React has by far the most experience in abstraction design. <strong>Where React leads, other frameworks follow</strong> (Both Vue's <a href="https://composition-api.vuejs.org/">Composition API</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao">Svelte 3's $: API</a> directly credit React for inspiration, as do Swift UI and Jetpack Compose). This isn't to say they always get it right (<em>pop quiz: how many Context APIs are there in React?</em>) but when <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html">Concurrent Mode</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn/status/1308438105616191496?s=20">React Flight</a> are released, I expect it to be deeply informed by production usage at the biggest websites in the world. Suspense for Data Fetching, still not yet released, has <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/web/facebook-redesign/">been in production at Facebook</a> for over a year. I want to stress how unusual this is - typically in open source, you release something and then hope it gets picked up by a BigCo and tested at scale. With React, Facebook <strong>dogfoods it at scale</strong> before releasing to the general developer community, with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15257">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prepack/wiki/react-compiler">ideas</a> <a href="https://cdb.reacttraining.com/react-call-return-what-and-why-7e7761f81843">killed</a> before they are publicly blessed, because flaws were found. Judge React as much on what it doesn't ship as you do on what it does ship.</li>
    <li>That brings me to governance. It's not perfect (many people have issues with Facebook, for one thing), but I think <strong>React is one of the best run open source projects in the world</strong>. Normally mundane things like <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-versioning.html">versioning policy</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/">error messages</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/10/22/react-release-channels.html">release channels</a> matter at the scale of React. The team also does a lot of informal collaboration with key ecosystem partners like Gatsby, Apollo and Next.js, including at the browser level with Chrome and the language level with TC39. The team not only deeply cares about technical governance, but also fostering an inclusive and diverse community.</li>
    <li>I hesitated to mention this last point because it technically has to do with adoption, but I cannot separate it from React's merits: it seems to have <strong>the best thinkers on accessibility and interaction design</strong> right now. No other ecosystem has projects like Adobe and Devon Govett's <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html">React Aria</a> that has extensively thought through and tested for WAI-ARIA so you don't have to. Ditto <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/accessible-front-end-application-chakra-ui-nuxtjs/">Segun Adebayo's Chakra UI</a>. Or listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhKglxQT4sU">Rick Hanlon on the Touchable Web</a> and realize how much web apps need to improve for the open web to reverse <a href="https://vimeo.com/364402896">its alarming decline vs. mobile walled gardens</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>Let me be clear - is the React community ACTUALLY good at these things today? Hell to the no. Most of them are still debating whether or not to learn hooks vs class components. BUT React has the best shot because it has the best abstractions that enable the best thinkers to create the web application standard library we all want.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17004">Selective</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1200111677833973760?s=20">Progressive Hydration</a> are particularly interesting results of the Fiber rewrite. Together with a "full stack" future of React that lets the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1259615888438935556?s=20">easily move code and execution between client and server</a>, the hope for making apps that feel fast without compromising on developer or user experience is extremely strong.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can, of course, use React to make sites. Gatsby and Next.js (and the upcoming <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>) are great static and serverless rendering options (The "greatness" of Gatsby <a href="https://dev.to/richharris/in-defense-of-the-modern-web-2nia">is disputed</a>). <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> is great for docs sites. If you are making sites and are worried about JS weight, you can usually <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1316540904761520129?s=20">swap Preact for React in a few lines of code</a> because you will usually not be running into any of <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v8/differences-to-react/">Preact's compromises</a> if you are just making a site.</p>
  <p>So why do I advocate using a different framework for sites?</p>

  <h2 id="svelte-for-sites"><a href="#svelte-for-sites">Svelte for Sites</a></h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Specifically, Svelte for <em>Interactive</em> Sites</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Svelte is <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1260209026563858432?s=20">used in production</a>
    from the NY Times (of course) to Square Enix to Apple to Spotify to Google Arts to Alaska Airlines and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/community/tree/master/who's-using-svelte">hundreds more</a>, with other big dev platforms like Amazon and Microsoft also increasingly featuring it in their content. It has a lively community with the first podcasts, YouTube channels, schools, conferences and newsletters emerging. Svelte 3 has been wildly successful and yet it is still early days.
  </p>
  <p>I'm going to let you in on a little secret: <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1255936971265826816?s=20">Svelte and React aren't that different</a>. Take a look <a href="https://lihautan.com/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-1/#compile-svelte-in-your-head">under the hood of Svelte compiled output</a>:</p>
  <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>create_fragment</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>// redacted</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>SvelteComponent</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>super</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>this,</span><span> </span><span>options</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>null,</span><span> </span><span>create_fragment</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>safe_not_equal</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>Wtf? <code>class App extends SvelteComponent</code>?? That looks like React??</p>
  <p>Yes. Wait til you realize that <a href="https://lihautan.com/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-1/#updating-data"><code>=</code> basically compiles to <code>setState</code></a>, or that yes, it does actually <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/tree/master/src/runtime">ship a runtime</a>, or that yes, it actually has <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/ec0f79c5af3113bedf0a5e9ae1f5f521328fcd30/src/runtime/internal/scheduler.ts">a scheduler</a> too. Like I said, where React leads, other frameworks follow. React proved Components are the right way to go.</p>
  <p>This also means that <a href="https://youtu.be/xgER1OutVvU">most React developers can learn Svelte in <em>hours</em></a> so the switching cost is low.</p>
  <p>The differences are large enough, though, in everything else:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JS Weight</strong>. Your site might get green Lighthouse scores, but hopefully you agree that you ideally only ship JS that you use, for your users' sake. Svelte sites are often single digit kilobytes. React+React DOM is ~120kb uncompressed. You can of course slash this severely if you can switch to Preact. But Svelte offers <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1314255119555338241">the smallest measured runtime footprint</a>. We used to worry about the compiler output overhead exceeding the size of React components (smaller runtime = more boilerplate), but <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1297548737091264518?s=20">recent studies have debunked this concern completely</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>But my consideration of JS weight extends beyond just the framework. Anecdotally, the kind of people that are drawn to Svelte seem to be more performance-minded than those in React (see everything that <a href="https://github.com/lukeed/">lukeed</a> makes). This comes from the top - where React devs often import heavy dependencies as long as they kinda fit the usecase, Rich Harris is the kind of stubborn developer that makes his own version of everything because he just needs it to do a smaller job. But also, Svelte is most people's <em>second</em> framework, so they come to it with more of a performance mindset. Collectively, the dependency choices encouraged by the framework's culture also impact the end result of JS weight.</li>
        <li>I am even encouraged by the emerging JAMstack culture in Svelte, where <a href="https://twitter.com/nickreese">Nick Reese</a> has made an excellent implementation of <a href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">Jason Miller's Islands Architecture</a> with <a href="https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/">Elder.js</a>. (<em>TL;DR - typical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD6KTAGrj3E">Gen-2 SSG's</a> send JS to rehydrate the entire page, even the content that doesn't change, whereas Islands Architecture sites only send JS to hydrate dynamic parts of the page and leave the rest untouched.</em>)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Scoped styles</strong>. Need I say more? The way Rich Harris puts it, goes something like this (poor phrasing is my fault): "In my opinion, a frontend framework …</li></ul></section></div></div>

To create something that’s hard for your customer to live without. For me, my AirPods Pro, my Dyson vacuum, Audible, and Spotify are the first to come to mind.</p><p>You don’t want to be one of many. Having to resort to bribing people to use you instead of another company. Sure, you can make money but your company will be very sensitive.</p><p><em>A tiny ‘’push’’ by a competitor or a changing market will displace you out of equilibrium.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Think of delicately balancing a marble on a flipped bowl. If you can balance it, the tiniest force will displace it out of its meta-stable equilibrium.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a startup that’s susceptible to being cloned (Groupon) and succumbing to consumer surplus (Lime, Bird, Spin, etc.) it’ll be more fragile. The ultimate example is dropshipping or any other get rich quick/commodity scheme.&nbsp;</p><p><em>This incidentally, is also why those things don’t work. As soon as you have a formula, the more people will implement it, the less effective it’ll be.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Read: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/antinetworkeffects" target="_blank"><em>Network Effects, Neutral Network Effects, and Anti-Network Effects</em></a></p><p><em>The very existence of an easy formula makes that particular business model meta-stable.</em></p><p><em>Check </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/ten" target="_blank"><em>Ten</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove" target="_blank"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602502923408_28311"><div><p><em>I took these pictures for y’all when I was in Germany for business. As you can see, there’s Lime, Bird, Spin, Tier, and Dott. All fighting for market share and competing away profits. This creates a consumer surplus environment where the consumer would be willing to pay more but they don’t have to. That’s good for the consumer but dangerous for you as a startup.</em></p><p>If you can find a way to create a product that 1 person finds hard to live without, you can probably find 10. If you can find 10, you can probably find 100. And so on.</p><p>As a matter of fact, that 1 person most likely has 1 or 2 friends who they’ll bring into your tribe without you having to do any work. Having a product that people love so much it’s hard to live without makes your company more resilient.</p><p>Getting 1 person to feel that way is both harder and easier than people think. It’s hard because it’ll take a lot of effort and iteration before people truly feel like they would rather not live without your product.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easier because virtually none of your competitors are even trying. They’re too focussed on the bottom line to even think about it. If they do, it’s mostly lip service or an afterthought.</p><p><em>It’s very difficult to push the business out of its equilibrium.&nbsp;</em></p><p>A business is in stable equilibrium if when it’s displaced it experiences a force pulling it back toward its equilibrium. Craigslist still lives on despite many competitors having improved a subset of it.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602502923408_24853"><div><p>Think of a marble in a bowl. If you displace it, it’ll experience a restoring force that’s trying to get it back into its stable equilibrium position. It actually takes a force to keep that marble away from its equilibrium position. That is until you put so much force on it, that it flies out of the bowl. The equivalence of this would be the iPhone vs. Nokia and Blackberry phones.</p><p>Suppose some law was passed that bans Google’s search engine until 2M people sign a petition on change.org to reinstate it. How long until that’d be done?</p><p>Probably not that long. Google is highly stable.</p><p>Now imagine the same thing with Instagram. A lot of people love Instagram but it’s probably not quite as stable as Google. One can imagine a lot of users moving on to TikTok and all of the other social platforms. It also wouldn’t be too long for someone to create a better IG from scratch without all the feature creep. IG would probably still be back though but it would likely take longer than the Google example.</p><p>Now imagine Facebook. Again, seems less stable than IG.</p><p>Now imagine TV. It might not even get back on its feet at all. If it would, it would take significantly longer than any of the previous examples.</p><p>This is essentially what happened during the pandemic. It exposed businesses that were meta-stable and businesses that thrived under this particular pressure. (Anti-fragile. Things that improve when stress is placed upon them.)</p><p>Zoom was anti-fragile because the pandemic made the product better.</p><p>This is why we often hear the following aphorism: ‘’Hard startups are easier than easy startups.’’ That’s because they’re more stable. It’s harder to disrupt a SpaceX or a Stripe than a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/26/on-demand-food-startup-sprig-is-shutting-down-today/" target="_blank">Sprig</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/7/21000094/unicorn-electric-scooter-shut-down-refund-tile" target="_blank">Unicorn Scooters</a>, or a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer" target="_blank">MoviePass</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2><strong>What is an emergency fund?</strong></h2><p>An emergency fund is money you set aside to cover unexpected financial shocks like:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li>A job loss</li><li>Large, unexpected medical bills</li><li>Major home and car repairs</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><p>An emergency fund is not for planned purchases like buying a new house, car, gadget or university tuition. </p><p>‍</p><p>It is best kept in a <a href="https://www.koody.co/saving/top-savings-accounts#easy-access">high-yield easy access savings account</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Why should I build an emergency fund?</strong></h2><p>In a time of crisis, you are hardly thinking straight. It becomes easy to make poor financial decisions like taking out payday loans, selling your investments or pawning your prized possessions. Think of an emergency fund as a shock absorber that prevents you from making poor financial decisions in a time of crisis. Instead of borrowing more money or selling that investment, you can rely on your emergency fund to keep you going for a few months.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To give you some context, think about the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. Many lost their jobs, and for some people, having an emergency fund prevented them from making poor financial decisions.</p><h2><strong>How much should I have in an emergency fund?</strong></h2><p>At Koody, we recommend having at least three months’ worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. For example, if your monthly outgoings including rent or mortgage payments, utility bills and other expenses add up to £2,000, you should aim to have at least £6,000 set aside in an emergency fund. </p><p>‍</p><p>The actual amount you choose to set aside will depend on your personal circumstance.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>How do I build an emergency fund?</strong></h2><ol role="list"><li>Start with a small goal - your emergency fund shouldn’t be a large, unattainable amount. To begin, you could aim for three months’ worth of living expenses.</li><li>Clearly define what an emergency is to you, so you are not tempted to spend the money on something else. For example, is it a job loss? An unexpected medical bill?</li><li>Set a realistic timeframe - don’t expect to save £6,000 in two months if you only earn £2,000 a month.</li><li>Open a separate account or savings pot - this way, your emergency fund is separate from all other accounts.</li><li>Automate your savings - set up a standing order to move money to your emergency fund account regularly.</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>‍<strong>Here’s an example:</strong></p><p>If your goal is to save £6,000 within the next year, start by asking yourself how much you can afford to set aside each month. If you enjoy playing with numbers, have a quick look at your bank statement to calculate how much spare cash you have leftover every month. This will give you a realistic idea of how much money you can afford to set aside.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>If you feel the spare cash you have leftover each month is too small, try to push yourself a little and increase the amount.</p><p>‍</p><p>You can also add extra money to your emergency fund at any time. This will help you reach your goal faster.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>How long would it take to build an emergency fund?</strong></h2><p>Depending on your personal circumstance, it could take a few months or several years.</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>Assuming your goal is to have £6,000 in an emergency fund, if you save:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>£100 every month, it will take you 60 months or five years</li><li>£200 every month, it will take you 30 months or two and a half years</li><li>£500 every month, it will take you 12 months or one year</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Use the emergency fund calculator below to calculate how long it would take you to build an emergency fund.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Where should I keep my emergency fund?</strong></h2><p>We recommend keeping your emergency fund in a high-yield easy-access savings account or ISA. This way, you have instant access to your money whenever you need it, and you also earn some interest.

A lot.</p><p>A site with incredible copy but terrible design will do far better than one with world-class design but horrible copy.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because copy conveys the message. Copy seduces the reader. Copy makes a hot cup of cocoa for you while lighting some candles and putting on slow jams.</p><p>If you’re in a rush, this 1 tip will blow up your sales: <strong>Simplify your communication</strong>.</p><p>Remember that most users are very, very impatient. So when they land on your site and it takes more than… well, immediately, to figure out what it is you do, they’ll do the worst thing you can possibly imagine... hit the dreaded back button.</p><p><strong>The most important thing any beginner should do is to simply make their message clear</strong>. Forget about being cute and fancy.</p><p>A useful heuristic is the niece test: If your 12-year-old niece landed on your website, could she instantly get what you do?</p><p>Another one is the walk test. Put your site on your laptop and see if you can figure out the value prop while walking past it.</p><p>This is where people usually object because what they do is so much more complicated than what other companies are doing. ‘’Surely, my target audience would understand my jargon right?’’</p><p>Maybe. I’m not discounting that, and it’s worth testing. But usually, founders overestimate the degree of interest that cold traffic has. Remember that your prospects are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank">system 1 type thinking</a>: fast, intuitive, unconscious. In that state, they’re equivalent to a teen with a short attention span.

But the above should be your starting point.</p><p><em>But also remember that if you’re professional and communicate mostly in jargon, you’re gonna blend right in with your competition.

A great ad has 3 conditions:</p><p><strong>1. Get attention</strong></p><p>Nothing happens if people don’t see your ad.</p><p><strong>2. Clearly communicate what you want</strong></p><p>Nothing happens if you have attention but people don’t understand what you want from them or how you can help them.</p><p><strong>3. Persuade the prospect</strong></p><p>Nothing happens if you have their attention, they understand what you want from them or how you can help them, but they aren’t persuaded to take action.</p><p><em>I don’t want to go deep into behavior science right now but the easiest way to get people to take action (to cross the action threshold in the </em><a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/36817028/Behavior-Model-for-Persuasive-Design.pdf?1425238284=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DBehavior_Model_for_Persuasive_Design.pdf&amp;Expires=1602589095&amp;Signature=KPddqP810HPTN~SZLDPWhUoEbIIz7rKXZmSs6MVnhCNnTISRH6k60ORCxlQfh8WphZtdJtu85lxVfbuneBEPDVfDlWS7tD8UNBn3Y5YpqvS5TjiQ3c0h9gcHWG00op6Fl5wmABWosDACoudSqS-9p471kocL7es~kQLdvan5FLVH7boNVWk7rS9QOBNU67k95h7Xl1xg1YasOC43BbLs4qeVzNeuZ-mOR7i32gtScEOWvu97ODs48SYSFSmdpXUFaap~Nln2ICvLEsCYdRbs3RN1toGCRHAsuwl1MBUKq8aZxMEKPBn3YCadIiBfwzWGaWuGKCj1ya1cIdrZVhXUSg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA" target="_blank"><em>FBM</em></a><em>) is to 1. Find the people that already want to get the result you’re offering. (That share the outcome or aspiration you’re talking about, to put it in technical terms.) And 2. Simplify the desired behavior such that the quantity of motivation required is minimal and the ability to execute the desired behavior is high. I.e. Make it easy for them.</em></p><p>Now, this isn’t an essay on advertising but those are solid copy conditions as well. Most businesses fail at all 3. Just observe your own behavior while scrolling through Facebook or going through your inbox. Almost no business even gets your attention. Your brain’s spam filter filters it out.</p><p><strong>1.Realize it’s possible to make much more by rearranging letters</strong> <em>(Or by using Dutch School Marketing in general. And yes, an extensive essay on Dutch School is forthcoming for those who’ve been murdering my inbox.)</em></p><p>‘’Well duh!’’, I hear you think. But most founders don’t believe that’s possible. This is why they say things like: ‘’Marketing doesn’t work for our company. It’s very hit or miss.’’ They believe there’s some miraculous marketing god that either graces you or doesn’t.</p><p>Remember that cheap and tiny changes can have disproportionate effects.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Read more about that in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/trivialsolutions" target="_blank"><em>This Essay Will Save Your Company Money</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>2.Practice the oblique elements of creating copy: Swipe File and Cloning</strong></p><p><strong>Start building a swipe file</strong>. Any time you see compelling copy, steal it. Put it in a shoebox and fill that thing up. Headlines, CTA’s, Pictures, Value props, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>This’ll build your mental swipe file, it’ll train you to start noticing great copy so you’ll find more great copy (cuz you’re looking for it), and it’ll build your physical swipe file for moments when you’re lacking creativity and are staring at a blank screen.</p><p><strong>Start cloning copy </strong>that has done well. This is exactly like mathematics. It’s one thing to be able to follow along with a proof, but it isn’t until you recreate it that suddenly all the gaps in your knowledge become painfully apparent. You don’t want to just understand the copy, you want to understand it in your kidneys and spleen. It should become a part of you.</p><p><strong>3.Use the 3 direct elements of creating copy: Fact aggregation, benefit transformation, and offer crystallization</strong></p><p>Fact aggregation: Start writing down every, single fact about the product. Don’t edit yourself and be ridiculously thorough.</p><p>Benefit transformation: Transform as many of those facts into benefits.</p><p>Offer crystallization: Write down your offer and keep rewriting it until it’s crispy. I.e. Clear, snappy, and compelling.</p><p><strong>4.Use all your raw material to craft your copy.</strong></p><p>You got the building blocks with your facts, benefits, offer, swipe file, and the copy you’ve cloned.</p><p>If you lay that all out, you’ll be able to create the skeleton of your copy. You can then sand off the edges and make it into something neat.</p><p>From there it’s testing, testing, and wait for it… yes, more testing.</p><p>Is this going to make you a world-class copywriter by tomorrow 7 PM?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Is this going to give you 6-pack abs, raise your IQ, and instantly make you sexier?&nbsp;</p><p>Why yes again! You’re 2 for 2.</p><p>Look, it’s not magic. And if the people looking for shortcuts would’ve taken the long path instead, they’d be done by now. <em>(Reminds me of a very non-PC saying: Some fat people will do anything to avoid eating less and exercising more. I think that all of us are or have been that person in some area of our lives.)</em></p><p>But applying what you’ve learned in this essay will make you better than a good 90% of companies out there. Most companies don’t know how to do this. And the vast majority of professionals suck at this. When your job isn’t to be effective but rather to avoid getting fired or making your boss look bad, or to win awards, you’re gonna do the opposite of what you need to do if you want to create great marketing. </p><p><em>This is why Dave Trott and Rory Sutherland are always ranting about the sorry state of advertising and marketing. And you know what… they’re not wrong.</em></p><p>There are, however,  a few people that have dedicated their lives to this and they’re absolute monsters. But that’s the cool thing about business, you don’t have to be amazing at every single thing. You just have to be amazing at a few things and okay at the rest.</p><p>This will make you <strong>more </strong>than okay.</p><p>Good luck out there and go build the future,</p><p>RJ</p><p><em>P.S. If you enjoyed this, I got a 4 part essay series that goes into absolutely ridiculous depth on everything mentioned here. Best part? It’s free.</em></p><p><em>You can find it here </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/salesletter" target="_blank"><em>Alchemy: Turning Words Into Money</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

This is an experiment so it might not work. If you’re not interested, skip to ‘’</em><strong><em>FOCUS ON YOUR CUSTOMERS AND BE AWARE OF THE COMPETITION. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND</em></strong><em>.’’</em></p><p>Some of y’all know about the sport I do called Tricking:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602241281880_23682"><div><p>From 2015 till 2020 I had a period of time where I cut back on training in gymnastic gyms and only tricked on hard floor because I was mostly focussed on lifting weights and fighting.</p><p>This year I wanted to get serious about making a comeback. I had a lot of negative thoughts in my head. My sessions were garbage, especially compared to the stuff I used to throw.&nbsp;</p><p>I started to wonder whether I was just getting too old or something. But that didn’t make sense since there are MMA and boxing athletes that are still fighting, not just at a high level, but at the highest possible level on the planet, in their early 40s.</p><p>On top of that, my hard floor sessions were great. It seemed like my brain just couldn’t get used to the timing on a bouncy floor.</p><p>Eventually, I slowly started getting back into the groove… And then corona hit.</p><p>To top it off I also got a nasty lower back injury by slightly misjudging the timing on a women’s spring floor.</p><p>After the gym opened back up a few months ago, I really felt like I was making negative progress.</p><p>That’s when I decided I should see if I could use some behavior science (more out of exasperation than anything). I started to realize that one of the reasons I had bad sessions was because I was rushing. My foundation just wasn’t on point because I hadn’t taken the time to get used to the timing on a spring floor. I’d just plowed through it, hoping it would take care of itself.</p><p>I was also comparing every current session to my best sessions from the past as well as what other great trickers were doing. All extremely counterproductive.</p><p>Eventually, I managed to turn it around by focussing on behavior science’s  core maxim: ‘’Humans change best when they feel shine.’’</p><p><em>From </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/blaming" target="_blank"><em>‘Whose Fault Is It?’</em></a><em>:</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Shine, as defined by Professor BJ Fogg, is that feeling you got when you studied really hard for that crucial exam and learned that you completely aced it. Since shine is a feeling, you can choose to invoke it for the tiniest of progress steps. Doing so is what forms habits, NOT repetition or 21 days as is common sense.</em></p></blockquote><p>I scaled my behavior (tricks) way back such that I created a highly unfair game. A game rigged in my favor, guaranteeing a win. Finally, my tricking started to improve. After a few sessions where I was gradually making real progress, last week my body just ‘’vomited out’’ all the tricks and combos I’d been working on. From very complex tricks to complicated combos I’d never even attempted, let alone landed, in my life.</p><div><p>This was the first time I really felt like it was within my reach to become better than I had ever been.</p></div><p>I was so wrapped up with competing with other trickers and my past self that I was setting myself up to fail. Talk about being unrealistic. Like what did I expect? Just to walk back into the gym after years of not having trained on a spring floor and immediately crank out stuff I had to train years for. Like, come on! And yet that’s how most of our brains work.</p><p>It wasn’t until I rigged the game in my favor and started winning that gradually, using baby steps, my tricking started trending in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p><em>How can you cheat? How can you rig the game in your favor?</em></p><p>Because I wasn’t focussed on myself and was too focussed on others I was doing way too many tricks (or behaviors essentially) simultaneously.&nbsp;</p><p>The tiny pro of that is that last week, everything just fell out in one god-like session. But I came this close to giving up because of it. In hindsight, it was so stupid. I should’ve just picked one trick that was barely out of reach and train towards that. Instead of 20 different ones, some of which were way too hard at the time.</p><p>Compete with the average of yourself over the last week or two. That way, you’ll gradually improve and feel shine.&nbsp;</p><p>That creates a pulling force allowing the desired behavior to escalate, precisely what we want in behavior design.</p><p>Most founders are looking way, way too much at what their competition is doing. The only reason you shouldn’t completely ignore your competition is that they may have stumbled onto great ideas to improve your customers’ lives that you should implement as well.</p><p>In my tricking story, I was the customer. I should’ve been focussed on me. Instead, I was focussed on my past self and my competition (other trickers).</p><p>That’s setting yourself up to fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Start with reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Where are you right now? Where are the customers right now? How can you, by using baby steps, improve their lives ever so slightly?</p><p>If you consistently keep doing that, those small changes will add up.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s already hard enough to obsess over the customer and turn them into a true fan. Obsessing over the competition just makes that harder because when you’re constantly looking at the competition, guess whom you’re not studying?</p><p>Also, you can’t differentiate by copying which is something we’ve covered extensively in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/differentiation" target="_blank">Mountain Of Carrots — How Companies Must Differentiate In A Cluttered Market</a> and <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/antinetworkeffects" target="_blank">Network Effects, Neutral Network Effects, and Anti-Network Effects</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Optimizing_the_timing_of_brainwork">Optimizing the timing of brainwork</span></h2>
<p>Twice a day, we peak in intellectual performance. We can improve our productivity by understanding the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></p>
<h3><span id="Circadian_graph_and_brainwork">Circadian graph and brainwork</span></h3>
<p>Charting the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a> makes it possible to find the best windows of time for brainwork. The <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> graph below was generated with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> using a log of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a>. In the graph, two yellow bands indicate the optimum time for brainwork. The exact timing may differ for each individual. However, the blocks can be easily determined:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Morning block</b>: soon after waking, after morning coffee, or after breakfast. The best brain slot may last 2-4 hours. If you are sleepy in the morning see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">Natural creativity cycle</a></li>
<li> <b>Evening block</b>: soon after <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a>. The second best brain slot may last 2-4 hours as well. If you do not nap, you may not fully benefit from that block (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Power_nap" title="Power nap">Power nap</a>). If you are sleepy during this slot see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping" title="Best time for napping">Best time for napping</a></li></ol>
<p>The graph explains the reasons for which the two brainwork blocks emerge:

<blockquote><i><b>Figure:</b> <b>Optimizing the timing of brainwork with respect to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></b>. This graph was generated with the help of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> on the basis of 3-year-long daily measurements of a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free-running_sleep" title="Free-running sleep">free-running sleep</a> rhythm. The horizontal axis expresses the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_phase" title="Circadian phase">number of hours from awakening</a> (note that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free-running_sleep" title="Free-running sleep">free-running sleep</a> cycle period may be longer than 24 hours). <span>Light blue dots</span> are actual sleep episode measurements with timing on the horizontal, and the length on the left vertical axis. <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">Homeostatic</a></b> sleepiness can roughly be expressed as the <b>ability to initiate sleep</b>. Percent of the initiated sleep episodes is painted as a thick <span>blue line</span> (right-side calibrations of the vertical axis). Adenosine-related <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic_sleep_propensity" title="Homeostatic sleep propensity">homeostatic sleep propensity</a> increases in proportion to mental effort and can be partially cleared by caffeine, stress, etc. <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">Circadian</a></b> sleepiness can roughly be expressed as <b>the ability to maintain sleep</b>. Average length of the initiated sleep episodes is painted as a thick <span>red line</span> (left-side calibrations of the vertical axis). Mid-day slump in alertness is also circadian, but is biologically different and results in short sleep that does not register as a red peak. <b>Sleep maintenance</b> circadian component correlates (1) negatively with core body temperature, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine">catecholamines</a>, and (2) positively with: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Melatonin" title="Melatonin">melatonin</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/REM_sleep" title="REM sleep">REM sleep</a> propensity. <b>Optimum timing of brainwork</b> requires both (1) low <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> sleepiness, and (2) low <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleepiness. There are two high quality alertness blocks during the day: the first after the awakening, and the second after the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a>. Both blocks are marked as <span>yellow</span> bands below the graph.

<h3><span id="Best_brainwork_time">Best brainwork time</span></h3>
<p>The optimum timing of brainwork requires both high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> alertness and high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> alertness. There are two quality alertness blocks during the day: the first occurs after awakening and the second after the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a> period. Both are marked as <span>yellow blocks</span> in the graph (above). For best learning and best creative results, use these yellow blocks for brainwork. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Caffeine" title="Factors that affect sleep"><span>Caffeine</span></a> can only be used to enhance alertness early in this optimum window. Later use will affect sleep (the half-life of caffeine is about six hours). The optimum timing of exercise may vary depending on your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Exercise" title="Factors that affect sleep">exercise</a> goals and the optimum timing of zeitgebers (e.g. early morning for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> people and evening for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(ASPS)" title="Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS)">ASPS</a> people).

<h3><span id="Balanced_24_hour_cycle">Balanced 24 hour cycle</span></h3>
<p>The <span>slanting green line</span> separates the graph into the areas of phase advanced (right) and phase delays (left). The line is determined by points in the graph where the waking time (horizontal axis) added to the sleep time (left vertical axis) equals to 24.0 hours. The place where the <span>green breakeven line</span> crosses the <span>red sleep length line</span> determines the optimum balanced sleep cycle of 24 hours. In the presented example, 17.35 hours of waking, added to the expected 6.65 hours of sleep time complete a balanced full 24 hours sleep-wake cycle. The greater the angle between the <span>green</span> and <span>red</span> lines, the harder it is to balance sleep and fit it into the 24h cycle of the rotating earth. In the example, adding waking hours does not shorten sleep much enough to make the balance easy. This implies that a religious adherence to a 17.35 day may be necessary to balance the cycle. However, this shortened waking day may increase <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_latency" title="Sleep latency">sleep latency</a> and increase the probability of premature awakening, which can also tip the balance towards the phase delay. The <span>vertical aqua line</span> shows where the expected sleep time added to the waking time equals to 24 hours (crossover with the <span>green line</span> representing a perfect 24-hour day). In <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> or <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(ASPS)" title="Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS)">ASPS</a> that 24h balance may be hard to accomplish. For example, without medical intervention, only a large protective zone in the evening, early nap (or no nap), and intense morning exercise can help balance the day in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a>.

If you use an alarm clock to regulate the timing of your sleep, these measurements and recommendations may not apply! In addition, the timing and amplitude of changes differ vastly between individuals!

<h2><span id="Sleeping_against_your_natural_rhythm">Sleeping against your natural rhythm</span></h2>
<p>If you sleep against your natural rhythm you will often experience tiredness or drowsiness that can be resolved by adjusting the sleeping hours. In healthy individuals, the daytime alertness is primarily determined by:
</p>
<ol><li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_components_of_sleep" title="Two components of sleep">circadian phase and homeostatic sleepiness</a></li>
<li> total sleep time the night before</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#NREM_and_memory" title="Memory optimization in sleep">amount of slow-wave sleep the night before</a></li>
<li> regular adherence to the sleep-wake schedule in preceding days</li>
<li> sleep deficits accumulated in the preceding days (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#REM_rebound_hypothesis" title="How do we fall asleep?">REM deficit</a>, SWA deficit, etc.)</li></ol>
<p>All those factors are closely associated with the sleep phase. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_good_sleep:_free_running_sleep" title="Formula for good sleep: free running sleep">Free running sleep</a> provides the best way to maximize alertness throughout a waking day. Free running sleep is likely to shift the minimum temperature point from the early morning closer towards the middle of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Subjective_night" title="Subjective night">subjective night</a>. You should notice <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">increased sleepiness before going to sleep</a> and no <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_inertia" title="Sleep inertia">sleep inertia</a> upon awakening! If you cannot free-run your sleep, it is very important to understand the relationship between your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleep drives as compiled in the table below. In the course of the day, you should move in sync between the yellow areas of the table, i.e. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#Sleep-wake_flip-flop" title="How do we fall asleep?">from perfect alertness to maximum sleepiness, and then back to perfect alertness</a>.

        <div id="post-body"><p>Loyal readers of my blog will have noticed a theme, I’m interested in the continued move to virtualized network functions, and the need for faster networking options on cloud compute. In this blog, we’ll look at the network performance on the juggernaut of cloud computing, AWS.</p><p>AWS is the leader in the cloud computing world, and many companies now run parts of their services on AWS. The question we’ll try to answer in this article is: how well suited is AWS’ ec2 for high throughput network functions.</p><p><em>I’ve decided to experiment with adding a short demo video to this blog. Below you will find a quick demo and summary of this article. Since these videos are new and a bit of an experiment, let me know if you like it.</em></p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwe0gL8VBvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="100g-networking">100G networking</h3><p>It’s already been two years since AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-amazon-ec2-c5n-instances/" rel="noopener">announced the C5n instances</a>, featuring 100 Gbps networking. I’m not aware of any other cloud provider offering 100G instances, so this is pretty unique. Ever since this was released I wondered exactly what, if any, the constraints were. Can I send/receive 100g line rate (144Mpps)? So, before we dig into the details, let’s just check if we can really get to 100Gbs.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is fun :)  97Gbs <a href="https://t.co/6VdkR2Rlr4">pic.twitter.com/6VdkR2Rlr4</a></p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1266037590492241921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>100gbs testing.. We’re gonna need a bigger boat..</figcaption></figure><p>There you have it, I was able to get to 100Gbs between 2 instances! That’s exciting. But there are a few caveats. We’ll dig into all of them in this article, with the aim to understand exactly what’s possible, what the various limits are, and how to get to 100g.</p><h3 id="understand-the-limits">Understand the limits</h3><p>Network performance on Linux is typically a function of a few parameters. Most notably, the number of TX/RX queues available on the NIC (network card). The number of CPU cores, ideally at least equal to the number of queues. The pps (packets per second) limit per queue. And finally, in virtual environments like AWS and GCP, potential admin limits on the instance.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*JUjZ5NOIWUrey-Xm" alt=""></figure><p>Doing networking in software means that processing a packet (or a batch of them) uses a number of CPU cycles. It’s typically not relevant how many bytes are in a packet. As a result, the best metric to look at is the: pps number (related to our cpu cycle budget). Unfortunately, the pps performance numbers for AWS aren’t published so, we’ll have to measure them in this blog. With that, we should have a much better understanding of the network possibilities on AWS, and hopefully, this saves someone else a lot of time (this took me several days of measuring) ;)</p><h3 id="network-queues-per-instance-type">Network queues per instance type</h3><p>The table below shows the number of NIC queues by ec2 (c5n) Instance type.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*P9_cWmValN63fmRXAWqdqg.png" alt=""></figure><p><em>In the world of ec2, 16 vCPUs on the C5n 4xl instance means 1 Socket, 8 Cores per socket, 2 Threads per core.</em></p><p>On AWS, an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) NIC has as many queues as you have vCPUs. Though it stops at 32 queues, as you can see with the C5n 9l and C5n 18xl instance.</p><p>Like many things in computing, to make things faster, things are parallelized. We see this clearly when looking at CPU capacity, we’re adding more cores, and programs are written in such a way that can leverage the many cores in parallel (multi-threaded programs).</p><p>Scaling Networking performance on our servers is done largely the same. It’s hard to make things significantly faster, but it is easier to add more ‘workers’, especially if the performance is impacted by our CPU capacity. In the world of NICs, these ‘workers’ are queues. Traffic send and received by a host is load-balanced over the available network queues on the NIC. This load balancing is done by hashing (typically the 5 tuples, protocol, source + destination address, and port number). Something you’re likely familiar with from ECMP.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*VsV_F3dbhosQXAi9A97mqQ.jpeg" alt=""></figure><blockquote>So queues on a NIC are like lanes on a highway, the more lanes, the more cars can travel the highway. The more queues, the more packets (flows) can be processed.</blockquote><h3 id="test-one-ena-queue-performance">Test one, ENA queue performance</h3><p>As discussed, the network performance of an instance is a function of the number of available queues and cpu’s. So let’s start with measuring the maximum performance of a single flow (queue) and then scale up and measure the pps performance.</p><p>In this measurement, I used two c5n.18xlarge ec2 instances in the same subnet and the same placement zone. The sender is using <a href="https://toonk.io/building-a-high-performance-linux-based-traffic-generator-with-dpdk/index.html" rel="noopener">DPDK-pktgen</a> (igb_uio). The receiver is a stock ubuntu 20.04 LTS instance, using the ena driver.</p><p>The table below shows the TX and RX performance between the two c5n.18xlarge ec2 instances for one and two flows.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GVmlTopDSacvRFilauWZag.png" alt=""></figure><p>With this, it seems the per queue limit is about 1Mpps. Typically the per queue limit is due to the fact that a single queue (soft IRQ) is served by a single CPU core. Meaning, the per queue performance is limited by how many packets per second a single CPU core can process. So again, what you typically see in virtualized environments is that the number of network queues goes up with the number of cores in the VM. In ec2 this is the same, though it’s maxing out at 32 queues.</p><h3 id="test-two-rx-only-pps-performance">Test two, RX only pps performance</h3><p>Now that we determined that the per queue limit appears to be roughly one million packets per second, it’s natural to presume that this number scales up horizontally with the number of cores and queues. For example, the C5n 18xl comes with 32 nic queues and 72 cores, so in theory, we could naively presume that the (RX/TX) performance (given enough flows) should be 32Mpps. Let’s go ahead and validate that.</p><p>The graph below shows the Transmit (TX) performance as measured on a c5n.18xlarge. In each measurement, I gave the packet generator one more queue and vcpu to work with. Starting with one TX queue and one VCPu, incrementing this by one in each measurement until we reached 32 vCPU and 32 queues (max). The results show that the per TX queue performance varied between 1Mpps to 700Kpps. The maximum total TX performance I was able to get however, was ~8.5Mpps using 12 TX queues. After that, adding more queues and vCPu’s didn’t matter, or actually degraded the performance. So this indicates that the performance scales horizontally (per queue), but does max out at a certain point (varies per instance type), in this case at 8.5 Mpps</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7ATryTmrHyn_Inaj" alt=""><figcaption>c5n.18xlarge per TX queue performance</figcaption></figure><p>In this next measurement, we’ll use two packet generators and one receiver. I’m using two generators, just to make sure the limit we observed earlier isn’t caused by limitations on the packet generator. Each traffic generator is sending many thousands of flows, making sure we leverage all the available queues.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*S8jlTc-v-Krm8BLx1QCGtw.png" alt=""><figcaption>RX pps per C5N instance&nbsp;type</figcaption></figure><p>Alright, after a few minutes of reading (and many, many hours, well really days.. of measurements on my end), we now have a pretty decent idea of the performance numbers. We know how many queues each of the various c5n instance types have.</p><blockquote><strong>We have seen that the per queue limit is roughly 1Mpps. And with the table above, we now see how many packets per second each instance is able to receive (RX)</strong>.</blockquote><h3 id="forwarding-performance">Forwarding performance</h3><p>If we want to use ec2 for virtual network functions, then just receiving traffic isn’t enough. A typical router or firewall should both receive and send traffic at the same time. So let’s take a look at that.</p><p>For this measurement, I used the following setup. Both the traffic generator and receiver were C5n-18xl instances. The Device Under Test (DUT) was a standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instance using the ena driver. Since the earlier observed pps numbers weren’t too high, I determined it’s safe to use the regular Linux kernel to forward packets.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rK_4B6M-0NF2mrrDmheuFQ.png" alt=""><figcaption>test setup</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UUWrmoLH-MXLMsNBdCvJXg.png" alt=""><figcaption>pps forwarding performance</figcaption></figure><p>The key takeaway from this measurement is that the TX and RX numbers are similar as we’d seen before for the instance types up to (including) the C5n 4xl. For example, earlier we saw the C5n 4xl could receive up to ~3Mpps. This measurement shows that it can do ~3Mpps simultaneously on RX and TX.</p><p>However, if we look at the C5n 9l, we can see it was able to process RX+ TX about 6.2Mpps. Interestingly, earlier we saw it was also able to receive (rx only) ~6Mpps. So it looks like we hit some kind of aggregate limit. We observed a similar limit for the C5n 18xl instance.</p><h3 id="in-summary-">In Summary.</h3><p>In this blog, we looked at the various performance characteristics of networking on ec2. We determined that the <strong>performance of a single queue is roughly 1Mpps</strong>. We then saw how the number of queues goes up with the higher end instances up until <strong>32 queues maximum</strong>.</p><p>We then measure the RX performance of the various instances as well as the forwarding (RX + TX aggregate) performance. Depending on the measurement setup (RX, or TX+RX) we see that <strong>for the largest instance types, the pps performance maxes out at roughly 6.6Mpps to 8.3Mpps</strong>. With that, I think that the C5n 9l hits the sweet spot in terms of cost vs performance.</p><h3 id="so-how-about-that-100g-test">So how about that 100G test?</h3><p>Ah yes! So far, we talked about pps only. How does that translate that to gigabits per second?<br>Let’s look at the quick table below that shows how the pps number translates to Gbs at various packet sizes.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sXL3CJJ9M955aa8DvRUVyw.png" alt=""></figure><p>These are a few examples to get to 10G at various packet sizes. This shows that in order to support line-rate 10G at the smallest packet size, the system will need to be able to do ~14.88 Mpps. The 366 byte packet size is roughly the equivalent average of what you’ll see with an IMIX test, for which the systems needs to be able to process ~3,4Mpps to get to 10G line rate.</p><p>If we look at the same table but then for 100gbps, we see that at the smallest packet size, an instance would need to be able to process is over 148Mpps. But using 9k jumbo frames, you only need 1.39Mpps.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WbChAl1uTuUMnP6oHFzRhg.png" alt=""></figure><p>And so, that’s what you need to do to get to 100G networking in ec2. Use Jumbo frames (supported in ec2, in fact, for the larger instances, this was the default). With that and a few parallel flows you’ll be able to get to 100G “easily”!</p><h3 id="a-few-more-limits">A few more limits</h3><p>One more limitation I <a href="https://cloudonaut.io/ec2-network-performance-cheat-sheet/" rel="noopener">read about while researching</a>, but didn’t look into myself. It appears that some of the instances have time-based limits on the performance. This <a href="https://www.bluematador.com/blog/ec2-packets-per-second-guaranteed-throughput-vs-best-effort" rel="noopener">blog</a> calls it Guaranteed vs. Best Effort.

<p>Lately I’ve gotten <em>especially</em> annoyed at all of the Electron-based junk running on my machine, since I have to work from home, which means needing to use Docker to run or test out various Linux things, which is another 2 gigs of my laptop’s precious memory eaten away. I decided to look for non-Electron alternative clients for all of those. Enter <a href="https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd"><code>spotifyd</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui"><code>spotify-tui</code></a>. After switching software, I have an extra half-gig of memory that isn’t being wasted running yet another instance of Chromium.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll show you how to set up these on your macOS machine. I assume basic familiarity with managing your machine via Terminal. You’ll also need a Spotify Premium account for any of this to work. The wood chipper that is modern society can’t operate without sacrificing a few limbs!</p>
<h2 id="installing-and-configuring-codespotifydcode">Installing and configuring <code>spotifyd</code></h2>
<p>This is an always-on service (hence the <code>d</code> in its name, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemon</a>) that will wait in the background and play music requested by whatever Spotify client we choose; in this case, <code>spotify-tui</code>.</p>
<p>First, get <code>spotifyd</code> installed. I’ve added it to <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> already, so if you need to get that set up first, go ahead.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>You’ll need to create a configuration file named <code>~/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf</code> that specifies your login information and other details. You can <a href="https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#configuration-file">read the full instructions</a>, but I’ve annotated my own configuration here:</p>
<div>

<span>volume_controller</span> <span>=</span> <span>softvol</span>
<span>zeroconf_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>1234</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Create and edit this file with <code>vim</code>, or whatever text editor you prefer:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ~/.config/spotifyd
vim ~/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next you’ll need to add your password to the system password manager. You can do this via the Keychain Access app, or just right in the Terminal:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>security add-generic-password <span>-s</span> spotifyd <span>-D</span> rust-keyring <span>-a</span> &lt;your username&gt; <span>-w</span> &lt;your password&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Be sure to use your <em>Spotify</em> username here, not your macOS username. You can confirm that it was added correctly by opening up Keychain Access and searching for <code>spotifyd</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jonathanchang.org/uploads/2020/spotify/keychain.png" alt="Proper spotifyd credentials in Keychain Access"></p>
<p>This should be all the configuring you need to do. To test if it worked, first run <code>spotifyd</code> as just a plain app. After you run the following command, grant <code>spotifyd</code> access to the macOS Keychain and Firewall in the pop up that appears:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>spotifyd <span>--no-daemon</span>
<span>Loading config from "/Users/jonchang/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf"

Authenticated as "jonchang" !
Country: "US"
</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If everything worked correctly, you should similar output to what I have above. Open the official Spotify client on your phone or laptop, and confirm that there’s a new device in Spotify Connect:</p>
<p><img src="https://jonathanchang.org/uploads/2020/spotify/spotify-connect.png" alt="Spotify Connect with spotifyd visible"></p>
<p>Press <code>CTRL-C</code> to stop <code>spotifyd</code>. Now we’ll use <code>brew services</code> to to run <code>spotifyd</code> in the background:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>brew services start spotifyd
<span>==&gt;</span><span> </span>Successfully started <span>`</span>spotifyd<span>`</span> <span>(</span>label: homebrew.mxcl.spotifyd<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you still see <code>spotifyd</code> show up in Spotify Connect, it worked!</p>
<h2 id="installing-and-configuring-codespotify-tuicode">Installing and configuring <code>spotify-tui</code></h2>
<p>The Terminal app <code>spotify-tui</code> is how you’ll actually control <code>spotifyd</code> by showing you playlists and giving you playback controls and so on. There’s not that much involved, as the app itself will give you instructions that you can follow quite easily.</p>
<p>You’ll have to click through the Spotify Developer agreement and copy and paste some stuff, but it’s nothing too onerous. Just remember to say you’re making a non-commercial app, and set the “Redirect URI” in the Spotify Developer dashboard and everything should be peachy.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>brew <span>install </span>spotify-tui

How to get setup:

  1. Go to the Spotify dashboard - https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications
  2. Click `Create a Client ID` and create an app
  3. Now click `Edit Settings`
  4. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs
  5. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!
</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you’ve set everything up correctly you should see the text interface pop up like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://jonathanchang.org/uploads/2020/spotify/spotify-tui.png" alt="The spotify-tui text-mode interface"></p>
<p>To be honest, I used it for a bit, and then decided that I didn’t really like text-mode interfaces all that much. Instead, I just control Spotify from my phone via Spotify Connect, so this hasn’t gotten that much use. Maybe one day I’ll teach myself Swift and write a native macOS Spotify Connect player…</p>
<h2 id="but-im-on-linux">But I’m on Linux!</h2>
<p>I dunno, on Linux you’re generally expected to figure things out on your own, so maybe try <code>apt install spotifyd spotify-tui</code> followed by <code>sudo systemctl start spotifyd</code> and see if that works <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<h2 id="is-this-all-legal">Is this all legal?</h2>
<p>Probably not. While it <em>would</em> be pretty weird for Spotify to sue or ask to imprison their own paying customers, I can’t predict how Spotify’s CEO might aim to Maximize Shareholder Value in the future.</p>

                Published on <em>October 15th, 2020</em>

                        </p>
          
          
              <p>Every good developer out there, any person out there who surprises you because they work in a dream company, at some point, demonstrated many signs of determination, if not to say they have demonstrated their skills to some scale. I will not cease to say that the person who would like to give you their money or opportunity would always make sure you have the required intellectual caliber or skillset.</p>

<p>People usually wonder how I can usually foresee how a project can be structured after hearing just a little about the idea. Well, it's practice. I have surely done such a thing before or something similar to it.</p>

<p>So, I will keep this simple and straight forward. I don't care about my page bounce rate. I want you to read this as quickly as possible and gain time for your day. Or maybe you can go ahead later to read <a href="https://phpocean.com/tutorials/front-end/here-s-how-i-forced-myself-to-learn-reactjs/64">this</a> or <a href="https://phpocean.com/tutorials/front-end/the-science-of-creating-fixed-components-on-scroll-with-vanilla-javascript/62">that</a>.</p>

<p><strong>There is no professor or doctor out there who merited such a title without undergoing some years of deliberate practice and studies of their field</strong>.</p>

<p>It bothers me a lot when I see new learners wasting so much time looking for easy frameworks and technologies, new trends, source codes to download, and any other things that can make it easy for them to write "some software", sell it, and become a millionaire. Always ask yourself if everyone was into the same thing you are doing, would anyone ever find what you are looking for? Because nobody would have not created anything.</p>

<p>All the people you follow as your models or mentors have suffered too practicing hard to become the mentors you love.</p>

<h2>Consistency creates identity</h2>

<p>When you are set to learn a new skill, it's only deliberate and consistent practice that can help you become an actual artist. Listening to motivational talks 24h/7 and going to conferences would not develop your ability until you sit down and do it on your own. You must go through the process of mistakes and discoveries. Anyone can become an expert on anything they wish. Just study that thing to the extreme. And as you continue to dirty your hand in the craft, you create an identity of an expert in the field that follows you everywhere you go.</p>

<p>Hard work is what sets people different from the crowd. Follow the crowd and you will be a piece of it. Go beyond it, and you will be exceptional.</p>

<p>Since we are in the era of easy gain mindset, let me make things clear for that category of people. I do understand that we are not all born to suffer before we become successful. But, <em>life in its default algorithm requires a minimum effort in everything</em>. In physics, it's called energy. We call it effort, you know?<br>
So, what you might think was easily given to you has been someone else's effort somewhere.</p>

<p>My fellow developers and learners, drop every dream for now, and get to work. Write the code every day, create projects even if you will throw them away after. Create projects even if they will not be lucrative now. Give time to the system, it will come back to you just like a revelation.</p>

            	<p>Published on <strong>2020-09-30</strong> by <a href="https://techleader.pro/a/65-About">John Collins</a>.  Please follow me on Twitter for more:&nbsp;</p>
            </div>

            <p>If I wanted to explain in simple terms the difference between Marketing and Sales, I would use the following trivial example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marketing is getting them to call you.  Sales is you calling them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joking aside, its actually pretty accurate, as Marketing is about raising your company or product profile to the extent that people out there in the market place have heard about you, while Sales is about the direct approach, for example calling up a prospective customer and actively telling them about your company and product.</p>

<p>So which is more important, Marketing or Sales?  Actually they both compliment each other, so you really need both.  Marketing make it easier for Sales to get that all important first meeting, as prospects are more likely to agree to meet with a company that they have heard good things about in the market place.  Once that threshold is crossed, Sales then need to deliver a compelling and relevant demo pitch, <em>and</em> establish trust and confidence in the prospective customer that they become comfortable enough to sign off on a new purchase order.</p>

<p>So where does Engineering fit into this mix?  Well as an Engineering leader, you need to work closely with both Marketing and Sales.  Firstly you need to deliver a compelling product that is interesting to demo to prospects, then you need to work with Marketing on how to position that in the market place, for example by comparing your product strengths and weaknesses with your rivals, and building marketing stories around that.</p>

<p>On the Sales front, Engineering has to operate in a "sales enablement" role, by providing Sales with product training, product demos, and related collateral to enable them to build exciting demo pitches.  Furthermore, you may find yourself actively presenting some of those pitches depending on your presentation skills, especially if Sales need help with demonstrating to technical audiences (as engineers can communicate more easily with other engineers).</p>

<p>You must not forget that your Engineering team cannot succeed without Marketing and Sales bringing in the money to keep the lights on, while you must also remind them that without Engineering, there would be nothing available for them to sell!  It is a symbiotic relationship, that should be built on mutual respect.</p>

		<p>G-CORE is a graph query language for property graph databases.</p>
<p>G-CORE was design by the LDBC Graph Query Language Task Force, consisting of members from industry and academia, intending to bring the best of both worlds to graph practitioners.</p>
<p>The main features of G-CORE are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Property Graph data model which consists of nodes, edges, paths and properties;</li>
<li>Paths as first class citizens: paths can be queried and manipulated (as nodes and edges);</li>
<li>Core operations: graph patterns (JOF), path patterns (RPQs), aggregation, subqueries (Exists+SetOp), graph and path construction;</li>
<li>Composability: operations where the input and the output are graphs;</li>
<li>Balance between query expressivity and evaluation complexity.</li>
</ul>

<section>

	<p>EZBlocker is a simple-to-use ad blocker/muter for Spotify. EZBlocker will attempt to block ads on Spotify from loading. If an ad does load, EZBlocker will mute Spotify until the ad is over.</p>
<p>There are no fancy features, just pure ad blocking. When an ad is blocked, only Spotify is muted, so no other sounds will be affected. EZBlocker aims to be the most stable and reliable ad blocker for Spotify.</p>
<p>There's no setup required - just drag it into any folder and run. To upgrade your EZBlocker, simply replace the executable file.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ericzhang.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EZBlocker_2018-07-22_23-41-36.png" alt="EZBlocker 1.7.1" width="298" height="197"></p>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>Latest: <a href="https://www.ericzhang.me/dl/?file=EZBlocker.php">Download v1.7.6 (April 22, 2020)</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/Xeroday/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/releases">Changelog and Previous Versions</a></p>
<p>EZBlocker requires Windows 8/10 or Windows 7 with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime" rel="nofollow">.NET Framework 4.5+</a>.</p>


<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Why is my Spotify is permanently muted?</strong><br>
There may be issues with EZBlocker muting Spotify on your computer. You can manually modify your Spotify's volume by opening the Volume Mixer.</p>
<p><strong>How do I block banner ads?</strong><br>
Check the "Block Banner Ads" box to enable banner blocking. Enabling and disabling this feature requires you to run EZBlocker with administrator privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Does EZBlocker block video commercials?</strong><br>
EZBlocker will mute videos but not prevent them from playing. If you don't want video ads, make sure you keep your Spotify minimized.</p>
<p><strong>Why does my anti-virus say EZBlocker is a virus?</strong><br>
The latest version of EZBlocker may be picked up by a few anti virus programs. This is most likely due to the way EZBlocker disables Spotify's ads. If you do not feel comfortable downloading the executables directly, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Xeroday/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/">view the source code and compile it yourself</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I donate?</strong><br>
I don't accept donations for EZBlocker. I would rather you spend your money on Spotify Premium. If Spotify Premium isn't offered in your region, I suggest donating to a non-profit such as the <a href="https://donate.torproject.org/pdr">Tor Project</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is EZBlocker open source?</strong><br>
Yes it is, and I encourage all to contribute. The source &amp; technical description is available on <a href="https://github.com/Xeroday/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you run into any issues, comment below in detail the issue you're having.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jpakkane">Jussi Pakkanen</a>, author of the <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a> build system, wrote a nice article recently called <a href="https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/10/does-c-still-deserve-bad-rap-it-has-had.html">Does C++ deserve its bad rap ..?</a> where he defends C++'s reputation as language that is hard to read and unnecessarily complex.</p>

<p>I've not been exposed to much C++ in a professional context.  I learned C++98 at university, and the minor update C++03 was published while I was there, but was turned off by its complexity and abandoned it in favour of writing my projects in C where that was acceptable.</p>

<p>C++11 and onward have famously added ergonomic features that have led to a usability rennaisance;  range iteration, smart pointers, lambdas, auto/type inference, et al.  To show that these have made C++ "good, actually", or at least "not that bad", Jussi implemented a small program:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Find all files with the extension .txt recursively in the subdirectories of the current directory, count the number of times each word appears in them and print the ten most common words and the number of times they are used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jussi's <a href="https://paste.debian.net/1167279/">C++ code</a> is available in full, and in his post he gives a helpful rundown of the highlights.  Up front, I agree that the C++ program Jussi wrote is a lot nicer than the C++ that I cut my teeth on.  But what's it like compared to languages that have been created since 1985?</p>

<p>I decided to write a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jmoiron/206337cdc62b999d07ebcbef5c0fc58b">Go implementation</a> that follows the basic structure of Jussi's, and do a rundown comparing the readability of the two.  Go and C++ are really similar.  Go is statically typed, designed by C programmers, and disrespected by people who don't use it.</p>

<p>Because Go is not <em>exactly</em> like C++, the implementation does a few things differently.  Go's <code>regexp</code> package does not contain an iterating regular expression implementation, so to keep things as <em>behaviourally</em> similar as possible I chose to use <code>bufio.Scanner</code> instead.  Also, because Go has explicit error channels, the Go version checks and reports on error conditions, which adds to its length.</p>

<p>Now, lets compare readability.</p>

<p>First, some general things that come up throughout the code.  The main body of the C++ code is not in the <code>std</code> namespace, meaning that <code>std::X</code> appears throughout.  This is what designers call "busy" or "noisy";  too many unnecessary elements in too little space.  This can be avoided via <code>using std</code>, so this is not a huge deal, but it's worth citing up front.  I don't know enough about the C++ community to know if this is representative, but since additional verbosity is the default, it's worth noting.</p>

<p>Next is the way that C++ object construction looks.  In older versions, this was explcit, but verbose.  C++11 brought with it several short cuts that cut out some repetition, but they overload syntax in confusing ways.  For a simple form of this, take the input file stream (ifstream) declaration for reading from each file:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>std::ifstream current_file(e.path());
</code></pre>

<p>In this statement, <code>std::ifstream</code> is the type, <code>current_file</code> is a variable name, and <code>(e.path())</code> is... an argument list to <code>std::ifstream</code>'s default constructor.  Previously, this would look like:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>std::ifstream current_file = std::ifstream::ifstream(e.path())
</code></pre>

<p>Which is stuttery and very noisy, but it's explicit and consistent.  In another section of code, a different type of initialization is done, where the variable receives the value of the argument.  This is done with alternate punctuation, <code>{}</code>'s:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>std::string word{it-&gt;str()};
</code></pre>

<p>The basic function of this code is easy to understand, but the specific operation isn't because of the implicitness and the many-ways-to-do-it.  Go's value construction is more limited in expressiveness, but much more consistent.  The equivalent lines in the Go program are:</p>

<pre lang="go"><code>// to open a file stream
f, err := os.Open(path)
// to create a new string with the value of another string
word := strings.ToLower(scanner.Text())
</code></pre>

<p>This leads us to another readability tradeoff that is relatively widespread, which is Go's more typical use of type inference.  While there is type inference used in the C++ code as well, with the expression <code>const auto &amp;e</code> for the file walk iterator, it's built into Go via the <code>:=</code> operator (sometimes called the walrus operator in other language communities).  The tradeoff here is that type names are absent in the text, which can make it harder to tell at a glance what types are in use in the program.</p>

<p>Go's design encourages omit-by-default.  This leads to less stutter and less noise, which creates cleaner <em>looking</em> code, even if the semantics are identical.</p>

<p>It's an approach that works well with modern editors that are equipped to provide rich type information and provide other search facilities even when the types are being inferred in the text of the program.  These were not widespread in 1985 when C++ was first designed, and nonexistent in 1972 when its predecessor was created.</p>

<p>Go <em>has</em> explicitly type declaration syntax, <code>var word string = strings.ToLower(...)</code>, just like C++ has <code>auto</code> for inference, but it's rarely used outside of cases where type inference is not allowed by the language.  In the past, people have argued that type inference does indeed hurt readability, eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Bracha">Gilad Bracha</a> argued against adding <code>let</code> style inference to Java <a href="https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4459053">2001</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans benefit from the redundancy of the type declaration in two ways. First, the redundant type serves as valuable documentation - readers do not have to search for the declaration of getMap() to find out what type it returns. Second, the redundancy allows the programmer to declare the intended type, and thereby benefit from a cross check performed by the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this style of objection, auto types came to Java via <code>var</code> in Java 10 in 2018, and I think inference is generally considered a productivity and readability benefit in all languages that have adopted it.</p>

<p>These design tradeoffs (plus mandatory semi-colons) combine to make the C++ code noticeably busier than the Go code.  I think a lot of programmers consider these minor details compared to semantic complexity, but other things being equal, they have an impact on readability.</p>

<p>However, for all these differences, parts of the code do read very similarly, and not just because I tried to write the code in the same way:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>struct WordCount {
    std::string word;
    int count;
};
</code></pre>

<pre lang="go"><code>type WordCount struct {
    word  string
    count int
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the top of the program, the type <code>WordCounts</code> looks pretty identical.  The uses of <code>std::X</code> in the C++ code would simplify if we were in the std namespace, which we could do, so lets drop that even though it contributes to visual noise.  In C++, struct's are <em>implicitly</em> <code>typedef</code>-ed, unlike C, which is a little confusing compared to Go's more consistent type declaration syntax.</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>for(const auto &amp;[word, count]: word_counts) {
    word_array.emplace_back(WordCount{word, count});
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looping through the <code>word_counts</code> map feels similar, though C++ again introduces new syntax.  Go's version uses the <code>append</code> builtin, which, while being much better named than <code>emplace_back</code>, is more awkward to use:</p>

<pre lang="go"><code>for word, count := range wordCounts {
    wordArray = append(wordArray, WordCount{word, count})
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an idiom that melts away with enough Go experience, but <code>wordArray.append()</code> or <code>append(&amp;wordArray, ...)</code> would definitely be easier for the uninitiated to understand.</p>

<p>The sort in C++ is a <em>partial sort</em>, which will likely be faster than the full sort that's being done in Go.  This is nice to have at your disposal, but much wider API surface area makes C++ a much bigger thing to learn.</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>// count_order_desc lambda definition:
auto count_order_desc = [](const WordCount &amp;w1, const WordCount &amp;w2) { return w2.count &lt; w1.count; };
// ...
std::partial_sort(word_array.begin(), word_array.begin() + final_size, word_array.end(), count_order_desc);
</code></pre>

<p>In Go, we're sorting the whole slice, and we're defining our functor inline, but it's much the same.</p>

<pre lang="go"><code>sort.Slice(wordArray, func(i, j int) bool {
  return wordArray[i].count &gt; wordArray[j].count
})
</code></pre>

<p>C++ can't really do much about its inheritance of C's inside-out type declarations, but type reuse in declarations is really nice in parameter lists.  The C++ lambda becomes more concise if we imagine an equivalent feature: <code>[](const WordCount &amp;w1, &amp;w1) { return w2.count &lt; w1.count }</code>.  I suppose it may be personal preference if that's more or less readable.</p>

<p>If we zoom out and look at the files as <em>shapes</em>, a clear picture emerges:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>go</th><th>c++</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  <img src="http://jmoiron.net/i/1alme8d.png">
</td><td>
  <img src="http://jmoiron.net/i/2tn9hn3.png">
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The Go program has much shorter, sparser lines.  This is the result of the aggregate noise omission in the language:  parentheses around loop and if conditions, line endings, type noise. Go's <a href="https://medium.com/@matryer/line-of-sight-in-code-186dd7cdea88">line of sight</a> is much better, but this is a little superficial; the C++ program's deeper nesting is due to the Go program scanning the entire file at once, instead of iterating by line and then by token.  If this were a more complex operation, their left alignment would be more similar.</p>

<p>This wouldn't change the C++ program's longer lines.  A small amount of this is stylistic, eg. using <code>f</code> for the file handle, but a lot of it comes down to excess line noise in the type machinery in C++.</p>

<p>The Go program also works with Unicode text files, and compiles and works across Linux, OSX and Windows.  Fixing the C++ code for this would likely further harm its readability.</p>

<p>While I think that cleanliness is a <em>nice</em> property to have, I think it's overrated when it comes ot readability.  People will gladly write much <em>more</em> code in order to make all of their functions short and simple, forgetting that the readability we're most often interested is an understanding of the program in its context and not of each component in isolation.</p>

<p>Despite having used Go for some time, engaging in this honestly has definitely uncovered some weak spots in code that I've learned to live with, but they're worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The zero you pass when making a slice with reserved capacity in <code>make(T, 0, cap)</code> isn't great.  The way that range's behaviour between map and slice types is different is sensible but a little …</p></div></div>

          <p><strong>Where we are</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/in-defense-of-blockchain-voting">published an article in CoinDesk</a> about using crypto to secure our elections. You can read and discuss more on this forum in <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/can-crypto-save-our-elections/885">part 1</a> and <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/how-to-safeguard-elections-with-crypto/886">part 2</a> that go into some detail about how crypto-powered voting would work, and why it would solve many problems that we face today.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Intercoin started building <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/c/applications/14">applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum platform</a>. While it’s not scalable enough to power <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/crypto-not-scalable-enough-to-be-money-cointelegraph">everyday money</a> or <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/ethereum-scalability-viability">massive elections</a>, perhaps Ethereum 2.0 (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-comprehensive-view-of-ethereum-2-0-serenity-5865ad8b7c62">Serenity</a>) will one day become scalable enough that these smart contracts can see wider adoption, even without having to migrate to the Intercoin back-end platform.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Intercoin is planning to release its own Intercoin App in the app stores, and turn <a href="http://intercoin.org/">intercoin.org</a> into a web-based portal that will let anyone with a <a href="https://metamask.io/">Chrome Extension</a> to deploy the smart contracts we developed, invite friends from their contact list, and manage their community together. We also plan to roll out the Intercoin Crypto Show to teach people more about crypto and smart contracts. In the meantime, if you have questions, feel free to ask them in this forum.</p>
<p><strong>Start of the Art in Crypto Voting</strong></p>
<p>For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before. For decades, chess engines were a mere curiosity, but now a smart phone can beat any grandmaster. The same is now true of voting technology. There have been early experiments in Russia running elections on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/moscows-blockchain-voting-system-cracked-a-month-before-election/">Ethereum</a> as well as proprietary platforms like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/russia-vote-blockchain">Waves</a>. It’s still early, but we will see tremendous growth in the coming years.</p>
<p>What if people could vote securely online? Then they would be able to make decisions collectively about a variety of things. Technology can lower the cost of running a secure election, and make it available to any organization, large or small. But who can vote, and when? How do we know that it will be secure? Below, we explore exactly these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Vote?</strong></p>
<p>The first step in democratic elections is determining who can vote, and ensuring that everyone has an equal amount of say. There needs to be some process in place to make sure people don’t create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack#:~:text=In%20a%20Sybil%20attack%2C%20the,diagnosed%20with%20dissociative%20identity%20disorder.">multiple identities</a> to cheat the system. This is accomplished by voter registration, which itself has controversial issues like purging <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-rights/-use-it-or-lose-it---the-problem-of-purges-from-the-registration0/">inactive voters</a> and <a>disadvantaged voters</a> and other ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States#Disparate_impact">disenfranchising voters</a> from even having their voice heard in the election.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day we will come up with better solutions for voter registration, but – for now – this step will have to be done via some established process that a community has. We have deployed the <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">CommunityContract</a> specifically to give communities the ability to determine who can vote, and who can’t.</p>
<p><strong>When Can They Vote?</strong></p>
<p>In the USA, voting normally takes place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)">Election Day</a>, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Some states allow early voting, so people can cast ballots before Election Day.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I wrote about <a href="http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=212">how polling is better than elections</a>. What I meant is that, expecting the entire population to turn out for an election on a specific day will lead to problems with voter turnout. Having a referendum where only 20% of people vote can cast doubt on the legitimacy of whether the outcome faithfully represents the will of the overall population, or just those who bothered to show up. For example, Puerto Rico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Puerto_Rican_status_referendum#:~:text=A%20referendum%20on%20the%20political,overwhelmingly%20chose%20statehood%20by%2097%25.">voted in 2017 to join the United States</a> by an overwhelming 97%, but that is partly due to a boycott by the opposition, who didn’t show up to vote, resulting in a 22.93% turnout. Opinion polls, on the other hand, show 52% support for joining the United States – a majority to be sure, but nowhere near as overwhelming, and possibly within a margin of error.</p>
<p>Polling vs Elections is less about who can vote, but rather about <em>when</em>. You can have a poll take place over a 5 year period, and in any given window of time, a certain small, random representative sample is able to vote. Any given participant can vote at most once in that rolling window, before it moves on to others. Participants can also fail to cast a vote, which is similar to sitting out an election, but at least timing of the eligibility window would be randomized for everyone, and can be lengthened to several days, removing major impediments to voting. Of course, all these parameters are customizable, and letting 100% of the people vote 100% of the time throughout the poll is just like a regular election.</p>
<p>People without a phone or active notifications would be underrepresented, but presumably, those who opted into elections and polls conducted with digital technology, especially about smart contract issues, would take care to have them turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting Voters</strong></p>
<p>Each block in Ethereum has a hash of all transactions it contains, and it is pretty much impossible to control this hash without controlling a majority of mining power on the network. Moreover, controlling this hash would only allow one to possibly control the outcome of a tiny window in a single given election. A lot of effort resulting in almost no vandalism.</p>
<p>It is possible for smart contracts to use the <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11455/inside-a-smart-contract-is-it-possible-to-get-latest-mined-blocks-number-and-i">hashes from previously mined blocks</a> as a “random” seed (better to call “uncontrolled” seed). Based on this seed, we can select <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">members of the voting community</a> who are eligible to vote in any given block, by calling:</p>
<pre>eligible(address, blockNumber)
</pre>
<p>Blocks can go by pretty fast, and someone eligible to vote in block M could be eligible to vote in blocks M+1, M+2, …, M+N. Actually, rather than base it on block number, we use <em>timestamps</em>. That’s because we can’t rely on how quickly blocks will be mined, especially <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/200/19734">after Ethereum Serenity 2.0 rolls out</a>. Timestamps may sometimes be off by 2 hours or so (if miners are malicious) but this shouldn’t seriously affect the window in a biased way if we’re talking about random samples and polling windows that last several days.</p>
<p>Periodically, the Intercoin app (or another dapp) running on one or more servers somewhere can watch the <code>VotingContract</code> on the blockchain and find out if the user has recently become eligible to vote in the poll. It then sends a notification, sms or email to the user, with a link to the poll. Upon receiving it, the user would typically have a bunch of time to visit the link and cast their vote. Rather than having the smart contract waste gas looping through a ton of previous block hashes and execute the <code>eligible()</code> function, the client dapp interface helpfully submits the <code>blockNumber</code> together with the vote. The smart contract them simply verifies the eligibility before allowing the vote to proceed.</p>
<p>The <code>eligible()</code> function takes into account <code>blockNumber</code>, but also the <code>memberCount</code> from <code>CommunityContract</code> and <code>fraction</code> of them that can vote in any given window. The <code>eligible()</code> function must be continuous in the latter two variables, since e.g. <code>memberCount</code> of a community can change between the time the user learns they can vote, and then when their transaction is finally mined.</p>
<p><strong>What Can They Vote For?</strong></p>
<p>Our <code>VotingContract</code> is designed to be a general-purpose smart contract, to work with many types of elections, referendums, and polls. Those who are eligible to vote will call:</p>
<pre><code>contract VotingContract {
   address externalContract;
   address externalMethod;
   uint fraction; // eligible people to vote in any given window, out of 1e10
   uint minimum; // minimum number of eligible people in any window

   function vote(VotingData data, uint eligibleBlock) {
     if (eligible(msg.sender)
     &amp;&amp; !hasVotedSince(msg.sender, eligibleBlock)) {
        // valid vote as far as eligibility and voting once
        // but external contract might roll back this transaction
        // if the vote contains invalid data, for instance
        externalContract.call(
          abi.encodeWithSignature(
             concat(externalMethod, "(uint256,uint256)"), 
             data
          )
        );
     }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>VotingData</code> is a <code>struct</code> that can contain arbitrary properties, which are interpreted by the <code>externalMethod</code> of the <code>externalContract</code>, which may choose to <code>rollback()</code> the transaction. It is not the business of <code>VotingContract</code> about <em><strong>how</strong></em> the vote is interpreted. It may be tallied in various ways (First past the post, <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting-versus-irv/">ranked choice, approval vote</a>) and it may be a vote among two or more candidates (although for more than two, keep in mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</a>). For example, the <code>IncomeContract</code> can use the <code>VotingContract</code> and <code>CommunityContract</code> to allow a community to vote on whether the level of UBI should go up or down by 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Profiles</strong></p>
<p>The set of threat profiles for an election or poll differs from, say, a banking app. Although both require security, in the banking app:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are managing relatively large amounts of money which are dear to them, and therefore take care to make sure their transaction was properly executed</li>
<li>people use the app that the bank releases, cryptographically signs and distributes on the app store or the web through https</li>
<li>people trust the bank and the bank is prepared to reverse individual transactions through chargebacks and fraud investigations</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, with a voting app:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are casting one vote in a sea of votes, and it won’t harm them much if only their transaction was executed incorrectly, so most won’t check</li>
<li>if everyone used a particular app to cast their vote, the creator of the app could be compromised, and no one voter would be incentivized to check</li>
<li>people trust a system consisting of multiple actors, which is not prepared to let only some people recast their votes and not others</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of 1 and 2 with voting means that most people won’t bother to check that their vote was properly recorded, and even if they do, they won’t know about everyone else whose vote may have been recorded incorrectly. A malicious actor could create a voting app that a large portion of the community ends up using, and this voting app might <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV_c1-YTk8M">switch the …</a></p></div></div>

Experienced Python developers might recognize some of them. However, others will still be unknown. Regardless, I find all of them very cool.</p>

<h2 id="yc4ulma"><code>...</code></h2>
<p>Yes, you’re reading it right, <code>...</code> is a valid construct in Python. <code>...</code> is a singleton object called <code>Ellipsis</code>. If you type it into the Python interpreter, you can actually see it:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>...
<span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis">official docs</a> , <code>Ellipsis</code> is a "special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types.". There’s two major use cases for it. One is to serve as a placeholder body in an empty function. The other is on <code>Numpy</code>, as a slice item, just as described in the docs.</p>
<h3 id="function-placeholder">Function Placeholder</h3>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>pass</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Beware, I'm not saying that <code>pass</code> == <code>...</code>, I'm just saying that as a function body, the outcome is the same. In fact, you can use anything as placeholder.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>"An empty, but also awesome function"</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="numpy">Numpy</h3>
<p>The code below basically means create an array of matrices. Each matrix is 3x3. Then get the second column (numpy arrays are 0-based) of all innermost matrix.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array = np.arange(<span>27</span>).reshape(<span>3</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array
array([[[ <span>0</span>,  <span>1</span>,  <span>2</span>],
        [ <span>3</span>,  <span>4</span>,  <span>5</span>],
        [ <span>6</span>,  <span>7</span>,  <span>8</span>]],

       [[ <span>9</span>, <span>10</span>, <span>11</span>],
        [<span>12</span>, <span>13</span>, <span>14</span>],
        [<span>15</span>, <span>16</span>, <span>17</span>]],

       [[<span>18</span>, <span>19</span>, <span>20</span>],
        [<span>21</span>, <span>22</span>, <span>23</span>],
        [<span>24</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>26</span>]]])
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array[..., <span>1</span>] 
array([[ <span>1</span>,  <span>4</span>,  <span>7</span>],
       [<span>10</span>, <span>13</span>, <span>16</span>],
       [<span>19</span>, <span>22</span>, <span>25</span>]])
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array[:, :, <span>1</span>] 
array([[ <span>1</span>,  <span>4</span>,  <span>7</span>],
       [<span>10</span>, <span>13</span>, <span>16</span>],
       [<span>19</span>, <span>22</span>, <span>25</span>]])
</code></pre>
<p>Beware: Python's list doesn't work with <code>...</code>. </p>
<h2 id="an-elegant-unpacking">An Elegant Unpacking</h2>
<p>Iterable unpacking is a remarkably convenient feature and has been there for a while. Most people use it to unpack iterables with multiple items. As example, consider the following use cases.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, *b, c = range(<span>1</span>, <span>11</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
[<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Or just:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, b, c = range(<span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>0</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>2</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But one nice use case that many people do not take advantage of is unpacking a single iterable. Why this is useful? It makes the code a little bit more elegant, IMHO.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = lst[<span>0</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>(a, ) = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>[a] = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I know that it may seem silly, but at least to me, it looks more elegant.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-flat-this-list">Can You Flat This List?</h2>
<p>Flattening a list can be done in several ways. The simplest one is using list comprehension. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>], [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened = [elem <span>for</span> sublist <span>in</span> l <span>for</span> elem <span>in</span> sublist]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>If you're more inclined to functional programming, you can use a reducer.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> reduce
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>reduce(<span>lambda</span> x,y: x+y,l)
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>However, there's yet another way. You can use the <code>sum</code> function!</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, [])
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>This works because the <code>sum</code> function iterates through each element in the list and concatenates them with the default value you pass as the second argument. Since lists in Python can be concatenated with <code>+</code> operator, then you get something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, []) ==&gt; [] + [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>] + [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>] + [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Even though this trick is brilliant, it’s by no means readable. Also, it has a terrible performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we do this with string?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, Python forbids doing the same with strings, even though you can concatenated strings with <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s = [<span>"abc"</span>, <span>"def"</span>, <span>"ghf"</span>]

<h2 id="the">The <code>_</code></h2>
<p>This one is really interesting and very handy when working with the REPL. It not only works with the default Python interpreter, but with IPython as well.</p>
<p>Whenever you run an expression in the REPL, Python binds the output to the <code>_</code> variable. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>nums = [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>7</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(nums)
<span>11</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>_
<span>11</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>_</code> is a variable like any other, you can re-bind it, or do anything else with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>9</span> + _
<span>20</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = _
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>20</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-else">What <code>else</code>?</h2>
<p>The <code>else</code> statement in can serve several purposes. Few people know, but you can use it outside the classical ‘if else` block. Python allow it to be used on loops and also on exception blocks.</p>
<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>Python has two different loops, <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>. Both of them can be "broken". That is, if a certain condition is met, we can break out of the loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>7</span>]: <span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
   ...:     <span>if</span> a == <span>3</span>:
   ...:         print(<span>"a == 3. exiting loop."</span>)
   ...:         <span>break</span>
   ...:     a += <span>1</span>
   ...: 
a == <span>3.</span> exiting loop.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's say that we are looking for a particular condition. If that condition is satisfied, we save the result in a flag called <code>found</code>. Then, if we don't find it, we print a message.</p>
<pre><code>found = <span>False</span>
a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        found = <span>True</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>if</span> <span>not</span> found:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>a</code> never becomes 12, the program outputs <code>a was never found</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, but how can we use <code>else</code> in this context?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>else</code> can be used to replace the flag. Basically, what we actually want is to run the loop and, if not found, then print a message. This is how it looks like with <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And since it works with any loop, you can use a <code>for</code> instead of <code>while</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> a <span>in</span> range(<span>10</span>):
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>The <code>else</code> in Python is so versatile that you can even use it in a <code>try ... except</code> block. The idea here is to capture a nonoccurrence of an exception. </p>
<pre><code>In [<span>13</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Key <span>is</span> missing
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we try looking up a key named “lala” in an empty dictionary. Since “lala” is not there, the code will raise an <code>KeyError</code> exception. When I run this snippet in <code>IPython</code>, I got an expected result.</p>
<p>What about a case where the program raises no exception?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>14</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {<span>'lala'</span>: <span>'bla'</span>}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Else here
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can see it in action. The <code>{’lala’: ‘bla’}[‘lala’]</code> block won’t raise <code>KeyError</code>, so the <code>else</code> comes into play. </p>
<p>Remember, few people know this, so I personally avoid using this feature to not confuse other developers working in the same code base. It’s nice to impress friends, though!</p>
<h2 id="comparing-things-like-a-boss">Comparing Things Like a Boss</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorites and not so hidden, to be honest. Unlike many programming languages, like <code>Java</code>, <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code>, Python allows you to chain comparison operators. Let's imagine that you have a variable <code>x</code> that holds the value of <code>10</code>. Now, let's say that you want to assert that <code>x</code> is within a range, like 5..20, inclusive. You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>16</span>]: x = <span>10</span>
In [<span>17</span>]: <span>if</span> x &gt;= <span>5</span> <span>and</span> x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out, this can be simplified by chaining the operators. So, we can refactor the code to this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>18</span>]: <span>if</span> <span>5</span> &lt;= x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>This code achieves the exact same result, but it's much more elegant. You can chain using any kind of comparison operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x &gt; <span>1</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x &lt; <span>20</span> &lt; x*<span>10</span> &lt; <span>1000</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Very cool!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s the end of this post. Python is a very friendly language and has some nice, but not well-known, features. In this post, I showed you my favorites and I hope you’ve learned something new. See you next time!</p>

  <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

  <p>An encouraging development in the education of programmers in recent years has been a renewed interest in the relationship between programming, logic and abstract algebra. Recent enthusiasm over functional programming is no doubt the main motivation behind this happy development.</p>

  <p>However, this interest is at times accompanied by a kind of awed appreciation of this relationship, perhaps among practitioner enthusiasts, who consider it almost miraculous, more than among academics. Some researchers notable for popularizing the interest in this relationship encourage this view with talk of “computational trinitarianism” and statements like, “this is further proof that mathematics is discovered rather than invented,” one <a href="http://archive.is/3wgAM">going so far</a> as to call the relationship “a manifestation of the divine” and to say that “all three have ontological force; they codify what is, not how to describe what is already given to us. In this sense they are foundational; if we suppose that they are merely <em>descriptive</em>, we would be left with the question of where these previously given concepts arise, leading us back again to foundations”. Another has <a href="https://vimeo.com/242784236">said</a>,<sup id="fnref:milewski"><a href="#fn:milewski">1</a></sup> “Have you heard of the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism? … These three different theories … were developed separately — constructive logic, typed lambda calculus, and category theory — and the isomorphism says that these are actually <em>identical</em>. Why do these three completely separate theories have the same structure? Because all three of them are about composability.” While he is not too far off the mark when he later says, “Maybe we are just discovering the way our brains work. … [I]f mathematics is all about composition, then composition is something that our brains came up with in order to deal with complexity,” the truth is far simpler yet more interesting, even if less mysterious.</p>

  <p>Awed wonder is a powerful marketing tool, but it mystifies rather than clarifies, and fosters a kind of magical thinking in a field that strives to be most at odds with it (although, as we’ll see in part 2, it sometimes fails). The goal of mathematics is to simplify, not to wow. This attitude towards that — quite obvious, as we’ll see — relationship also distracts from the actual, less obvious, discoveries made. The existence of this relationship was not among them; it was not the denouement — it was the setup. Confusing the two muddles the very essence of any story.</p>

  <p>I also believe that it is this very attitude that puts the focus on the chosen mathematical abstractions rather than on the things they describe creates an atmosphere where there can only be one True interpretation — even one with three personas. I call this absolutist view that confuses the peculiarities of a method of observation with those of the observed system and so denies alternative interpretations the “Protestant” view, and it is a hindrance to understanding logic, where truth is, almost by definition, always relative to a specific system. As Alonzo Church wrote in the very paper he first introduced the λ-calculus<sup id="fnref:church0"><a href="#fn:church0">2</a></sup>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We do not attach any character of uniqueness or absolute truth to any particular system of logic. The entities of formal logic are abstractions, invented because of their use in describing and systematizing facts of experience or observation, and their properties, determined in rough outline by this intended use, depend for their exact character on the arbitrary choice of the inventor… [T]here exist, undoubtedly, more than one formal system whose use as a logic is feasible, and of these systems one may be more pleasing or more convenient than another, but it cannot be said that one is right and the other wrong.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following text will attempt to demistify this relationship between computation, logic and abstract algebra. Category theory is a generalization of the last, but programming languages are sometimes interchangeably assigned to both the second, logic, and the first, computation, thus adding to the confusion. In my view, programming languages (at least when studied in a theoretical context) strictly belong to the second persona of logic, and not at all to the first, computation, other than by virtue of the ordinary relationship between the three; programming languages are no more related to computation than formal logic is. I <a href="https://pron.github.io/posts/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-computation">have previously written</a> about the distinction between programming and computation and the misunderstanding caused by confusing the two, and I hope that this text will clarify the matter further.</p>

  <p>While I will not opine on whether or not mathematical objects have “an ontological force”, as the Platonic ontology of mathematics is a matter of debate in the philosophy of mathematics — a fascinating field, but not a focus of this discussion — I will show that they are not only very much descriptive, but that <em>what</em> they attempt to describe, and therefore how they arise, has been explicitly stated by the originators of those ideas. There is nothing incidental, miraculous, surprising or “divine” in the relationship between computation, logic and algebra; rather, nothing is more creatively human than the process that led to their correlation, and while some things in mathematics are perhaps discovered, logic and algebra were <em>invented</em>, and rather than carrying an independent “foundational ontological force”, they were devised to <em>describe</em> a physical phenomenon (although I do not claim that the mathematical systems invented may not <em>also</em> correspond to some Truth). In particular, I will show that computation, logic and algebra were studied as a single subject for most of their relevant history, related in the following way: human reason works by computation, logic is a description of the process of reasoning, and algebra is the mathematical modeling of logic. The three began to separate into different disciplines only towards the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Logic was separated from algebra by Gottlob Frege, immediately triggering the criticism that the correspondence between the two is an argument for having only one. Frege responded that there would <em>obviously</em> be a correspondence between the two because he had invented one to describe the same thing as the other, but that one can translate between two modes of expression does not mean that one of them is redundant. Computation separated from logic some decades later as a more foundational or primitive concept, while exposing the fact that the basic principles of how logic supposedly described human reason — which Gottfried Leibniz called the “Art of Combination” — hadn’t changed for literally millennia, and while logicians/algebraists declared themselves to be studying the computation in the human mind, they were actually just modeling a very particular, and ancient, <em>view</em> of human reason that they had taken on unquestionable faith. The systems were in such harmonious correspondence not just because they described the same physical phenomenon, but because they all <em>re</em>-described the <em>same ancient description</em> of that phenomenon.</p>

  <p>While researching the topic — not being a logician or a historian, but rather a programmer and an amateur interested in the history of mathematics — I was surprised how explicit this connection was made from the very beginning of the disciplines. Quite the opposite of accidental or miraculous, calling this relationship obvious is an <em>understatement</em>. That there is some relationship between a house cat and a leopard can be said to be obvious; the one between the original Star Wars trilogy and its many prequels and sequels is much more than just obvious. If you think that it is in any way accidental or miraculous, or that it is proof that Darth Vader was discovered rather than invented, you are clearly missing something very important in understanding the meta-theory of stories — meaning, how they come to be. I delight at the opportunity to use the history of science — or of logic and mathematics in this case — to clarify the development of mathematical concepts by tracing their evolution and the creative process of their originators.</p>

  <p>This book-length text — and not a short book — is published as a three-part blog post series, but I personally wrote very little of it. While the text is not different in content or conclusions from books about the history of logic and computation (or the wonderful recent Atlantic article, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/"><em>How Aristotle Created the Computer</em></a>), it is certainly different in style, being comprised mostly of original sources. I chose to compose the text in this way for several reasons, listed here in no particular order: 1. I am not a professional historian and do not have sufficient knowledge to provide insight on historical trends. 2. I find reading (carefully selected) primary sources a lot more fun than sweeping descriptions. 3. As most mathematicians and programmers do not make good historians, a lot of inaccuracies and downright mistakes are perpetrated because few have seen the actual sources. 4. As my goal is to demystify logic and mathematics, I think it is especially enlightening to read how the originators of the ideas describe their process of arriving at their insight. My text is also different in focus; it attempts to emphasize the evolution of the connection …</p></div></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ff1f1677bf36496f03d8"><div><p>As most of the major media categories — music, video and video games — have existed for decades, we tend to forget that media is technology. Instead, we think of technology as being used to express media, rather than media itself. Spotify, for example, is an <em>internet</em> <em>streaming </em>music service, while iTunes is a <em>download </em>music service, SiriusXM is <em>satellite</em> <em>broadcast</em> music service, and radio is a <em>terrestrial broadcast</em> technology. This focus on delivery ignores the classic definition of media: “<span>outlets</span> or <span>tools</span> used to <span>store</span> and <span>deliver</span> information or data.”</p><p>While the above might seem preoccupied with theory and philosophy, all analysis of the past and future of a given media category must start from the fact that media is technology. This is because technology not only enables content categories, it defines their business models and shapes the content, too. And as we know, technology is in a constant process of change. </p><p><strong>Chapter 1: How Technology Created Recorded Media, Then Continually Redefined It</strong></p><p>Music offers a great view into the interplay between technology, business model and content. Consider the following triptych, which covers seven decades, two decades and one year, respectively.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602797899091_5458"><div><p>&nbsp;When the flat record first emerged in the 1850s, it standardized around the 78. The 78 (as in 78 rotations per minute) came in a 10-inch version that held three minutes of music and a 12-inch version that held four. This meant that after centuries of variability, music suddenly had a defined run-time.&nbsp;</p><p>This length was reaffirmed by the first mass market standard for consumer media: the 45 RPM vinyl single, which launched in 1948 and held roughly three minutes. The music industry coalesced around this format (and its runtime) for a variety of tech-based reasons. The 45 was far cheaper for consumers than a 78 album, which was important given the high cost of record players and the ubiquity of free (singles-focused) radio. The 45’s cost advantage also meant it was the primary way labels delivered singles to thousands of radio stations across the country for local airplay. In addition, RCA quickly figured out how to make a stackable version of 45s, which was important to jukebox manufacturers. The rise of the 45 naturally led the length of the average song to decline; a four-minute song simply couldn’t fit on the most important audio format in the world.</p><p>As the physical and financial limitations of the 78 and 45 were relieved, and the far more flexible cassette and CD emerged, the length of the average single grew rapidly, adding nearly two minutes (or 78%) from 1959 to 1992. Still, almost all tracks conformed to the three-to-four minute standard. After decades, the West had become used to the idea that a song was roughly between three minutes and 20 seconds and four minutes and 10 seconds long.</p><p>On its surface, the shift to digital audio should have led to further increases in song length. After all, there was no longer any limitation to run-time. However, the reverse occurred. Technology might have relaxed its grip on music’s length, but it had strengthened its hold on business models.</p><p>As is well known, iTunes unbundled the physical album in individually downloadable (and bought) tracks. But in doing so, it penalized artists for bundling a multi-part song into a single track. Pink Floyd’s decision to split the 26-minute and nine-part Shine on You Crazy Diamond into two discrete tracks didn’t matter in 1975; all nine parts fit on a single record and no one wanted to buy just a single half let alone a single part. But in 2005, such a move could mean missing out on 75% of revenues — why sell two things when you could sell nine? And why would a consumer buy an entire $10 album if all they wanted was two $1 portions of Shine on You Crazy Diamond? These incentives naturally led to artists that were publishing new music to split their longer/multi-section songs into separate — and shorter — preludes, interludes and segments.</p><p>This behaviour has been greatly exacerbated by the advent of a new and even more disruptive digital music technology: on-demand streaming. While iTunes was technically innovative, its business model was not. Consumers, after all, primarily owned copies of individual tracks in the 1950s and 1960s. Spotify and Apple Music, meanwhile, meant consumers adopted not just a new music technology, but also bought an entirely different product: ongoing access to all music ever created.</p><p>But as technology has shifted consumers away from discrete and attributable transactions (buying record A on date B) to ongoing and general ones (subscribing to service C in perpetuity), musical talent needed a new compensation model. Spotify, therefore, decided to pay talent as and to the degree consumers listened to their works. Matching revenue with usage is intuitive, but it was never before possible in music. There was no way to track at-home record spins or CD plays, let alone charge for them. Nor was it practical for iTunes to ask users to download an individual song to their devices and pay several pennies per play when they later synched their iPod to iTunes. (This would have been rife with abuse, too.)</p><p>Engagement-based monetization is arguably more fair. Consider, for example, that the Beatles’ <em>Yesterday </em>and Psy’s <em>Gangnam Style</em> would each generate $1 when sold on iTunes, even if the former was played 2,000 times over ten years and the latter 30 times in the month it was bought and then never again. But the more that business models change, the more that incentives and content change, too.</p><p>To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties.&nbsp;</p><p>So as the music industry has transitioned the majority of its revenues from CDs and downloads to streaming, major artists have relentlessly shortened and split their tracks. Why release a five-minute song if you can make it a two and a half-minute song that’s played twice? Or two different two and a half-minute songs? This meant artists had yet another reason to reduce track lengths</p><p>All of this helps to explain the extraordinary success of the 2019’s top track, <em>Old Town Road </em>by Lil Nas X, which is also Billboard’s longest running #1 ever, at 19 consecutive weeks. While the song is awesome, it’s also only one minute and 53 seconds — roughly half of 2019’s average song length. This means that four minutes of listening generated two times the average revenue and charting lift of every other hit song that year.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t an exception, either. Up until 2017, Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart has never had a year with more than 2% of its charting tracks shorter than two minutes and 30 seconds (most years had none). In the past three years, this sum has skyrocketed to over 12%, or roughly one in every eight tracks.</p><p>Notably, labels are also encouraging artists to simplify the name of their songs and albums in order to ensure they’re optimized for voice-controlled speakers and touchscreen-based searches. A track with five words is more likely to be misunderstood or suffer from autocorrect than one with two. Similarly, voice assistants are known to struggle with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/voice-is-the-next-big-platform-unless-you-have-an-accent/">accents</a>, such as Irish or even Texan. Being hard to say means you might not get played.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t the first time technology made a hit. In fact, the modern day dominance of rap and R&amp;B comes from how changes in technology – not for delivery, but sales recognition –&nbsp; afforded Lil Nas X the opportunity to top the charts in the first place.</p><p>Prior to the 1990s, Black artists and music fans had spent decades arguing the record industry conspired against “urban contemporary” music by refusing it radio play and ignoring its sales. It took only five weeks after Billboard adopted SoundScan, a computerized sales database, to prove this theory right.</p><p>Until 1991, Billboard charts weren’t based on actual unit sales or radio play. Instead, it was assembled using (white) retail clerk estimates of what was selling best and what (white) DJs considered to be “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/">hottest</a>” each week. According to <em>The Atlantic</em>, both groups had<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/"> reasons to lie</a>. For example, labels would pressure radio stations to favour “hand-picked hits” if they wanted to keep receiving the newest single on time (stations sometimes<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola"> received bribes to play specific tracks</a>, too). Meanwhile, labels would force inventory on their retailers, who would then overreport sales to convince music fans to buy excess inventory.</p><p>Naturally, those who ran the music industry saw little need to overhaul how it worked. And thus while the book and film industries had shifted to computerized sales databases in the 1980s, not one of the top six record distributors signed onto SoundScan before its release in June 1991. But this resistance didn’t stop N.W.A.’s <em>N***az4life</em> from debuting #2 on the Billboard Top 100 the very next month under SoundScan. This was the highest charting performance in rap history – and happened without any radio airplay, music video airings on MTV, or a concert tour. The failings of the old honour system were further demonstrated by the fact that N.W.A. debuted at only #21 on Billboard’s R&amp;B chart, which wasn’t yet on SoundScan. Somehow it was possible that <em>N***az4life</em> was the second biggest album in the country by units purchased, but 21st in its own genre when it came to what was “selling” and “hottest.” One week after it’s release, the album hit #1 on the Billboard chart (displacing R.E.M) as hundreds …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

            <h2>Fun with Combinators</h2>

            <p>
    Posted on October 17, 2020
</p>





<p>There are a bunch of “minimal” computational models out there: Turing machines, lambda calculus, PowerPoint <span data-cites="wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017">(Wildenhain <a href="#ref-wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, etc. These are radically simple languages which are nonetheless Turing complete, so theoretically “as powerful” as each other. Of those, lambda calculus is without question my favourite to actually write programs in: it’s the one which is closest to crawling out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit">Turing tarpit</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, though, it is <em>far</em> from simple. Lambda calculus has <em>variables</em>, which introduce huge complexity into the interpreter: especially if you want to do any kind of formal reasoning about programs, this complexity is a problem. We might want to reach for something even lower-level than lambda calculus: this is where combinator calculi come in.</p>
<p>You may have heard of SKI combinator calculus: it’s the “simplest” of the calculi, but it’s not actually very easy to understand, and it’s absolute murder to try use. So we’re going to start with <code>BCKW</code>, a more obscure calculus, actually invented by Haskell Curry.</p>
<p>There are 4 combinators in <code>BCKW</code>: <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code> (shocking, I know). You can think about these combinators as functions which manipulate the beginning of strings:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Kxy  ~&gt; x
Wxy  ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>Let’s work with some examples to get a sense for how these combinators work.</p>
<p>Upper case letters are combinators, lower-case are variables. Yes, yes, I know I said that combinator calculi didn’t need variables, and it doesn’t! I’m just using them here to explain how each of the combinators work. If you really want to be pedantic you can think of the lower case letters as notational placeholders meaning “any given combinator”. They won’t exist in any actual programs we write.</p>
<p>The simplest combinator is <code>K</code>: it’s actually equivalent to the <code>const</code> function from Haskell. It discards its second argument, and returns the first. If you give a combinator more arguments than it usually accepts, you just keep the extra arguments in the output:</p>
<pre><code>Kxyz ~&gt; xz</code></pre>
<p><code>W</code> is the next combinator: it <em>duplicates</em> its second argument.</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>We always start from the <em>left</em>, applying the rule for the left-most combinator first.</p>
<pre><code>WKxyz ~&gt; Kxxyz ~&gt; xyz
KWxyz ~&gt; Wyz   ~&gt; yzz</code></pre>
<p>Next we have <code>C</code>: this is equivalent to the Haskell function <code>flip</code>. It swaps the second and third arguments:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a small little evaluator for expressions which use <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code>. You can edit the expression, and press enter to step through it.</p>



<p>The last combinator introduces parentheses, and it’s equivalent to function composition.</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)</code></pre>
<p>You can write parentheses yourself: implicitly, all expressions are left-associative. That means that the following are all equal:</p>
<pre><code>xyz = (xy)z = (x)yz = ((x)y)z</code></pre>
<p>But <code>xyz</code> is <em>not</em> equal to, say, <code>x(yz)</code>.</p>
<p>And here’s a puzzle to start flexing your combinator skills: one of the combinators in SKI combinator calculus is <code>I</code>, which is the identity function.</p>
<pre><code>Ix ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Try write an expression which functions the same way as <code>I</code>, using only the <code>BCKW</code> combinators. Use the following evaluator to try and figure out how to do it: write an expression after <code>λ&gt;</code> which functions the same as <code>I</code>.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>CK</code> followed by any combinator will do the trick. So <code>CKB</code>, <code>CKK</code>, <code>CKC</code>, etc.
<pre><code>I = CKC</code></pre>
Update 19/10/2020: A few people have pointed out (<a href="https://www.joachim-breitner.de/">Joachim Breitner</a> was the first) that there is a shorter solution to this problem: <code>WK</code>. I tend to prefer solutions that don’t include <code>W</code>, since then we’re working in a subset of the language that is both terminating and affine; although in this case the reason I didn’t mention <code>WK</code> is that I just didn’t find it myself.
</details>

<p>Each of the combinators we’ve defined so far work a little weird: they seem to skip over their first argument, and work on their second. Indeed, there is another, equivalent combinator calculus which doesn’t have this peculiarity:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Axy  ~&gt; y
Mx   ~&gt; xx
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p><code>B</code> stays the same in this calculus, but the rest of the combinators get switched out for seemingly simpler versions. <code>K</code> goes to <code>A</code><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre><code>Axy ~&gt; y
Kxy ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Which isn’t a huge change. It’s the other two where we see the real difference. <code>W</code> has been swapped out for <code>M</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy
Mx  ~&gt; xx</code></pre>
<p>As you can see <code>W</code> basically does the same thing as <code>M</code>, but while passing through its first argument. The difference between <code>T</code> and <code>C</code> is similar:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p>So, first of all, it is pretty simple to show that <code>BCKW</code> contains all of the <code>BAMT</code> combinators. Try find a way to write <code>T</code> using only <code>BCKW</code> combinators (hint: you might want to use your previous answer for writing <code>I</code> using <code>BCKW</code>).</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> So in fact all of the changed <code>BAMT</code> combinators can be encoded using <code>BCKW</code> by putting <code>I</code> (or <code>CKC</code> or what have you) after the corresponding <code>BCKW</code> combinator. In other words:
<pre><code>T = CI = C(CKC)
A = KI = K(CKC)
M = WI = W(CKC)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>It’s pretty easy to go from <code>BCKW</code> to <code>BAMT</code>, then. However, it’s <em>extremely</em> difficult to go the other way. Here, try to write <code>K</code> in terms of <code>BAMT</code> (this is quite difficult, do not expect to get it!):</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> Either of the following would work:
<pre><code>B(TA)(BBT)
B(B(TA)B)T</code></pre>
</details>
<p>So this is why we will stick to <code>BCKW</code> for the time being: <code>BAMT</code> is just too painful to use.</p>

<p>One of the things <code>BCKW</code> has over <code>SKI</code> is that each combinator represents a concrete capability. <code>K</code> and <code>W</code> especially: without these combinators, we can neither duplicate nor discard variables. This makes the languages without one or both of these interesting (albeit not Turing-complete).</p>
<p>If we say that we can’t use <code>W</code>, we know that the will not duplicate any input. In fact, encoded appropriately, we know that the program can only decrease its size through execution. The <code>BCK</code> system is in fact an encoding of <em>affine</em> logic, which is all the rage nowadays. Rust uses affine types to guarantee memory safety: by preventing duplication of references, you can know that whenever you’re looking at a variable you’re free to modify it, or destroy it if necessary (obviously Rust is a bit more complex than what I’ve described here, but <code>BCK</code> is indeed the fundamental basis for the system in the same way that <code>SK</code> can be the basis for any programming language).</p>
<p>If we remove <code>K</code> as well we have a <em>linear</em> language. This is even more restrictive, but is also quite actively researched at the moment: linear types have been used to construct languages for differential privacy, for instance.</p>
<p>There’s one small issue with <code>BC</code>: it doesn’t (strictly speaking) have an equivalent to <code>I</code>. You can write an expression which is <em>close</em>, but it will only actually compute when applied to at least 3 arguments. See if you can find it.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>BCC</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Usually we add <code>I</code>, though, to give us <code>BCI</code>.</p>

<p><code>S</code> is the only combinator we haven’t seen yet. It’s kind of a combination of <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>W</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Sxyz ~&gt; xz(yz)</code></pre>
<p>It does parenthesising, reordering, <em>and</em> duplication. This allows it to be powerful to be Turing complete only with the addition of <code>K</code>. Try first to construct <code>I</code> given only <code>S</code> and <code>K</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>SK</code> followed by any combinator will suffice.
<pre><code>I = SKK = SKS</code></pre>
</details>
<p>And now construct <code>S</code> from <code>BCKW</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = B(BW)(BBC) = B(B(BW)C)(BB)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Of course, to show that <code>SK</code> is universal we’d need to show that it contains one of the other universal systems. We won’t do that exhaustively here, but first just try to figure out <code>B</code> and <code>W</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>B = S(KS)K</code></pre>
</details>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = SS(SK) = SS(KI)</code></pre>
</details>

<p>The next task is to encode the <code>Y</code> combinator. This is a combinator that evaluates to the following:</p>
<pre><code>Yf ~&gt; f(Yf)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it encodes <em>recursion</em>. Like the <code>fix</code> function in Haskell, this combinator allows us to do recursion without explicit self-reference. And, of course, we can define this combinator using the combinators we’ve seen before, since our language is Turing complete. One encoding is <code>BM(CBM)</code>:</p>



<p>As you can see, <code>BM(CBM)</code>, when applied to <code>f</code>, yields <code>f(M(CBMf))</code>, which is equivalent to <code>f(BM(CBM)f)</code> (the <code>B</code> just hasn’t been applied inside the <code>f</code>). So this is indeed a proper recursion combinator.</p>

<p>Let’s try doing a little bit of programming with these combinators now.</p>
<p>In the lambada calculus, to encode numbers we often use the <em>church</em> numerals: that’s what we’re going to do here, too. A church numeral representing some number <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> is a function which takes two arguments, and applies the first argument to the second <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> times. Here are some church numerals in Haskell:</p>
<pre><code>zero :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
zero f x = x

one :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
one f x = f x

two :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
two f x = f (f x)

three :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
three f x = f (f (f x))</code></pre>
<p>Encoding these numerals in combinators is a little more difficult. Zero and one are obvious: they are <code>A</code> and <code>I</code>, respectively. Try to figure out two and three:</p>

<p>It turns out that it’s pretty easy to encode numbers in a relatively small amount of space, using a binary encoding. First, multiplication on Church numerals is simply composition: so that’s <code>B</code> on our combinators. We already have 2 defined, so the next thing we need for a binary encoding is a successor function. And we know what <em>that</em> is, from the answer to 3!</p>
<p>This means we can encode normal number in <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mo>log</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(\log n)</annotation></semantics></math> space (although it still takes linear time to evaluate). The following repl allows for numbers:</p>


<p>We could take up even less space if we allowed for non-normal forms. 4, for instance, could be encoded like so:</p>
<pre><code>M(WB)</code></pre>
<p>But we generally prefer to keep our encodings in normal form: otherwise there’s some extra evaluation we have to pay for when we go to use them.</p>

<p>Once upon a time SKI combinators were used as a target for functional compilers: Miranda, Haskell’s precursor, compiled down to a set of combinators which included <code>SKI</code>. Nowadays, Haskell is compiled to the “spineless tagless G-machine”: its compilation technique took over from combinators in the late 80s, and has been the dominant form since. Apparently the reason is that, on the current architecture of most computers, combinator-based compilation targets just aren’t fast enough. They generate too much garbage: as a result, …</p></div></div>

		<div>

			<p>Following <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a> on forcing Mainland China DNS service upon Hong Kong WiFi users, this part analyzes how the periodic DNS queries on <code>qq.com</code>, as seen by users capturing the DNS queries, are generated from the recent Samsung phones firmware (as at Sept 2020) when WiFi is used.</p>

<blockquote><p>tl;dr: These queries are sent simultaneously to all DNS servers registered for the WiFi connection, including <code>114.114.114.114</code> when it is added under circumstances as examined in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a>. They are generated every 20 to 60 seconds (depending on settings and link conditions) when the following pre-conditions are satisfied, i.e. WiFi is connected (except with some known devices) with <code>mCurrentMode</code> not equals 0 (elaborated at the bottom of this article), and when screen is on.&nbsp; The queries are sent directly using the WiFi connection link, without going through the VPN / private DNS configured, presumably as they are intended for testing the WiFi network.&nbsp; The IP addresses returned by the queries are not further used, except for checking if they are in a private IP range (in which case the checking is deemed failed).</p></blockquote>
<p>The following is a technical (read: very boring) account of the findings. Jump to the end for hints to disable the DNS query for your home WiFi.</p>
<p>For better illustration of the source, a new Github repository showing the decompiled version of the same <code>wifi-service.jar</code> as in Part I has been created. It uses a different mode of the decompiler (JADX) to attempt to decompile more code to Java, even when there are issues in correctness. The repository is at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1">SM-N9750-TGY-1</a>.</p>
<h3>The main players</h3>
<p>The main controlling class for the logic is again under <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>.</p>
<p>As briefly mentioned in the last part, this class implements a state machine which represents the status of the WiFi connection being monitored. The states accept messages and respond to them by taking actions and / or transition into another state.</p>
<p>Separately, a subclass, <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, is responsible for the monitoring of the connectivity and signal strength. The analyzer is an Android <code>Handler</code> which consumes messages in an event loop. These messages can be sent by the parent state machine, from within the analyzer itself, or from other subclasses, to control the activities of the analyzer.</p>
<p>The most relevant messages in our context are defined as follows (unless otherwise specified, the line numbers are those of the <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a> file in the decompiled code):</p>
<p>Messages sent to the Analyzer to control the lifecycle of the checking loop (lines 115-117, 254):</p>
<pre>    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL = 135221;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_START = 135219;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP = 135220;
     ...
    private static final int NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS = 135223;
</pre>
<p>Messages representing external events sent to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine (lines 205-206).</p>
<pre>    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_OFF = 135177;
    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_ON = 135176;
</pre>
<h3>Let the query loop start</h3>
<p>When the phone screen is turned on, Android will send the <code>android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON</code> intent to the network receiver of this class (line 1149), which will in turn send <code>EVENT_SCREEN_ON</code> to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine. If the state is under <code>EvaluatedState</code> [Note 1], the <code>processMessage()</code> method, around line 2138, handles the message (for brevity, some reference to <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> in the code is omitted):</p>
<pre>    
case EVENT_SCREEN_ON:  //135176 
...
if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    sendMessage(obtainMessage(135188 /* CMD_RSSI_FETCH */, mRssiFetchToken, 0) ;
    if (isValidState() &amp;&amp; getCurrentState() != mLevel2State) {
        if (mNetworkStatsAnalyzer != null) {
            mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START); // 135219
        }
        startEleCheck();
    }
    if (mCurrentMode == 1 || mLinkDetectMode == 1) {
        sendMessage(obtainMessage(CMD_TRAFFIC_POLL/*135193*/, mTrafficPollToken, 0);
    }
}
...
</pre>
<p>This means that, when <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, WiFi is connected, and the connection is not with some known devices, it will send the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> message to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. (It will also perform other actions, like calling <code>startEleCheck()</code> to discover devices, but these are not relevant to our context.)</p>
<p>The message <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> from a few other places. Here is an extract of the <code>enter()</code> method of the <code>Valid</code> state, triggered when <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> enters <code>Valid</code> state (i.e. upon WiFi connection) (line 3077-).</p>
<pre>if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    ...
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START);
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS);
}</pre>
<p><code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent when <code>mCurrentMode</code> switches from 0 to other values under <code>Valid</code> state (line 3112).&nbsp; Together, it is ensured that all paths arriving at the status, i.e. Wifi is connected, screen is on, and <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, will trigger <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>.</p>
<p>Note that upon entering the <code>Valid</code> state, <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. Let’s look at what this message does first.</p>
<h3>The NetworkStatsAnalyzer</h3>
<h4>The “loop” structure</h4>
<p>The below shows a skeleton of the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> handler loop handling the above messages, with bodies of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> and <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP</code> omitted for the moment. (lines 4157-, 4477-, 5107-)</p>
<pre>private class NetworkStatsAnalyzer extends Handler
{
    ...
    private boolean mDnsInterrupted = false;
    private boolean mDnsQueried = false;
    private long mLastDnsCheckTime = 0;
    private boolean mPollingStarted = false;
    private boolean mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
    private boolean mSkipRemainingDnsResults = false;
    
    ...
    public void handleMessage(Message string) {
        long now = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final long elapsedRealtime = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final WifiInfo wifiInfo = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.syncGetCurrentWifiInfo();
        final int what = string.what;
        switch (what) {
        ...
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_START:
                if (this.mPollingStarted) break;
                if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) break;
                if (this.isBackhaulDetectionEnabled()) {
                    this.sendEmptyMessage(TCP_BACKHAUL_DETECTION_START); // 135226
                }
                this.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
                WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.initNetworkStatHistory();
                this.mLastRssi = wifiInfo.getRssi();
                this.mPollingStarted = true;
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
                ...
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP:
                ...
                break;
            case NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS:
                if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) {
                    checkPublicDns();
                }
                break;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The message <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code>, sent upon WiFi connection, will invoke the method <code>checkPublicDns()</code> if the WiFi is not a mobile hotspot. The method is as follows (line 4262-).</p>
<pre>public void checkPublicDns() {
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
        mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
        return;
    }
    mPublicDnsCheckProcess = true;
    mNsaQcStep = 1;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor wifiConnectivityMonitor = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this;
    String str = wifiConnectivityMonitor.mParam.DEFAULT_URL_STRING;
    DnsThread mDnsThread = new DnsThread(true, str, this, 10000);
    mDnsThread.start();
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID = mDnsThread.getId();
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.DBG) {
        Log.d(TAG, "wait publicDnsThread results [" + WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID + "]");
    }
}</pre>
<p>We see the problematic <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> method as discussed in Part I being used. It can be seen that the above code handles the “normal” case outside China. Upon WiFi connection, it will start an asynchronous DNS query in a separate thread called <code>DnsThread</code>, using the address in the constant <code>DEFAULT_URL_STRING</code> (hardcoded to “www.google.com” as shown in Part I). This is done once at the start of every WiFi connection. However, if <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> returns true, e.g. in the case of a phone in Hong Kong, it would just set the flag <code>mPublicDnsCheckProcess</code> to false and return, skipping the DNS query for google.</p>
<p>Then we look at <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>. On receipt of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>, the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, among other actions, sends the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> message to itself, and sets the flag <code>mPollingStarted</code> to true. This would kick start the checking loop, as to be explained below. Before taking these actions, it would ensure that the loop is not already started by checking <code>mPollingStarted</code>, and that the WiFi connection is not acting as a hotspot.</p>
<p>The main flow controlling logic of the body of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> polling loop is as follows (line 4509-).</p>
<pre>case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.SMARTCM_DBG) {
    Log.i(TAG, "mPollingStarted : " + mPollingStarted);    
}
if (!mPollingStarted) {
    break;
}
if ((WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != null) &amp;&amp;
    (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mEmptyBssid)) {
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mIWCChannel.sendMessage(CMD_IWC_ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL); // 135376
    int rssi2 = wifiInfo.getRssi();
    if (rssi2 &lt; -90) {
        if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mClientModeImpl.isConnected()) {
            Log.i(TAG, "already disconnected : " + rssi2);
            removeMessages(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
            sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP);
            break;
        }
        if (rssi2 &lt; -95) {
            if (rssi2 == -127) break;
           …</pre></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I almost skipped writing this week’s post on my blog.</p><p>It was a tough week at work. And I only managed to hit my work goals for the week by pulling in extra hours on Saturday. </p><p>Exhausted, I was racking my brains on what should I write about.</p><p>In the weekly content brainstorm call with the DelightChat tribe on Friday, there were a few potential topics I talked about - Ask dumb questions, Life is not a zero sum game, Generalist vs Specialist - none of them flowed out of me like it does every week.</p><h2>How I write on my blog</h2><p>You see, every weekend when I sit down to write, the entire writeup just kinda flows in one continuous stream of thoughts. </p><p>A monologue but on paper.</p><p>But more importantly, what allows that to happen is that whatever I write about each weekend is a topic that naturally came up in my life - in my thoughts, readings, conversations with friends, with team members, with my co-founder, my girlfriend, or family members.</p><p>And because I would had lived and gone through the meat of the topic already, writing it down would feel natural and effortless.</p><p>This week when I tried to write on some of the topics mentioned above, I felt stuck. </p><p>Honestly, what I wrote after an hour of applied effort read like gibberish. </p><p>I told Sankalp that I’m not sure I’ll be able to write anything good this weekend, and his reply was - “The weekly content writing is supposed to be therapeutic and fun. It’s not supposed to be something you are forced to do.”</p><p>He was right, the purpose of this whole exercise is to release our thoughts, learnings, ideas from our minds onto paper and then to the whole world. And feel great in the process. I wasn’t feeling great.</p><p>But then my reply to Sankalp was - “I do want to write something. So I'll dedicate 2 hours to it and write the newsletter early morning. Keeping the consistency is important to me.”</p><h2>Consistency</h2><p>A few years ago, I was the sort of person who would have a string of habits, strict (and exhaustive) morning routines, a diary where I was checking off whether I performed my habits each day, you get the picture. </p><p>And if I ever missed a day or two of my habits or routines, my whole routine would break down. </p><p>My habits and routines were not anti-fragile, and I knew that was a problem.</p><p>The game changer for me was over a long conversation one evening, over a few drinks, with my friend Sandesh. He explained to me that I’m being too hard on myself, and that my system has a single point of failure which drags me down every time I hit it. I cannot let missing a day or two of routine breakdown the whole routine.</p><p>“So how do you do it?”, I asked.</p><p>“I’m flexible”, he said.</p><p>Sandesh went on to explain how he discovered this flaw in strict routines and rituals, and therefore came up with weekly goals - do X task Y times this week. </p><p>For example - exercise 4 times this week, no matter which days and at which times. </p><p>It’s alright to miss 3 days in the week, it’s alright if he didn’t go every morning to the gym, he can go in the evening, he can skip that day. As long as he went 4 times a week (or even 3), he was good.</p><h2>Consistency with flexibility</h2><p>There were fireworks in my mind. Introduce flexibility into my rigid and consistent routine? </p><p>Flexibility and consistency are contrasting values, yet it was the simple and obvious solution to my problem.</p><p>Even though earlier I would be fine if I performed a habit 5 out of 7 times in a week, it was my mindset that needed a change.</p><p>Instead of seeing the 2 times I missed as a failure and being down about it, what if I accounted for failure in the routine? What if I embraced failure?</p><p>It was a simple change in mindset - from “perform a habit 5 times a week” to “you are allowed to fail upto 2 times a week”. </p><figure id="w-node-87a844fb7189-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f2639438357e7276aeaeb9e_Monthly%20Habit%20Tracker.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Have room for failure, so that when it does eventually happen, it doesn't set you back.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This is reflected in the <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/habit-tracker-app" target="_blank">habit tracker app</a> that I created, where there’s a column for ‘Goal’, ‘Achieved’ and a final column that says ‘Yay’ or ‘Nay’ if you crossed the goal. If the goal was to meditate 20 times a month, you get 10 chances to fail. </p><p>That eases off so much pressure from the mind and allows for serendipity to take over.</p><p>Consistency and flexibility are contrasting values. Yet combining them increases your chances of success, and helps you foster better mental health.</p><h2>Topics come organically</h2><p>Over a 2 hour conversation that often went too deep into philosophy (we couldn’t help it because it was so much fun) with Siddharth and Rahul who host The Indian Dream podcast, when the topic of keeping ourselves healthy during the times of Covid-19 came up, we talked about flexible consistency. </p><p>We talked about the importance of having a routine, yet being kind enough to ourselves to allow room for failure. These are tough times and nobody was prepared for this in advance.</p><p>I was reminiscing this conversation last night while talking to Mausumi, my girlfriend, thinking that I will skip writing anything this weekend and that it’s okay. </p><p>I went on to explain the concept of <a href="https://nesslabs.com/flexible-consistency" target="_blank">flexible consistency</a> to her, a phrase coined by Anne-Laure in her blog. I borrowed her phrase because it sounds and reads way cooler than how I used to describe it earlier - “Consistency with flexibility”. </p><p>That’s when it struck both of us at the same time.</p><p>I’d found my topic for the week.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

Isn’t it obvious that entities that have similar properties get clubbed together?<br></p><p>More than a decade later I realised that when they teach you something, maybe the entire topic is not as important as that one small nugget of information about this topic that might come in handy down the line.<br></p><p>For me, this nugget of information about Set theory was this.<br></p><figure id="w-node-9bd5380d78e6-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89ba9979e92b0e781ddd42_LfDXNcBl9XXlc_zSVncWIpmdoJD04pJhaLJimLGvE8O2j9cX6z2wpEYXfmE6XX3JwYbQ0JvFSOU7DOdSMxjhcI219Ksul3dSqhNYRhNfXipgHZAtf_IIXj6HMelTmUbhVbCIiu-7.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Most important aspect of a Set.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Why did this seemingly insignificant fact become the key to my mental sanity? And more importantly how did it help me prevent my codebase from turning into spaghetti? <strong>‍</strong></p><h3><strong>The problem</strong><br></h3><p>I am building a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">customer support tool</a> where the CS agent can solve customer queries raised from multiple channels of communication. <br></p><p>So by its very design we required a UI element which indicated how many conversations are left unattended for each of the channels.<br></p><figure id="w-node-27c4f9faeadc-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bae0425ec7344afac63a_YAjgaMGj963ZtjICveHP_c9Sgiyzrw1YyiN09vNE9ArwLj-jZRSRIIhjSkcS-3dXlERcyErMht4mKnJ-fbxuH1llqLC2NIn31zCsD0Nzheu4RWJ4sOIEykUZjjzQXEVj9_VvsQIL.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Open conversations in every support channel</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>As you may have guessed, this information is being retrieved on every refresh of the browser page and therefore running a count query through the conversation database for each support channel on every refresh is not very efficient. <br></p><p>Sure, it may not be a big deal at first but if we scale to even half of what we plan to hit with this product, a query like this will bite me in the rear sooner than I would want it to.<br></p><h3><strong>The obvious solution</strong><br></h3><p>The solution that occurred to me was to cache the count of open conversations for each support channel. This made sense at first but it quickly turned into a nightmare when I gave it a little more thought.<br></p><p>Okay so I plan to save a count of the open conversations in the cache, which means every time a conversation is opened I increment the count and every time a conversation is closed, I decrement the count? <br></p><p>Alright that doesn’t sound so bad but how do I trigger this increment/decrement operation? I suppose I could do it whenever a conversation gets updated in the database.</p><p><strong>And the problems begin</strong><br></p><p>But wait, I can’t trigger it every single time a conversation is updated, what if a conversation is open but some other data in the conversation gets updated while the status is still open? <br></p><p>Do I have to write an if-else condition to run the increment/decrement operation only when status changes from open to closed or from closed to open? <br></p><p>What happens if a conversation update finished running but the increment/decrement operation failed for some reason or vice versa? How do I re-run an update without corrupting the data?<br></p><p>In case you haven’t guessed where I was heading with this, here is a nice visual aid.<br></p><figure id="w-node-8acd9e28438e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bb0e233bae24f8426a98_4bpq9EhUO8t33FNJqWPsuFDUSKjgAkCndQBpK2Jp7vpODzh6eHAOGqskq5yJvkAE8LOMREF-CxlbpE-pvimw4nHMM-hR5H4s6nbxjxsx-X1mLFRykaGlaJqzQomxlq0IGL9dNF6j.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>This is not how a codebase should look</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The elegant solution</strong><br></h3><p>So how did Set theory get me out of this mess? What if I maintained a Set of IDs that belong to open conversations for each support channel? <br></p><p>All I have to do now is this: On every conversation update, if status is open, I add that conversation ID to the Set and I remove it from the Set if status is closed.<br></p><p>This Set would be stored on the RAM of course and yes it would take up more memory than storing just a single count for every support channel but all we are doing is storing IDs and not the entire data object so it would hardly cost much in terms of memory.<br></p><p>How does this help with the problem? Well, if you want the count of open conversations just get the number of elements in the Set, the cardinal number of the Set if you will. <br></p><p><strong>Why is this elegant? </strong></p><p>Because a Set cannot have duplicates. It does not matter how many times I add an item to a Set, a unique conversation ID can be added to it only once and similarly once a remove operation is performed, subsequent remove operations on the same conversation ID won’t have an affect on the data. The data has become idempotent.<br></p><p>This means that I don’t need an if-else condition when a conversation update operation is performed. All I need to do is perform an add/remove operation based on the status of the conversation post update. <br></p><p>It doesn’t matter if there is an explicit status update or not. Every update can trigger this logic and the data remains incorrupt. If any of the operations fail midway, the conversation update can just be re-run.<br></p><p>The code now looks like this</p><figure id="w-node-2d277519589a-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bb36be27e6c99c326654_oWQzIzHYO33Ha-W8vdEpTLGwdR7nKhkY8uILJGhi3ZAblDClNkJunvOEY924v0u7r1ifijiRdBMkLccDknHuDPcqlSCp3N2wcwP1-xCXIW_P4SzsERz1-WtEfa-2r1XA-QhL4vSW.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>This is how a codebase should look</figcaption></figure><h3>‍<br><strong>How to implement a Set data structure in your application</strong><br></h3><p>The most obvious way to do this is to use a JSON dictionary data structure like this for every support channel.</p><figure id="w-node-a0c1c2ac391e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bd048b9f4952f3ada401_s9ykghBfc4x32sr5cNPo-eOKI5lEI__XDz9HLD6WEGjw-EKesvHt8nc1wAV5JWX412TWIvLOMvE4oLB8xXrJMmQrdoAcoIxlozV1fWJpA0tQZU85OnJol_Mweheo2JKrLENl1aBM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A Set data structure using JSON</figcaption></figure><p>If a conversation needs to be added to the Set, update the dictionary with the key as the conversation id and value as true or 1.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Amazon provides the ability to create <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html">Billing Alarms</a> that can be used to alert whenever your AWS bill exceeds a certain threshold. However, this approach has a few shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to set a predefined threshold. When you are first starting to use AWS, it’s hard to know what your AWS bill will look like. A lot of people set this threshold pretty low to be safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alert like this tends to be reactive instead of proactive. The alarm gets triggered once the threshold has already crossed. For example, I had forgotten to turn off an EC2 instance I was no longer using but I only found out about a week later once my billing threshold crossed the limit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/">Cost Explorer</a> does provide an easy-to-use interface that can help keep you on top of your billing data. However, this requires one to use the tool regularly to ensure we don’t miss anything.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at how to build a simple pipeline to send us billing reports over email. The generated report will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-cost-alerts/billing-email.png" alt="billing-alert-email" title="Billing Alert Email"></p>
<p>The tools we will use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda</li>
<li>Simple Email Service</li>
<li>Cost Explorer API</li>
</ul>

<p>We will create a new folder called <code>app</code> which will store the application logic for the Cost Explorer API as well as using SES.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir </span>app
<span>touch </span>app/__init__.py app/cost_explorer.py app/email.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We will also create a file called <code>handler.py</code> in the root directory. This file will contain the logic used to generate billing reports.</p>

<h2 id="cost-explorer-api">Cost Explorer API</h2>
<p>We will be using the <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ce.html#CostExplorer.Client.get_cost_and_usage">Cost And Usage</a> endpoint from Cost Explorer to get the billing data we need.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4355502694485205147">
<p>A child refugee builds the first wholly female software company, putting feminism into practice, and goes on to become one of the most noted philanthropists in her country. It’s a story fit for Hollywood. Stephanie Shirley tells it with gusto, raw honesty, and compelling writing in her autobiography, <a href="https://amzn.to/3lV1A4C"><em>Let It Go</em></a>.</p>

<p>As a half-Jewish child during the beginning of World War 2, Shirley was saved from the horrors of Nazism by escaping on a train as a child refugee. In England she would build a new life, and build a software consulting company. Freelance Programmers (later F International) employed female programmers who were under-appreciated and discriminated against by the business world at the time. Many of these women worked from home part-time or while raising children in a world that wouldn’t allow them to work otherwise. They would work on large technical projects for some of the largest companies in Britain. <em>Let It Go</em> is a strong feminist treatise drawn from reality, not abstractions.</p>

<p>Shirley was a pioneer in many ways. Creating a software company in and of itself was still a new idea in 1962 when she got started. Creating a company of freelancers decades before “the gig economy” was an innovation. Employing almost all women in a technology company (although women were many of the first programmers) was unheard of. In <em>Let It Go</em> Shirley takes you through the early struggles of building Freelance Programmers. The reader receives a strong understanding of how the company operated, how it acquired clients, and the challenges that it faced as it grew from her cottage into a multi-million dollar enterprise. While Shirley covers the early period in the right level of detail, the company’s later growth is not as well recounted in the book.</p>

<p><em>Let It Go</em> is also a deeply personal book. Shirley goes into detail about her relationships, her family life, and her struggles taking care of her child, Giles, who is affected by a severe form of autism. She weaves the personal stories well into the business narrative, making it a more “full picture” story than most business books. Her personal life affected her business and vice versa. That’s true of almost anybody, and to think otherwise is a folly. Yet many business memoirs almost completely exclude personal details.</p>

<p>One of the things I appreciate most about <em>Let It Go</em> is that Shirley held nothing back. Even embarrassing or difficult details were not left out. If she felt jealousy or betrayal over a colleague’s actions, she explained it. She covered her mental breakdown. She covered marriage difficulties. She covered her fraught relationship with her parents. It was real. It was raw. And it made for a more realistic, interesting, and insightful journey.</p>

<p>The latter half of the book deals primarily with three topics: Shirley’s transformation of her company into a partially employee-owned operation, her struggles to help her son with his condition, and her philanthropy. Shirley ended up being a leading figure in philanthropy in Britain, and in autism philanthropy in particular. She founded a school for children with autism, the country’s largest autism charity, and too many other philanthropic initiatives to mention here. </p>

<p>The theme of the book can be seen as “relinquishing control,” hence the title <em>Let It Go</em>. Shirley ultimately let go of her personal tragedies, her business, and many of her philanthropic ventures (to other managers). And she sees them as more successful as a result of it. It’s a powerful message that can only be fully understood by reading the book. If you have any interest in the early software consulting business, the evolution of autism care, women working in technology, or just want to read a great life story, <em>Let It Go</em> is worth your time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>To make a good career, we start diving into lot of technical books since our early 20s. Some books we read over and over because either we fail to understand their content first few times or the concept itself is so intriguing that you want to refresh your memories with it every few years. For me, few of such books (among many others) are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">the dragon book on Compilers</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">the fat CLRS algorithms book</a>. Every time I read it, I understand some of the much more deeper concept that I failed to understand in my previous attempts. In my profession, I often face a situation where I need to go back and read about things that can be well explained in those books than searching on internet.</p>

<p>But, when it comes to reading the non-technical books, it is a different story. As a kid, I never read anything outside schoolbooks, except some comics in summer. Reading novels was not even remotely in my thought. It took me 23 years to take the first novel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code">Dan Brown’s Da Vinci Code</a> in my hand. The thriller novel was no doubt a very interesting book to read and I sat for hours reading it to complete. Over the period of years, I developed a hobby to read more books, however the book category that I got interested in turned out very different than my first non-technical book. I got interested in reading nonfiction books and here, I would like to describe some of my favorite ones I read so far.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gandhi-Autobiography-Story-Experiments-Truth/dp/0807059099" target="_blank"><img width="15%" height="15%" src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/books/gandhiji.jpg"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-my-experiments-with-truth">The Story of My Experiments with Truth</h3>

<p>An autobiography of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> by far is the best book I have ever read and most likely it will be my favorite in future. This book is part of curriculum (or at least it used to be) in many school districts of India to teach students the values and principles of one of the greatest spiritual soul that existed in the world. It might be hard to follow his principles for many of us, but I think there are many takeaways from this book that everyone can apply in their life and see benefit out of it. The book describes the childhood of Mohandas Gandhi, his personal struggle in controlling his thoughts as well as the freedom struggle that he led in South Africa and India to bring justice to the underprivileged. The book covers his life journey until 1921 after which he cites <strong><em>“My life from this point onward had been so public that there is hardly anything about it that people do not know”</em></strong>. I still recall one of the chapter in which he describes a very personal incident of him (and honestly I was astonished with the courage anyone would have to describe it in his/her autobiography) where he preferred his desire to spend some intimate time with his wife instead of massaging his old father who passes away while he was in bedroom. This incident led him to eventually practice abstinence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602774344&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank"><img width="15%" height="15%" src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/books/Steve_Jobs.jpg"></a></p>

<h3 id="steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</h3>

<p>If you want to know what it takes to be successful, or looking for something motivational, “Steve Jobs” is the book you should pick. Highly inspirational, this book starts with childhood days of Steve Jobs, how he was adopted, his schooling and drop out, his India tour and his love for computers which led in building the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">Apple I</a>. It describes incident where he was fired from Apple and how he took that opportunity to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar</a>, followed by his return to the Apple. The book teaches us how you need to envision and realize a bright future of technology industry. It teaches us the design principles and high expectation that Steve had, to deliver one of the finest and most polished products that were sold in any industry. 
Since the book is written after conducting more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs over two years, Walter Isaacson does a great job in capturing some of the dialogues of various instances between Steve and his colleagues with whom he built Mac, Pixar and iPhone.</p>

<h2 id="scientific">Scientific</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553380168/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2T69ZTGXT84LQ&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=brief+history+of+time+hawking&amp;qid=1602774364&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=brief+h%2Cstripbooks%2C234&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank"><img width="15%" height="15%" src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/books/BriefHistoryTime.jpg"></a></p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-time">A Brief History Of Time</h3>

<p>If you want to understand complex physics concepts in easy to understand language, “A Brief History of Time” is the book to read. Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking talks about basic concepts of space and time, building blocks of Universe, Time Travel, Black Holes, and the Big Bang theory in simple, non-technical terms. Once you read this book, it is fascinating to realize that you will understand all these things without seeing any physics equation. This short book of approximately 250 pages has only a single equation “E = mc<sup>2</sup>”. Major theories like “general relativity” and “quantum mechanics” are well explained that even a 7<sup>th</sup> grader can understand. A highly recommended book to brush up your physics concepts and can be completed over the weekend.</p>

<h3 id="the-geek-atlas">The Geek Atlas</h3>

<p>If you are a geek, and you want to know some of the coolest places in world that is unique in scientific way or where great discoveries were done, Geek Atlas is your traveler’s guide. It has 128 chapters, each talks about a place around the world where historically some great things related to science, mathematics or technology occurred. Even the number “128” that the author has chosen, is a power of 2, people from computer background are familiar with. Not just the book talks about a place, it also explains the scientific or technical concept behind that, so the reader can understand the importance of that place. By reading this book, not only does the reader acquire knowledge about these 128 places, but also understand 128 concepts that you must have not known or might have long forgotten. From Darwin’s Theory of Evolution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Campus">1 Infinite Loop</a>, this book has a great collection of topics to read. My favorite among all of those is a place <strong><em>Le Pantheon</em></strong> in Paris having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum">Foucault pendulum</a> that demonstrates the Earth’s rotation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/0544272994/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=what+if+xkcd&amp;qid=1602774404&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><img width="15%" height="15%" src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/books/What_If_xkcd.jpg"></a></p>

<h3 id="what-if">What If?</h3>

<p>From the author of <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd webcomic</a>, “What If?” is a fun book to read that gives great scientific answers to the non-sensible hypothetical questions. The book contains some of the selected answers from his webcomic <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/">what-if.xkcd</a>. It is very astonishing to see author’s knowledge on physics and mechanics concept when you see him giving scientific explanation to some of the imaginary question. For example, <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/13/">Laser Pointer chapter</a> answers <strong><em>“If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?”</em></strong> As factitious it sounds, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randall Munroe</a> starts by explaining where should be the Moon relative to Earth to get maximum exposure of laser light, choosing a place on Earth where maximum people can point their laser beam on and at what time they should be doing that. He further explains what lumens of light a laser should have and its effect on moon and how much power it would take if stronger focus lights are used instead of laser beam. The answer also talks about the possibility of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility">National Ignition Facility</a> that has the confinement beam of most powerful laser on the Earth. Further, he gives some equation that explains if the light beams will vaporize the Moon rocks. To help easy understand and imagine, these answers and the surrounding explanation are depicted by various drawings.</p>

<p>If you want to test how much you know about something, try explaining it to a 5-year old. If you can translate the complex concepts in a simple term that child can understand, you probably know the concept well. That is the theme that Randall Munroe, the author of “What If?”, followed in “Thing Explainer” as well. Randall uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English">1000 most common English words</a> to explain how some of the things around us works. He explains Microwave, Data centers, International Space Station, Solar System, Helicopters, Washers and Dryers and Human organs. Not to mention, all these concepts are demonstrated by giant drawings.</p>

<p>I got fascinated about history after watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ek_Khoj">Bharat Ek Khoj</a>, an Indian TV series based on Jawaharlal Nehru’s “The Discovery of India”. Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India written this book while in imprisonment by British during India’s freedom struggle. The book starts by describing Indus Valley Civilization, which one of the oldest civilizations, existed between 3300 BCE and 1900 BCE. As the civilization matured, the book takes you through the arrival of Vedic people, caste formation, ages during which the longest epic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">“Mahabharata”</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">“Ramayana”</a> was written, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/ancient-medieval/early-indian-empires/a/buddhism-in-indian-culture">arrival of Buddhism</a>, various ages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya">Mauryas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangam_period">Sangam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha">Vardhana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola_dynasty">Chola</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire">Maratha</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughal</a> and finally British. It describes how the kings and rulers of each dynasty influenced the Indian culture and traditions, its territory and their economy model all of which can be seen deeply embedded in 21<sup>st</sup> century’s India.</p>

<h3 id="freedom-at-midnight">Freedom at Midnight</h3>

<p>Freedom at Midnight is the latest historical book I read. Written by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, this is one of the most fascinating and marvelous book of events around Indian independence and its partition. The authors took couple of years of intense research with lot of interviews to capture every minute details of India between 1946 and 1948. The book starts when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a> is appointed as the last viceroy of India in the Winter of 1946. His task is to withdraw the British rule from a land that they ruled for more than 150 years. The challenge that came with the task was to convince the Indian leaders to avoid partitioning the country. He succeeded in the former, but unfortunately failed in later. The book also describes similar attempts of another Indian leader, Mahatma Gandhi, who tried hard to avoid partition, but failed miserably. The book narrates the colorful and lavish lifestyles enjoyed by Indian kings and princes, the circumstances that led to the decision of partition, its repercussion of bloodshed. The book concludes with a chapter “The second crucifixion” that describes the murder of Mahatma Gandhi, the great soul.</p>

<h4 id="advertencia">Advertencia</h4>
<p><strong>El kernel que viene con las distribuciones es suficiente para la mayoría de los casos. Usar un kernel compilado a mano puede dejar el sistema inusable sino se realiza correctamente. No debería usarse en sistemas en producción salvo que se sepa exactamente qué, por qué y para qué se hace. Hay distribuciones que limitan o no proveen el soporte en sistemas Linux con kernels compilados a mano. Siempre es recomendable hacer un backup tanto del directorio /boot como del directorio /lib/modules.</strong></p>
<h4 id="motivacion">Motivación</h4>
<p>Si no has leído la <strong>Advertencia</strong> por favor no sigas. Leela detenidamente y seguimos.
¿Ya está? ¡OK! ¿Por qué compilar un kernel hoy en 2020? Un razón es que al compilar se puede aprender que funcionalidades proporciona el kernel, deshabilitar funciones que <em>sabemos</em> no vamos a usar, probar nuevas características ausentes en la versión del kernel de la distribución y también para entender más cómo trabaja el sistema operativo. Este <em>how-to</em> ha sido probado tanto en Debian 10 como en CentOS 8. En una máquina con 2GB y un único procesador llevaría menos de una hora hacerlo (obviamente cuantos más sean los módulos o componentes agregados más va a tardar). Recordar que se puede compilar como un ususuario común y luego pedir privilegios de root para instalar. 
Basta de palabras y manos a la obra. </p>

<h3>Are Elections Actually Random?</h3>

<p>A popular narrative explaining the outcome of the 2016 election is that the odds were in Clinton’s favor.
She just got unlucky.
That election night, dice were cast, and she unfortunately rolled snake eyes.
The comforting messages implied by this interpretation probably explains it’s popularity;
it was nobody’s fault,
we still have the popular ideas,
we don’t even have to change our strategy to win next time.
The alternatives are much harder to look at.
But, the critical, yet unquestioned assumption that this narrative
depends on is that elections are random events.
But how similar is winning election to winning roulette?</p>

<p>Let’s briefly relate what actually happens on voting day.
People wake up in the morning and make a decision whether to make their way to vote or not.
They physically walk or drive to a voting location, and then choose who’s name to record, either by pushing a button or writing it in.
Later, the votes are tallied and grouped by region and a winner is announced.</p>

<p>Where is the randomness?
It’s hard to even find where variables might be changing rapidly.
The media framework and campaign context is a product of months of effort.
Each individuals broad political views are slow moving.
They are driven by countless deeply rooted influences such as family upbringing, income, ethnicity, religion, education, culture.
Undoubtedly all of this is very complex, much if it is unconscious and affected by PR and marketing,
 but nowhere do we see anything that looks like a random occurrence.
It’s always cause and effect, and it’s not all that mysterious as you can probably make a good guess of how
an acquaintance will vote.</p>

<p>You might argue this isn’t what is really meant when “chance” is talked about in elections.
Journalists aren’t implying they function like a lottery.
The percentages they throw around are confidence intervals.
Pollsters can’t talk to everyone in the country, so they talk to a
sample, and then use probability to guess how likely it is that
this sample represents the whole population.
It’s basic statistics.</p>

<p>But, even if the numbers come from such methods,
this is not how they are presented by journalists and
otherwise intelligent and “scientific” people don’t understand them that way either.
If so, they would be much more concerned about finding specific gaps between the sample and population
instead of wondering what the odds look like on their bet.
Just look at how prevelant the random model is in these examples:</p>

<p><strong>Election as a Pachinko Machine (1)</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/questioning-probability/pachinko.png" alt="pachinko machine"></p>

<p>Let’s hope the people making these promotions
aren’t the same as those making the models.</p>

<p><strong>Election as an Unlucky Dice Roll</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/questioning-probability/random_roll.png" alt="random roll"></p>

<p>Unlucky again?</p>

<p><strong>A Small Probability is still a Possibility</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/questioning-probability/math.png" alt="math"></p>

<p>Perhaps students need fewer stats classes and more critical thinking.</p>

<h3>Our Cultural of Randomness</h3>

<p>Questionable applications of random thinking aren’t confined to politics.
This reflects an underlying cultural trust and belief in the power of statistics.
At first glance it appear to fit with our love of science and intelligence.
Just look at all the numbers, equations, and graph.
Everyone knows smart people use data to make decisions and
it overcomes biases.
Didn’t you watch Money Ball?</p>

<p>But this belief actually begins with our our basic physical view;
the world is atoms crashing into each other in the void,
and at the atomic level quantum events are happening which we don’t understand.
Fundamentally, the  future is indefinite, uncertain, and hazy.
We can’t really plan or predict it.
Sometimes we can setup Fleming or Darwinian-like projects to tip chance
in our favor,
but the best thing to do is leave all your options open to respond to unforeseen conditions.
This indefinite attitude permeates our world with “lean startups”,
index funds, zero interest, zero savings, extracurricular, and no planning. (2)</p>

<p>But let’s examine this views underyling underlying premise.
How many things in our world are actually random?
If you believe basic physics, it doesn’t appear anything at the scale of everyday life is really random.
Every physical action is driven by cause and effect, which can be described
at the human scale can be accurately using deterministic Newtonian relationships.</p>

<p>In computer programs it’s not even possible to obtain data which is truly random.
Usually it’s just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">function</a> which is hard to predict, and uses varying
inputs like time of data.
Better sources sample from physical motion, like air vibrations.
When random functions aren’t random enough,
hackers can break <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator_attack">encryption</a>.</p>

<p>Just like the 2016 election, it doesn’t take scrutiny to realize that most subjects of statistical study
are not actually driven by chance.</p>

<h3>When is Probability Useful?</h3>

<p>That is not to suggest that the entire field is misguided.
Probability itself is a sound mathematical model, central
to scientific inquiry.
But, if the required axiom of having a random variable
is virtually always false, then why should we ever hope to apply it
in the real world?</p>

<p>We have already talked about one use case.
Reasoning about a population from a sample.
Ignoring the missing principle of uniformity in nature, and whether
distributions are correct, this is still a helpful way to study
large groups.</p>

<p>Another use case is when there are just too many variables to understand.
When we have a cause and effect theory, but too many input variables,
it’s overwhelming to use, so we settle for partial information.
Consider a dice roll.
Through classical mechanics we can understand gravity, the force of the throw, the friction in the air,
the impact on the table,
and with all this make an accurate description of the outcome.
But no human can capture all those parameters in a split second and apply them.
Without a controlled environment for study probability is a good model.</p>

<p>However, statistical physical models don’t just making random assignments.
They tightly constrain the probability with deterministic mathematics,
such as using regular formulas for area and force. (3)
Furthermore, they never imply an underlying law of randomness.
Rather they are useful compromises with tolerable inaccuracies.</p>

<p>The most common use case for statistics,
and the one that needs to be scrutinized the most,
is when you don’t really
understand cause and effect relationships.
Without a workable theory of nature, stats act as an adhoc placeholder.
Data gets mapped to distributions, and patterns get correlated,
without considering how the underlying objects works.</p>

<p>When this is your only option, it’s probably better than nothing.
But, you have to be honest about the limitations.
You definitely shouldn’t be surprised to find “black swans”
when all you did is plot a bell curve,
and hope everything else follows uniformly.</p>

<p>Consider two fields almost synonymous with stats; economics and psychology.
Does anyone have a clear picture of how markets function,
or the causes of inflation?
Can anyone give an account of why people think and believe what they do?
Of course not, and the popular theories change rapidly and dramatically.
There are are a lot of variables in these domains
too, so perhaps probability models are unavoidable.
But clearly they are lacking in explanatory theories.
Maybe a scientific theory isn’t even possible.</p>

<h3>A Universal Way of Understanding</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html">The Republic X</a>, Plato observes a related attitude in painting and poetry.
He describes their practice as giving an appearance of understanding through shallow, and quickly made presentations:</p>

<blockquote><p>The imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part an image.
For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter.</p>

<p> And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows […] I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.</p>

<p>And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, who is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as well as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them</p></blockquote>

<p>Statistics students and professionals hold the same remarkable belief about their own field today.
They don’t need to study any subject or “applications”, besides statistics itself.
Their statistical knowledge is immediately transferable to
understanding any problem thrown their way, whether in tech, business, politics, finance, or healthcare.
It’s a universal framework for understanding.
This makes it the perfect career in the culture of randomness, and ironically
minimize the need to make predictions about the future.</p>

<p>But can you understand business without running one?
Can you understand voting patterns without understanding what
is happening in people’s lives?
Can you understand psychology without thinking, observing, and talking to people?
Lack of basic knowledge and experience leave a lot to be desired.
In these areas, as in politics, we can conclude that probability and statistics are poor substitutes
for explanatory theory.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>(1) Pachinko might be a good model to predict whether an INDIVIDUAL voter will make it to the voting
location, as intended. Each peg represents an event encouraging or discouraging them (medical emergencies, flat tires, relationship …</p></div>

<p><a href="https://scryptdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/logo.png"><img alt="sCrypt logo" src="https://scryptdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/logo.png"></a></p><p>sCrypt (pronounced “ess crypt”) is a high-level smart contract language for Bitcoin SV.
Bitcoin supports smart contract with its Forth-like stack based Script language.
However writing smart contract in native Script is cumbersome and error-prone.
It quickly becomes intractable when the contract size and complexity grow.</p>
<p>sCrypt is designed to facilitate writing smart contract running on chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to learn. Syntactically, sCrypt is similar to Solidity, making it easier to be adopted by existing smart contract developers. However, the resemblance is only superficial, since sCrypt is compiled into Bitcoin Script by the underlying compiler, instead of EVM bytecode.</li>
<li>It is statically typed. Type checking can help detect many errors at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>sCrypt is still in experimental phase and is currently only intended for small amount usage.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the past few years, every company I interact with doesn't get the same email address from me. I'm trying to be as plain as possible with this post, but we're going to go on a bit of adventure. So what I'm really trying to say here is, “You should be doing this too and your privacy is important.”</p>

<p>The rest of this article is why it matters to you, but most importantly, what you do matters for everyone.</p>

<p>An email address identifies you on the internet. It's how your friends send you chain letters. It's how companies send you receipts and track your purchasing habits. Out of all the billions of people online, it's how anyone or anything identifies you and can get in touch.</p>

<p>Now, if that's all an email address is really used for, it's probably fine to just have the one. But that's not all that your email is used for. I'd like you to take a journey of the imagination with me for a little bit.</p>

<p>You don't need to close your eyes, but really try to picture this in your mind. Or maybe even grab some pen and paper and draw this out, especially if you've got aphantasia.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="building-a-mind-map">Building a Mind Map</h2>

<p>In the middle of this page, mental or otherwise, scrawl your email address. Then write a company that knows your email address. Draw a line from your email address to the company. Repeat this again for a second company.</p>

<p>Right now, you should have two companies each with a line connecting to your email address. Imagine for a second that those two companies wanted to work together through a partnership. Each one has your email address and all of the information they've gleaned from you using their service, whatever that might be.</p>

<p>Draw a line between the two companies. You can't know for sure, but the worst case scenario is they both share all the information they have about you with each other.</p>

<p>Let's lean into this worst case scenario. Keep adding companies that know your email address. Draw a line between every company, make sure they're all connected. Again, you can't know for sure, but do you know they're not talking about you?</p>

<p>Looking at this graph, what could be known about your life?</p>

<p><em>Where you live, what you buy, who you talk to, what you like, what you don't like, what you eat, what you drink, your religious and political affiliations.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="implications-of-knowledge-sharing-without-your-consent">Implications of knowledge sharing without your consent</h2>

<p>If you haven't heard about Cambridge Analytica before, now would be a great time to look them up. This is an example of when just one company collaborates with another company that has access to all of your personal information.</p>

<p>In this case, it's Facebook pimping out your private information to a company that runs targeted digital advertising campaigns. I'm sure you've heard about the electoral college before. And you know some states are really entrenched with a certain political affiliation.</p>

<p>Other states though, are swing states. These are what make and break an election campaign. Campaigns are extremely expensive to run, so it makes sense to prioritize the budget into areas that make the most impact.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica specializes in identifying swing voters in swing states, profiles them accordingly and then runs targeted advertising campaigns. They whisper in your ear whatever you need to hear to convince you to vote for their candidate.</p>

<h2 id="cambridge-analytica-and-me">Cambridge Analytica and Me</h2>

<p>If you've been following this blog, you know that I quit Facebook cold turkey a few months ago. I always knew I would, but the reason it was finally the right time was surprisingly simple.</p>

<p>I was trying to start a dialog and to break out of the algorithm. Everyone I'm friends with on Facebook, I can guarantee is a real person. I never made internet friends on that platform.</p>

<p>I knew in the run up to the 2016 election that tensions were high. I was working in Silicon Valley and graduated from Liberty University. I tried  to create <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary" rel="nofollow">a Facebook app to allow for a third-party primary</a> where I'd calculate the likelihood you were a <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary/blob/master/lib/person/real.js" rel="nofollow">real person</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary/blob/master/lib/person/eligible.js" rel="nofollow">eligible to vote in America</a>, based on <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary/blob/master/lib/fb_parser.js" rel="nofollow">your facebook information</a>.</p>

<p>The gist was, both candidates were so bad, I believed we could finally elect a third party candidate and break the stranglehold of the two-party system in America. A vast majority of people I talked to conceded both candidates were bad and they were voting for what they believed to be, “the lesser of two evils.”</p>

<p>In my mind, all we needed to do is have a third-party primary where we all commit to vote for the candidate that wins. I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting" rel="nofollow">Instant-Runoff Voting</a> to mitigate the need for voters to hedge their bets on a lesser evil and instead rank candidates by their actual preference.</p>

<p>I couldn't get this app approved because Facebook had become a lot more stringent on their app usage guidelines. I won't speculate much, but I do believe ongoing Cambridge Analytica events and their relationship to Facebook are worth noting here.</p>

<p>Long story short, I'm trying to say, I know a bit about the practical capabilities of the information Facebook has at their disposal and the technical know-how to use it to build applications.</p>

<p>So why did I quit Facebook and why only a few months ago and what does this have to do with it?</p>

<h2 id="algorithmic-consequences">Algorithmic Consequences</h2>

<p>Because I know my friends on Facebook and my friends know me, even though we disagree, I've never stooped down to childish levels to get my point across. We might not see eye to eye, but there's a mutual respect that is rare these days and must be cherished.</p>

<p>So my simple answer is, I quit Facebook because of Tim.</p>

<p>That came out wrong, so I guess we do need a more complex answer.</p>

<p>Tim and I both attended Liberty University, he was my prayer leader the first semester on campus. I know Tim is a good-hearted dude, we've had many deep and spiritual conversations, even though our lives only intersected briefly.</p>

<p>When I was seeking to break out of the algorithm, I was actually looking for Tim. Well, someone like Tim, it didn't need to be Tim. We'll probably need to know Tim's perspective, but my hypothesis is that I had not been on his timeline in years until reaching across the algorithm.</p>

<p>This was a bit intentional on my part. You see, years earlier, I watched as an old high school friend, Josh, was eaten by Facebook's algorithm. At one point in time, Facebook used to show all your friends posts in chronological order.</p>

<p>It was really cool because you knew when your friends were bored. They'd be posting a lot and you were bored too, so you'd message them and be like, “hey, let's hang out.” But then the timeline changed to be controlled by an algorithm.</p>

<p>I gamed this for a little while and became low-key addicted to Facebook popularity. If you could get some likes quickly, you'd show up on more timelines and get more likes. I was quickly able to discover what was entertaining to my Facebook friends and would milk them for a little bit of dopamine on my end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was watching Josh fade away. We were never super close, but I respected his authenticity. That dude posted about his life and it was depressing, but it was real. I watched as his posts trickled from ~20 likes, to 10, to 5, to 2, to maybe if he was lucky, he'd get a single like.</p>

<p>The only difference was the algorithm change. The exposure of his posts to his friends decreased because Facebook deemed his content less important than content people were engaging with, like mine. I was pegging 50 to 100 likes around then. I mean, I'm not a thirst trap, but that was pretty good if you adjust for social inflation.</p>

<p>With this, my research into social media algorithms was complete. It's really that simple, you are either are popular enough to be seen or you're essentially shadow-banned.</p>

<p>In protest of this and in solidarity with Josh, I chose to post less on Facebook. It's pretty bogus for Facebook to have this level of control on what we see or we don't see.</p>

<p>So that's the point I'm getting at here with Tim. In our discourse, Tim said something like, “I don't see what you're seeing, help me see what you're seeing.”  I know Tim meant that, I know we're not seeing the same stuff because Facebook is feeding us both different content to keep us engaged with the platform longer so they can get more money.</p>

<p>Tim, what I'm seeing is Facebook controlling the worldview of our friends and family. It might be free as in free beer, but it's not free as in freedom. Hollywood can point a camera at just the right angle and make films that look and feel authentic, but they are fake and hollow facades.</p>

<p>The difference between Hollywood and Facebook is that you know you're in for a night of fiction and fun when you buy a movie ticket.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="reeling-it-in">Reeling it in</h2>

<p>That was a longer tangent than anticipated, so let's get back to your email record-linkage mind-map. That detour we took through Facebook is the example of just one company exploiting your private information for personal gain.</p>

<p>Looking at your map, I'm sure you see some companies on there you trust whole heartedly. If you do, I hope you pay those companies money, because it's only a matter of time before they'll need to sell you out to make ends meet. Benevolent dictators are only benevolent if they live short enough to never become just dictators.</p>

<p>But hey, let's be realistic, not all companies will sell your personal information. It's a little conspiratorial and genuinely unproductive to jump to that type of  conclusion prematurely. All of my Facebook ramblings here have also been anecdotal at best.</p>

<p>Without concrete facts, I'd be no better than QAnon or any of the other bullshit you'll find on social media to hold your attention.</p>

<h3 id="getting-real">Getting Real</h3>

<p><a href="https://codingwithsomeguy.com/shows/powerhackers/e5-tyler/" rel="nofollow">Last week I did an interview with my friend Guy</a>. He runs a twitch stream and is one of the most legitimately cool people I've ever met.

<p>I made a lot of great friends at Inflection and worked with some amazingly talented people there. So I just want to clarify upfront, that sigh and that …</p></div></div>

I originally conceived of arms made of two vertical 4mm pieces with cross braces, but fortunately Gab asked ‘why not just make it a single 10mm piece?’ Duh.</p><p>The Thicc motor layout flies great so we’re starting with that. We know the front of the lens has to be approximately in line with the front motors for unobstructed video. With the battery behind the cam, this works out almost perfectly for CG. The Z Cam has side mounting holes, which are great for changing cam tilt. This also means the cam plate can be parallel with the top plate, which will make experimenting with dampers much easier. This also gives us a simple blank canvas for the cam plate so we can accommodate different cameras. With those parameters established it was time to get crackin’.</p><p>A 20mm stack was enough for the components in Thicc, so I made the arms 20mm tall. The sandwich plates will be 3mm – I couldn’t imagine anything thinner being strong enough. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592667903129_11444"><div>

We might need m3 screw holes, we might need great big grommet holes. Meanwhile, the carbon came in. It’s a bit nerve wracking to cut interlocking parts since tolerances are so critical. Too tight and you’ll be filing, too loose and things are floppy.

    <p><time datetime="2020-10-17T00:00:00+02:00">Sat Oct 17, 2020</time> by Caspar</p>

<p>Today at around 10:45pm CET, after a couple of glasses of red wine, we deleted the production database by accident 😨. Over 300.00 scoreboards and their associated data were vaporised in an instant.</p>

<p>Thankfully our database is a managed database from DigitalOcean, which means that DigitalOcean automatically do backups once a day. After 5 minutes of hand-wringing and panic, we took the website into maintenance mode and worked on restoring a backup. At around 11:15pm CET, 30 minutes after the disaster, we went back online, however 7 hours of scoreboard data was gone forever 😵.</p>

<p>To be precise, any scoreboards created or scores added on the 17th October 2020 between 15:47 CET and 23:21 CET have been lost. We are extremely sorry about this.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/disaster.jpg" alt="Blue green tennis"></p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>

<p>It’s tempting to blame the disaster on the couple of glasses of red wine. However, the function that wiped the database was written whilst sober. It’s a function that deletes the local database and creates all the required tables from scratch. This evening, whilst doing some late evening coding, the function connected to the production database and wiped it. Why? This is something we’re still trying to figure out.</p>

<p>Here is the code that caused the disaster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>database_model_create</span>():
    <span>"""Only works on localhost to prevent catastrophe"""</span>
    database <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_DATABASE
    user <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_USERNAME
    password <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_PASSWORD
    port <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_PORT
    local_db <span>=</span> PostgresqlDatabase(database<span>=</span>database, user<span>=</span>user, password<span>=</span>password, host<span>=</span><span>'localhost'</span>, port<span>=</span>port)
    local_db<span>.</span>drop_tables([Game, Player, Round, Score, Order])
    local_db<span>.</span>create_tables([Game, Player, Round, Score, Order])
    <span>print</span>(<span>'Initialized the local database.'</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>host</code> is hardcoded to <code>localhost</code>. This means it should <strong>never connect to any machine other than the developer machine</strong>.  Also: <strong>of course</strong> we use different passwords and users for development and production. We’re too tired to figure it out right now.</p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-learned-why-won-t-this-happen-again">What have we learned? Why won’t this happen again?</h2>

<p>We’ve learned that having a function that deletes your database is too dangerous to have lying around. The problem is, you can never really test the safety mechanisms properly, because testing it would mean pointing a gun at the production database.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that having a backup which allows a quick recovery is absolutely essential. Thanks DigitalOcean, for making this part reliable and simple.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that even a disaster can have some up-sides. This blog post generated a lot of interest. When life gives you citrus fruits, and so on.</p>

<p>The truth is, we can never be 100% sure that something like this won’t happen again. Computers are just too complex and there are days when the complexity gremlins win. However, we will figure out what went wrong and ensure that this <em>particular</em> error doesn’t happen again.</p>

<h2 id="some-perspective">Some perspective</h2>

<p>Thankfully nobody’s job is at risk due to this disaster. The founder is not going to fire the developer – because they are one and the same person.</p>

<p>Also, this webapp is just a side-project. It’s not the software that’s running a power-plant. Nonetheless, we have many users, some of them paying customers, and we try our very best to make them happy. Today we let those users down and that hurts.</p>

<p>The wonderful irony is that not 4 days earlier we tweeted a <em>hilarious</em> meme about deleting your production database:
</p><blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/mOlFqWal08">pic.twitter.com/mOlFqWal08</a></p>— Keepthescore.co (@keep_the_score) <a href="https://twitter.com/keep_the_score/status/1315552102299598851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2020</a></blockquote>



<p>Again, we are very sorry. Good night.</p>

<p>As you may know, I am a published author. Three books to date, <a href="https://justworldfallacy.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://justworldfallacy.com/">still working on that fourth</a>.</p>



<p>Every so often, somebody contacts me with the goal of getting me to pay them to do some useless service. </p>



<p>This is an old scam which appeals to every author’s vanity. But I’ve seen it enough times I don’t fall for it. Any more. (That’s another story…)</p>



<p>Recently, I was pitched by a company that makes really bad pitch videos supposedly headed towards Netflix. Here is our exchange:</p>



<p>On September 10th, I received the following unsolicited email:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="608" src="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-1024x608.jpg" alt="Invitation to submit your book to Netflix" srcset="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-300x178.jpg 300w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-768x456.jpg 768w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001.jpg 1097w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-300x178.jpg 300w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-768x456.jpg 768w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001.jpg 1097w" data-lazy-src="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-001-1024x608.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Invitation to submit your book to Netflix</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I responded: “Which book? I’ve written three and am working on a fourth.”</p>



<p>To which, Jossie responded: “I have here the book entitled “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Rebuilding-Fly-Brian-Doomed-Disappointment-ebook/dp/B00KUQHWM8/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=rebuilding+on+the+fly&amp;qid=1601326711&amp;sr=8-1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amazon.ca/Rebuilding-Fly-Brian-Doomed-Disappointment-ebook/dp/B00KUQHWM8/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=rebuilding+on+the+fly&amp;qid=1601326711&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Rebuilding on the Fly: How Brian Burke Doomed the Leafs to More Disappointment</a>” and “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Beatles-Greatest-Rock-Band-Prove-ebook/dp/B00KUPGLJ4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+beatles+are+the+greatest+band+of+all+time+and+i+can+prove+it&amp;qid=1601326771&amp;sr=8-1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amazon.ca/Beatles-Greatest-Rock-Band-Prove-ebook/dp/B00KUPGLJ4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+beatles+are+the+greatest+band+of+all+time+and+i+can+prove+it&amp;qid=1601326771&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Beatles are the Greatest Rock Band of All Time and I can Prove it</a>”.&nbsp; Jossie” [I added those links to promote my books.]</p>



<p>I responded sarcastically: “Both of those might be Netflix TV series? Wow!”</p>



<p>Keep in mind, I have only ever published non-fiction books. Also, they are not the kinds of books that could be adapted into TV shows.</p>



<p>This elicited a long response:</p>

<p>It goes into detail:</p>

<p>This is the point at which anyone unfamiliar with the scam should run away. I really hope that, if you are a struggling author, and someone offers to provide you unsolicited services for you at exorbitant prices, you run away.</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: “Is that in USD?”</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: “Yes, that is in USD.&nbsp; Jossie”</p>



<p>At this point, I posted about this on Facebook and got some assistance with how to continue the conversation. My friends suggested a few strategies to waste Jossie’s time.</p>



<p>To start, I wrote the following:</p>



<blockquote><p>Great.</p><p>So, I want to get started, but I have a few concerns.</p><p>The first concern is about the pandemic. What kind of precautions are in place to film safely? Will I be in the same space as the actors?</p><p>Thanks!</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: You do not have to worry about the pandemic.&nbsp; Our production team will take charge of that.&nbsp; Can we process your payment today so that we can jumpstart with the project?&nbsp; Let me know the best number to reach you.&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: But I do have to worry about the pandemic. Can you at least assure me that I will not be in the room with others through this process, and that anyone who has to be indoors will be wearing a mask until they absolutely can’t?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: I can assure you 100% you will be safe because it will be your publicist who will be representing your from the start of the process until the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Glad to hear it. Who are we looking at to have in the pitch video? We need someone with gravitas, regardless of which book we’re going with.</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: I will take note of your suggestion and inform production on what you want.&nbsp; Anyway, when they are done with the video, we will present that to you for your approval before we will submit that to the acquisition team of Netflix.&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: And will I get revisions?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: Absolutely!</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Great. One other important matter: who’s on your Board?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: Can we talk over the phone so that I can answer all your questions?</p>



<p>As you can imagine, I did not want to give out my phone number to this person. I could give them a fake one but then it would be over.</p>



<p>But the funny thing is that it is very easy to find my phone number online. So if they had just searched for a few minutes…</p>



<p>Anyway, it continues:</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: I need to know who I’m dealing with. This is important to me if I’m going to trust you.</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: I completely understand.&nbsp; Our Board members are Brandon Peters, Feb Petterson, Michael Brown, Tom Aspen and Alex Jordan.</p>



<p>Google them. I did.</p>



<ul><li>Brandon Peters is a “Sr. Marketing Consultant”</li><li>Feb Petterson doesn’t seem to exist</li><li>Nor does Michael Brown</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bookwhip.com/book-reseller-authors-testimonials" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bookwhip.com/book-reseller-authors-testimonials" target="_blank">Tom Aspen is mentioned in one of their very fake looking testimonials</a></li><li>And then there’s Alex Jordan (more on them in a moment)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Are they all men?!? I can’t find their pictures online but three of them seem like men for sure.</p>



<p>There was no immediate response so I send another email:</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: I don’t think I can can work with a company that doesn’t have any female representation on the board.</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: Alex Jordan is a woman.</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Excellent! Do you have her bio? This is very good news. I want to work with progressive organizations.</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: I will be sending it shortly.&nbsp; I have to ask permission first.</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Oh of course. I’m ready to go. Just one last thing: can I see a sample video? Are there any that previous clients have allowed you to share with future clients like me? Thanks! You’ve been so helpful.</p>



<p>First, I got the bio:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="629" src="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-1024x629.jpg" alt="Alex Jordan bio" srcset="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-1024x629.jpg 1024w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-300x184.jpg 300w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-768x472.jpg 768w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005.jpg 1083w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-1024x629.jpg 1024w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-300x184.jpg 300w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-768x472.jpg 768w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005.jpg 1083w" data-lazy-src="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-005-1024x629.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Alex Jordan’s bio, if that is her real name</figcaption></figure>



<p>No sign of her on the internet, which is weird because she is an author and supposedly the founder of an extant business. Anyway…</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Thank you! Sounds accomplished</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: You are welcome!&nbsp; Let me know when you are ready.&nbsp; I am excited to work with you and jumpstart with the project.</p>



<p>And then, Jossie sent me the sample video.</p>



<p>Are you ready for it?</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: So how did this go over?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: It is now on negotiation process with the acquisition team of Netflix and the author.&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Wow, that’s incredible.</p>



<p>It’s really incredible. Hard to believe, almost.</p>



<p>Then, later that day, I got a new email:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="228" src="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-1024x228.jpg" alt="endorsement to Netflix" srcset="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-1024x228.jpg 1024w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-300x67.jpg 300w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-768x171.jpg 768w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006.jpg 1091w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-1024x228.jpg 1024w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-300x67.jpg 300w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-768x171.jpg 768w, https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006.jpg 1091w" data-lazy-src="https://rileyhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bookwhip-006-1024x228.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>endorsement to Netflix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Ooh, I like the sound of jump starting it. What do we do next?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: Can we process your payment today so that we can start with the project.&nbsp; Please give me the best number to call you today so that I can forward you &nbsp;to our Finance Department.&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p>Now, I have worked for companies which deal with old people. and if there’s one thing old people misunderstand about modern technology, it’s that they think email is more secure than the phone. (It’s not.) So I decided to have fun with that.</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: I pay over the phone?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: Yes, Finance will be getting your card details.&nbsp; I will forward you to them.&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: My card details?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: yes</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: What kind of card?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: You can use any credit or debit card…Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: I don’t know if I’m comfortable giving that information over the phone. You don’t have a secure payment system?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: We have other options.&nbsp; Can we talk over the phone?&nbsp; Please send me the best number to reach you.</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: What are you going to tell me over the phone that you can’t tell me by email?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: Our Finance Team will be the one talking to you and discuss to you some option.&nbsp; They wanted to talk to you over the phone for verification purposes too.&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: Verification of what?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: I do not know exactly what they will be asking you.&nbsp; It is between you and the Finance Team for confidentiality.&nbsp; Jossie</p>



<p><strong>Riley</strong>: And they can only speak to me by phone?</p>



<p><strong>Jossie</strong>: Yes, that is right.</p>



<hr>



<p>At this point, I had to attend to some family issues where I would be without internet, so I let it drop. It was 6 days since they first emailed me, which seems like a good waste of their time.</p>



<p>But here’s what I know:</p>



<p>Bookwhip.com has privacy protection from a Canadian registrar (Tucows). But the website says “In partnership with JRZ Outsourcing Services and Pearson Media Groups.”</p>



<p><strong>JRZ Outsourcing Services</strong> is based in Mississauga, Delaware and the Philippines, according to their website. (Delaware is a US state with a lot of shell corporations, FYI.) Their website is with GoDaddy and also has privacy protection.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I work from home, and have used a pedal-powered generator to power my office since 2010  (You can learn why <a href="https://www.pedalpc.com/about">here</a>.)  Since I can only generate about <a href="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/how-much-electricity-can-human-generate/">50 W</a> of electricity while working at my desk, I have needed to pick my equipment carefully to stay within the limits of my capacity.</p>
<p>Below is a description of the equipment I use in my office, as well as some issues to consider if you are thinking of setting up a similar office for yourself.  (None of the links in this article are affiliate links, BTW.)  I also describe what my typical workday is like for the curious.</p>
<h2 id="my-office-equipment">My Office Equipment</h2>

<h3 id="laptop">Laptop</h3>
<p>In the past, I have used a 15” Dell Inspiron 3515” laptop or an 11” Acer <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/317464/acer-c720-chromebook-c720-2800">C720 Chromebook</a> with my desk.  These laptops consumed about 25 W and 10 W, respectively, in use.</p>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/c720-on-desk_hu8f462ba2f77a24b008535d8cfc24eaff_305223_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="338" alt="C720 Chromebook on my desk">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>my old C720</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Both these laptops are now several years old.  Newer laptops consume significantly less power.  My father-in-law’s <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Inspiron-11-3162-Subnotebook-Review.164692.0.html">11” Dell</a>, for instance, is roughly comparable to the C720 and draws only 6 W, while a typical 13-15” laptop consumes 12-20 W.  High-performance laptops may require more than this.</p>
<p>Note that all power consumption figures mentioned above assume the laptop’s battery is fully charged; if not, the power consumption will be far higher.  Most laptops consume about 40-50 W while charging until the battery reaches 80%, then gradually taper off to their fully-charged power consumption level.  If the laptop’s battery is fully depleted, charging can take 3 hours or more.  Unless you are looking for a real workout, it’s best to use a fully-charged laptop with a pedal-powered generator.</p>
<p>You can save a few watts of power by powering a laptop using a DC-DC adapter instead of the manufacturer’s AC power adapter.  That’s because a pedal generator normally produces DC electricity, and using an AC power adapter requires an extra DC-to-AC power conversion.</p>

<h3 id="desktop-computer">Desktop Computer</h3>
<p>I currently use a Friendly Arm <a href="https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=234">NanoPi M4</a> with 2G of RAM running Debian Linux as my main computer.</p>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/nano-pi-m4_hu3a3d120d308246afbfc2b3d5ca0eadb8_161613_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="NanoPi M4 mounted on rear of monitor">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>my NanoPi M4 mounted on the rear of my monitor</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This small single-board computer is similar to a Raspberry Pi 4, but more powerful and (in my opinion) better designed (e.g., it only needs a heat sink to keep it cool, not a cooling fan).  It consumes about 3 W of power under most circumstances, a few watts more when under heavy load.  It is powered via a USB type C cable through a USB port built into the desk.</p>
<p>I have found this little computer perfectly adequate for typical desktop tasks like managing email, listening to streaming music, browsing the web, and watching occasional YouTube videos, as well as writing software, creating 3D CAD drawings, and processing images.</p>
<p>The NanoPi M4 only runs Linux, so it’s not a viable option for Windows or MacOS users.   If you use Windows, an Intel NUC or other passively-cooled small computer would be a good alternative.  Choose a model with the lowest TDP (Thermal Design Power) needed for your workload.  This will minimize the power you need to generate.</p>
<p>I am not an expert on Apple computers, but I believe Apple has made some small-form-factor desktop computers that are fairly energy efficient that will run MacOS.</p>

<h3 id="monitor">Monitor</h3>
<p>I use a <a href="https://www.sceptre.com/overview-426.html">Sceptre E165W 16” LED monitor</a>.  It draws 3 W in use.</p>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/sceptre-16-led-monitor_hu98583dcf92cc00dfd25528488407dd79_144966_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="Sceptre 16 inch monitor mounted on desk">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>My monitor mounted on my desk</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The monitor is powered by a 12 V DC cable plugged directly into one of the four 12V DC sockets built into the desk, instead of using its AC power adapter.  This saves a couple of watts of power by avoiding a round-trip DC-to-AC-to-DC conversion.</p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this monitor, but if you’re a developer more accustomed to a 27” screen or multiple side-by-side monitors, you will probably want something larger.  If so, <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/most-efficient/me-certified-computer-monitors">choose your monitor</a> carefully, as some large monitors consume significant power.</p>

<h3 id="inkjet-printer">Inkjet Printer</h3>
<p>I use an <a href="https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-envy-4500-e-all-in-one-printer">HP Envy 4500</a> 3-in-1 multifunction inkjet printer, mostly for printing invoices and shipping labels.  It draws about 1 W when idle and 13 W when printing.  Other inkjet printer models seem to consume a similar amount of energy.</p>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/hp-envy-printer_huc0e15028204e9a6ffffd25a0d96d4c39_267578_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="354" alt="our HP Envy printer">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>our office printer</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the power switch is first turned on, this particular printer causes a 30 W power spike during initialization.   The sudden drop in voltage this caused would sometimes cause glitches in some of the other equipment I used.  I fixed this by adding extra filter capacitors to the pedal generator’s power supply system.</p>
<p>This printer is the only device in my office that does not have an external AC adapter, and therefore requires using a DC-to-AC inverter to power it.  This adds 2.5 W to its power consumption.</p>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/inverter_hud38f5ad7a439dbc7cfd5750ed38fccbc_259322_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="338" alt="75W inverter plugged into desk">

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you want to use a laser printer with a pedal-powered generator, forget it.  The heater used in laser printers to fuse the toner to the paper consume more power than you can reasonably supply yourself.</p>

<h3 id="modemrouter">Modem/Router</h3>
<p>We use a <a href="https://www.trendnet.com/products/product-detail?prod=270_TEW-723BRM">Trendnet DSL modem router</a> to provide internet service to our home office.  Like the monitor, it’s powered by a 12 V DC power cable plugged into one of the desk’s power sockets.</p>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/modem-router_huf56514a1d2470178cf56503452590cb1_136531_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="our Trendnet modem/router">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>our modem-router</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While it only draws 3 W of power, it is the largest energy consumer of all the equipment in our office, because it operates 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Our internet service is slow (12 Mbs).  Higher-speed internet service may require a router with a faster processor, which may consume much more energy than ours.</p>

<h3 id="cooling-fan">Cooling Fan</h3>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/cooling-fan_huc28429158cfe9eb0f9dcd912f556dc15_336680_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="683" alt="Cooler Guys 120 mm case fan I use to keep cool">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>this computer case fan helps keep me cool</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Pedaling for long periods can make you very warm.  To keep cool, I had been using the <a href="https://www.coolerguys.com/collections/fans/products/coolerguys-120mm-12v-low-speed-fan">Cooler Guys 120 mm computer case fan</a> pictured above until I accidently stuck a screwdriver into it while it was running and sheared off a blade.  Now I use a similarly-sized, generic-branded case fan I bought on Ebay.  The latter fan moves less air, is more noisy in some postions, but uses much less energy (3.3 W vs 6 W when running).  A standard 3-pin fan header on the desk’s circuit board supplies power for the fan.</p>

<h2 id="web-server">Web Server</h2>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/orange-pi-pc-plus_huc090b75c0460eee5b5e4be58731113bf_583342_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="338" alt="our Orange Pi Plus 2E web server">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>this website came to you from this web server</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My desk has an <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/orangepipcplus/">Orange Pi PC+</a> which serves the dashboard controlling my pedal generator’s power system.  Since I have it set up as a web server already, I decided to use it to <a href="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/pedal-powered-website/">serve this website</a> over the internet.  The web page you’re viewing now came from this computer.</p>

<h2 id="phones-and-tablets">Phones and Tablets</h2>
<p>My wife and I recharge our phones using the desk’s built-in USB power sockets.  The power consumed by a phone varies by phone model.  My phone draws a maximum of 10 W when it is low, while my wife’s phone draws about 6 W.</p>
<p>If you have a quick-charging phone or tablet, you may not be able to charge it at its maximum charging rate.  That’s because the USB power sockets are limited to a power output of 11 W.</p>

<h2 id="aaaaa-battery-charger">AA/AAA Battery Charger</h2>
<p>We use a lot of Ni-MH batteries and a few Li-ion around our home.  I charge them while I work using one of two chargers, a basic <a href="http://www.tenergy.com/01160">Tenergy 12-bay charger</a> and a more sophisticated <a href="http://www.miboxer.com/eng/p8.html">Miboxer C8 8-bay charger</a>.</p>




<figure>
    
        <img src="https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/my-human-powered-office/battery-chargers_hub80e4876b86caf3b79efa73412ebf8d2_677796_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="600" height="338" alt="our two battery chargers">
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>the two battery chargers I use</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Tenergy charger is used most often because it can hold more batteries; the Miboxer is used to charge batteries that the Tenergy can’t.  Both chargers are powered from one of the 12 V power sockets built into the desk.</p>
<p>Each charger consumes about 1 W per battery being charged.  A depleted battery in good condition can be recharged in about 3 hours.  Batteries in poor condition will draw less power when charging but take much more time to charge, due to their higher internal resistance.</p>

<h2 id="led-lights">LED lights</h2>
<p>We use most of the AA batteries mentioned above to power LED lights around our house.  We use these lights in lieu of standard desk lamps and ceiling lights.   Many of them have motion-sensing abilities so they don’t have to be physically turned on or off when entering or leaving a room.  They are an easy way to provide reliable, off-grid illumination.</p>
<p>Batteries in the most heavily-used lights are charged daily.  Batteries in lights used less often are charged on a three day schedule.  I spend more energy charging batteries in the winter than the summer because the nights are longer.</p>
<p>The AAA batteries are used in smaller lights, like headlamps and bicycle taillights, that consume less power than the household lights.  But, since the batteries have half the capacity of AA batteries, they have to be charged at approximately the same frequency as AA batteries.</p>

<h2 id="electric-shaver">Electric Shaver</h2>
<p>I use a <a href="http://www.remingtonproducts.com/products/mens/electric-shavers/rotary-shavers/pr1335b-remington-r3000-series-rotary-shaver.aspx">Remington R3000</a> electric shaver to shave each day.</p>




<figure>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>According to the specs on the power adapter, it should only draw 0.4 W when charging, making it well-suited for charging off a USB port.  Unfortunately, it has a non-standard charging voltage (4 V) and proprietary charging socket, so to charge it I’m forced to use it’s AC power adapter and a DC-to-AC inverter.   This increases it’s power consumption 5x (2.5 W).</p>
<h2 id="my-workday">My Workday</h2>
<p>I generally work on my computer 2-2.5 hours before breakfast, responding to email, writing code, and working on CAD drawings.  This is typically my most productive part of the day in terms of the total work (both office and physical) accomplished.</p>
<p>It is also the time of the day when I’m strongest.  I can generally maintain an electrical power output of 50-55 W.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever wondered how Elon Musk is running two billion-dollar companies at once? Musk is an interesting example of someone who manages his time so well that he can work 100 hours a week and still manage to take time out for his hobbies, family, and even Twitter! So, how does he do it?<br></p><p>Musk is known for using timeboxing methods to manage his time effectively. He uses timeboxing from the moment he wakes up in the morning where he assigns each time block to a certain task that he needs to accomplish on a given day. This timeboxing method can be used for any tasks ranging from writing emails, scheduling meetings, meditating or anything that you would like to do on a particular day.<br></p><p>Before I began using timeboxing, I learned about another technique called <strong>Themed days</strong>. I decided to combine both to maximize productivity. Themed days are <strong>strategically planned days in your calendar, which are entirely dedicated to one single thing or tasks from the same category</strong>. While timeboxing is <strong>to allocate a certain amount of time to a task in advance and then complete it within that time frame</strong>. The idea behind these two techniques is to eliminate context switching or minimize it.<br></p><p>How to use them? Very simple.<br></p><p>Make a list of 4-5 things you want to focus on this week. For example:</p><ol role="list"><li>☎️ Talk to 5 customers</li><li>💻️ Implement features X,Y &amp; Z</li><li>🎨 Redesign landing page</li><li>✍️ Write a blog post about productivity<br></li></ol><p>These are going to be your “themes”. Now open your calendar and assign a day for each one. Let’s say you want to work Monday and Tuesday on coding the missing features. Use Wednesday to interview customers, etc, you got the idea. (Tip: give each theme a color or an emoji 😉️)<br></p><p>Themed days could be super useful if you already have a day job and are trying to make time for your side hustle. Instead of trying to work on it one hour each day after your day job when you already feel exhausted, you dedicate a whole day for your side project.</p><p>With the one hour a day approach, the chance you could skip the scheduled hour is higher; <strong>with themed days, maintaining self-discipline is much easier.</strong></p><h2>Timeboxing</h2><p>To spice things up a little bit, you should use time timeboxing. Once you finished assigning themes and each day has one:</p><ol role="list"><li>Zoom in on each day</li><li>Add sub-tasks for that day’s theme</li><li>Add a time estimate to each task, and frame it with a start and end time.<br>‍<br></li></ol><p>You want to avoid any tasks without a clear deadline, even if the deadline is not accurate. According to Parkinson’s Law, if you have more time to finish a task, the overall time that you will take to finish the task will also expand. This holds true for many people and timeboxing greatly helps in dealing with that as well.<br></p><p>It’s important that as much as possible in Step 3 above, you avoid the <strong>mental optimistic bias</strong> of underestimating how long the completion of a task would require. When we’re too optimistic about how long a given task is going to take, we fail to completely follow through on what we set out to do.This bias, can be avoided by simply using a <strong>feedback loop, </strong>where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. At the end of each day or at least once a week, reflect on your progress and review the things you worked on that week and think to yourself how you could improve.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Timeboxing is amazing if you learn to do it effectively. In simple words, it is a process to merge your to-do list with your calendar. Another benefit of timeboxing is that it reduces the number of choices you’d have to make in any given moment — boosting your willpower for peak productivity.</p><h2>Productivity as an indie hacker</h2><p>To maximize your productivity, you must set your priorities straight. For me as a developer, I find myself investing the majority of my time coding, but as an indie hacker who wants to build a profitable business, I must focus on other stuff too; marketing, promoting, writing, and talking to customers. Themed days made me realize that <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/post/is-coding-a-procrastination-trap">coding could be a procrastination trap</a>.<br></p><p>Applying theme days helped me break out of the dev-hamster-wheel (aka coding) and forced me to do more of what needed to be done. So I decided to structure my themed days to look like this:<br></p><p><strong>Monday</strong>: Coding <br>‍<strong>Tuesday</strong>: Coding<strong><br>Wednesday</strong>: Writing / Learning<strong><br>Thursday</strong>: Coding&nbsp;<strong><br>Friday</strong>: Housekeeping / Reflecting&nbsp;<strong><br>Saturday</strong>: Marketing / SEO&nbsp;<strong><br>Sunday</strong>: Writing&nbsp;</p><p>As you see, I only code three days a week, so I can focus on other equally or sometimes even more important things.</p><p>I also found themed days to be very effective when it comes to dealing with new or unexpected tasks. Depending on the task’s "theme", I know precisely on which day it should be scheduled. It takes me a fraction of the time to add it to my system.<br></p><h2>Themed Inbox</h2><p>I took themed days an extra step and applied it to my Gmail inbox. With a <a href="https://www.axllent.org/docs/gmail-snooze-script/">super cool trick using Google Apps Script</a>, I have control over when emails hit my inbox. Instead of checking my email everyday and having dozens of unrelated emails, now emails show up in my inbox on the right day. For example, all unimportant emails are scheduled for Friday (my Housekeeping day), while all marketing &amp; SEO related emails come in on Saturday, and so on. This way I make sure I read the right email at the right time when I’m ready to act on it. So cool, right?<br></p><figure id="w-node-01d3452ce5a9-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8eb994e7219ad5c7a6_aacavebgfxMyaKY5fTJeYgq5iGSUGD-5kW-_E5b-80Oo0IdiLDzEmok9W3WkT5_U-_woBP59Bk2TJg2xCFos_w3fsecvjQiGpCcArpMwuSTAgkbBQkGZUL0fY1dDm_AIU3Vs5NiL.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The script automatically label emails</figcaption></figure><h2>Building a system: find a tool that works for you.</h2><p>When it comes to productivity in general, it’s important to have an efficient and flexible system that can adapt as your needs change without investing countless hours rebuilding everything from scratch.<br></p><p>Notion has been the core part of my system for the last five months. I’ve been experimenting a lot with different productivity techniques and approaches and it would have been so hard to do that without a super flexible and elegant tool like Notion. It's my second brain and where I store everything, so I’m using it to implement themed days, with Notion build-in templates.<br></p><p>I have a database where I have designed a template for each day and theme. Every morning, after preparing my coffee, I create a new page for that day using the proper template. The new page gets populated with everything I need to be as productive as possible on that day.<br></p><p>For example, on Saturday, which is a marketing/SEO day, I have a page with all the resources and reminders related to that subject.<br></p><figure id="w-node-5a939054f819-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8e51775d3896dd2ca8_IR7wRnLd7_xn6THm_98T9fff1sIPhOhPUMI39ZsvQZckACxBvIC6BGD4oOj2ke_tcSEynYyETcdgfdGl_6kFQibk_no8hh-5oawKs_-YBQTp8GeLS8dstn5kCNhbzySBkC7BNe7X.png" alt="my Notion templates"></p><figcaption>Notion template for each day of the week</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-fb4ef460147c-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8e1cd4becfc1e46ca2_RaH23NZlbiaNZOdoL6Pg-aIbRYxrnuE3L3A2-ttTweWCPEe_vbzW6XUu0d-Ycspa372e7ZdciYXHQsFhw_3jadOX_Soqdvqd_ohmn1ikovesCXtAMPrdljxuWiv9Gt15cxeWtB9x.png" alt="Saturday template"></p><figcaption>Saturday's template, focus on marketing &amp;&nbsp;SEO</figcaption></figure><p>What I found really nice about this approach is that my templates are not static, and as I keep updating them, they keep evolving and improving.</p><h2>Next level: Themed weeks</h2><p>If you really want to level up your game and accelerate your progress even further, you can implement themed weeks.</p><p>One of my favourite indie makers, <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook">Jon Yongfook</a>, has implemented themed weeks for his workflow. Jon works in a 2 weeks sprint, one week of coding, followed by one week of marking, and then wraps it up by writing a newsletter and changelog. When I asked him if he tried shorter sprints, he said that he did but found shorter sprints lead to too much context switching, and two weeks sprint works very well for him.<br></p><p>You can also use the same concept to devote the whole week to a single project, and really make huge advancements, or to a certain business function, and today, with all the rapid prototyping tools available, you could take a week to build an MVP/prototype and test your idea on the market.</p><h2>Give it a try and see for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The best way to see what themed days can do for your productivity is merely trying it out. Here's your homework:</p><ul role="list"><li>Make a list of 3-4 categories/themes you want to focus on (e.g writing, coding, marketing)</li><li>Break them down to atomic tasks, ideally each sub-task should take one hour or less</li><li>Map each theme to a day of the week</li><li>If you can’t find time on working days, try to do it on a Saturday.</li><li>Open your calendar</li><li>Timebox the sub-tasks by scheduling them on their dedicated day</li><li>Get excited -message me to hold you accountable- and do it!&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>I promise that afterwards, you will feel a sense of achievement and see the progress that can</p><p>be made with this approach.

October 17, 2020 | https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-kevin-scott-motivates-engineers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-kevin-scott-motivates-engineers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
Lex Friedman asked Microsoft CTO, Kevin Scott, what it takes to run a company of 30,000 engineers. 
</p>
<p>
Ambitious, smart engineers can go anywhere. How do you motivate them? How do you make them stay? 
</p>
<p>
Kevin responded that it had to do with storytelling. 
</p>
<p>
Not money. Not prestige. But with the right story. 
</p>
<p>
And it’s always been like this. Not just for engineers, but for humans in general. 
</p>
<p>
Stories make us come together. 
</p>
<p>
Numbers can help paint a picture. Revenue up. Costs down. 
</p>
<p>
But at the end of the day it’s the <em>words</em> that stick. 
</p>
<h2>Sapiens</h2>


<p>
In his book Sapiens, Yuval Harari explains that humans are special because they inhabit a world created from their own ideas in addition to their objective reality. 
</p>
<p>
He calls this our <em>fictional reality.</em> Things like money, nations, corporations - these are all things that we <em>invented</em>. 
</p>
<p>
Take something like gold, for example. You can’t eat gold. You can’t even make weapons out of gold because it’s too soft. 
</p>
<p>
So as humans, we take something with no inherent value like gold and we tell a story around it. We construct the narrative. 
</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_kevinscott/dual_reality.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
Think about the stories you tell yourself everyday. How much of them are based on your objective reality? 
</p>
<p>
Instead it’s probably the case that your mind is preoccupied by what Harari refers to as fictional reality. 
</p>
<p>
Stories are central to our evolution as a species. And it just so happens that this also holds true for companies. 
</p>
<h2>Apple</h2>


<p>
Steve Jobs was a great storyteller because he focused on the <em>why</em> over the <em>what</em>. 
</p>
<p>
In other words: he focused on fictional reality over objective reality. 
</p>
<p>
Take<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I"> this commercial</a> for the 1984 Macintosh. Not until the last few seconds is there even a mention of what’s being advertised. 
</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_kevinscott/mac.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
What often goes unnoticed is that these same principles are used to attract the best people at Apple. 
</p>
<p>
The best people, Jobs states, need a common vision. 
</p>
<p>
“<em>And that’s what leadership is. Leadership is having a vision, being able to articulate that so the people around you can understand it, and getting a consensus on a common vision.”</em>
</p>
<p>
And that vision needs to be reiterated. Constantly. 
</p>
<p>
I’ve <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/redesigning-apple-music-after-rejection">written about this</a> before, but one of the ways Jobs would do this is by creating a Reality Distortion Field. 
</p>
<p>
The reality distortion field was a mix of Jobs’ charisma, his strong will to succeed, and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.
</p>
<p>
It’s how he got his team to meet crazy deadlines and how he convinced the best to work with him. 
</p>

<h2>Keep it simple</h2>


<p>
Ask most people to pitch you their idea and it’ll probably sound really complicated.  
</p>
<p>
The magic lies in making it sound simple. Compelling. Inevitable, almost. 
</p>
<p>
Read most corporate mission statements. You’ll probably come away thinking “So what?”.
</p>
<p>
The details are important. The technology is important. The numbers matter. 
</p>

<p>But when it comes to leading a team, both those factors pale in comparison to having a clear vision and being able to tell a story.</p>

<p>And that’s how Kevin Scott motivates his 30,000 engineers to get out of bed everyday.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been continuously delivering software for about three years now and I've
gained some insight into what works and what doesn't (for us at least). Here's
what I've learned along the way.</p>
<!-- end -->
<h3>Debunking some myths right off the bat</h3>
<ul>
<li>This isn't about making it easy for anyone to push bad code into master
without a care in the world.</li>
<li>This isn't about going to production without testing your code.</li>
<li>This isn't incompatible with testing practices such as TDD.</li>
<li>This isn't about promoting a haphazard approach with an emphasis on rushing to
get changes out without caring about quality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Continuous Delivery?</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html">Martin Fowler</a>
puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build
software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any
time.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is how the folks over at
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/">AWS</a> define it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are
automatically prepared for a release to production. A pillar of modern
application development, continuous delivery expands upon continuous
integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a
production environment after the build stage. When properly implemented,
developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed
through a standardized test process.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Testing new code vs testing existing code</h3>
<p>In a Continuous Delivery environment every change you make goes through a
Deployment Pipeline, which builds the software using a CI system such as
CircleCI and runs all the unit tests, integrated tests and acceptance tests in
order to determine if your change breaks anything. Therefore, if your change is
lucky enough to reach the end of the Deployment Pipeline without breaking
anything, you can be confident it can be deployed to production at any time.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember here is that your change itself does <strong>NOT</strong> need to
be tested before it goes to production, unless it affects end users. If your
change is a smaller part of a bigger feature that won't be released to end users
for a while yet, you can push it to production during development behind a
feature flag with the confidence end users won't be affected. When in the early
stages of development, the focus of the Deployment Pipeline is to ensure your
change doesn't break existing functionality in production. There isn't really
much value in testing the new code, certainly not on day one when there is
barely anything to test. As development continues, you work alongside your team
to increase the test coverage as more functionality is added. During this time,
the purpose of the Deployment Pipeline gradually shifts more and more towards
providing confidence the new functionality works correctly as well as checking
for regressions.</p>
<p>In other words, testing isn't a barrier for going to production because you will
be going to production from the very moment you start working on a new feature.
Testing is just as important as ever but now, you write your tests <em>while</em>
continuously going to production instead of trying to get everything perfect up
front <em>before</em> going to production. It's a very different approach. It requires
a mindset shift and in some cases unlearning habits you may have held close for
years!</p>
<h3>It's a huge mindset shift for developers</h3>
<p>In order for Continuous Delivery to work, developers must become accustomed to
committing changes to the main branch <em>"at least once a day"</em> as a general
guideline (this is actually a requirement of Continuous Integration which is a
prerequisite for Continuous Delivery). It's a guideline only, however - a way to
encourage developers to become familiar with working this way. But after a
while, most developers I work with couldn't tell you whether they commit once a
day or not - it's usually more often actually. As long as the PRs are small and
deployable, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I've found getting started with this is by far the most difficult part of
switching to CD though. Developers just hate working this way initially - I
should know, it happened to me! Most developers prefer to create a branch and
work on it for days at a time in isolation, with the freedom to contemplate all
the variants and consider all the use-cases. But with Continuous Delivery, often
even a simple task must be broken down further and when you create a PR,
sometimes it only contains a small part of the overall solution. Rather than
working on functionality in isolation then delivering the entire piece at the end,
you must become comfortable continuously delivering small parts of the overall
solution and potentially exposing code that is often a work-in-progress or an
experiment that may have to be rethought later on. It takes quite a while to get
used to this, but eventually it becomes second nature and all is forgiven once you
start noticing the benefits of this way of working.</p>
<h3>DEPLOY TO PROD != DONE &amp;&amp; DEPLOY TO PROD != RELEASE</h3>
<p>With Continuous Delivery the definition of "deploy to prod" changes dramatically
and that can be a very difficult thing to adapt to. We used to have this so
ingrained into our culture and process, we didn't even realise it was a thing!
We would say <em>"deploy to prod"</em> all day long and it would be implied to mean
<em>"it's done, it's ready for release"</em>. Suddenly, as we started to gradually
switch some of our services to CD, "deploy to prod" meant something completely
different! This was an extremely difficult issue for us to resolve and it took
time. It's often not enough to just communicate it - it has to be learned
gradually over time and through incremental process changes and ongoing
discussions with all teams involved.</p>
<p>This is also complicated by the fact that tickets often also have a "definition
of done", common when using agile frameworks such as SCRUM. Even when talking
about a specific ticket though, <em>"deploying to production"</em> doesn't necessarily
mean the ticket is done. A single ticket may require several PRs and each one
will be deployed to production separately. A single ticket is considered "done"
when all the functionality in the ticket is in production and tested.</p>
<p>I cover more on why deploying to production is not the same as making a release
below as this is where Feature Flags come in.</p>
<h3>Learning to embrace Feature Flags</h3>
<p>Feature flags are a pretty simple idea, but in practice they can be quite
controversial. They are very easy to abuse and if they aren't managed correctly,
they can make your codebase overly complex and difficult to reason about.</p>
<p>But when utilized properly, they are a valuable way to allow developers to
deliver "under development" functionality to production on a daily basis. While
your end users are working away using your software, they will be oblivious to
the fact that you are delivering a new "work-in-progress" feature before their
very eyes. The feature is there, they just can't see it because it's behind a
feature flag.</p>
<p>Using specialized software such as <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">Launch Darkly</a>,
it's possible to control feature flags from a central admin interface and even
turn flags on and off for individual users or groups of users. This is ideal for
testing/demo purposes when you want to show off a new feature prior to release.
And when it's finally time to release the feature to everyone, you simply turn
the flag on and it just appears to end users as if it was always there all along
(because it was! It was just hidden from them).</p>
<h3>This all sounds like hard work - why bother?</h3>
<p>Here are just a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment to production becomes routine and frictionless.</li>
<li>It enables us to deliver high quality functionality to our customers quicker
with less hassle.</li>
<li>We are able to deliver small increments of end user value, so it's easy
to adapt to change as we learn more about the needs of our customers.</li>
<li>Feature Flags allow us to gradually roll out features to select groups of
users to try them out before the full launch.</li>
<li>We never worry about deploying on a Friday!</li>
<li>There is no lengthy release procedure - it's as simple as clicking a button.</li>
<li>Our PRs are small and simple, which allows us to do in-depth reviews without
them taking too much time.</li>
<li>We rarely have to deal with merge conflicts and if we do they are small and
it's easy to identify what the different changes represent and how best to
resolve the conflicts.</li>
<li>When something goes wrong it's much easier to identify the problem because the
changes are small.</li>
<li>We don't put off production issues until right at the end, so things like
production configuration, scalability concerns, issues affecting end users,
and so on are all dealt with up front and continuously considered during
development.</li>
<li>We can deploy bug fixes to production extremely quickly, sometimes within an
hour of them being reported, almost always within the same day.</li>
<li>We can demo new features to stakeholders <em>in production</em> during the various
stages of development (usually at the end of each sprint) without affecting
end-users.</li>
<li>We don't need complex branching strategies. We don't even need branches
really. It's perfectly fine to merge directly to master. We only branch so we
can get the benefit of peer reviews through GitHub Pull Requests but even
then, our branches are usually small and short lived.</li>

                <div id="mobile-panel">
                    

<article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>What follows is an <strong>unedited guest post by the author of <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/">Applied Divinity Studies</a></strong> about Substack. While I don't necessarily endorse everything said in the text that follows, I thought it was an interesting post and the author asked me to guest-post it here.</p>
<p>Some thoughts of my own as a prologue: </p>
<p>Looking at things I read in my RSS I notice first that indeed I look at <em>my RSS reader</em> (Feedly), and not at my mailbox. RSS is a civilized way of following updates from disparate sites you like, aggregating them in one central place that's separate from the mailbox where they can be saved to be read later, organized by source if need be. Newsletters —stuff that hits your inbox— strike me as barbaric. We solved the problem of centralization of consumption of diverse sources and then at some point there was some collective forgetting?? Maybe for a business that doesn't have a corporate blog a newsletter (With news about the sender) makes more sense, but blogs-via-RSS do not find a good replacement in the form of spammy inbox periodicals. One argument for newsletters is that it allows senders to track metrics about who reads their work, how much they read, etc. In Nintil for example while I have some Google Analytics metrics, I have zero information if you read it via RSS and not open the page; but I don't care, I don't even know off the top of my head how many people read Nintil every month; the reason I have Analytics is to tell me from where my blog is being cited, so I can follow the discussion about what I have written elsewhere. Nintil is not written for an audience I carefully cultivate. If you like Nintil you are free enjoy it (no paywalls here) and if you don't you can read something else. Because of that, I don't have a pressure to keep writing blogposts all the time, or feel the urge to squeeze a post out of the random daily occurrence just to be able to push the daily post. </p>
<p>But not every publication is a vehicle of self-expression. Monetized newsletters are there to make money. And that's fine. But paid content seems to fall into one of a few buckets: either politics (hooliganism ensures you'll pay) or businessy/financey pieces (Because reading may give you an edge somehow, or so you think). Who would pay (regularly!) for Nintil? If you like Nintil, you can donate via Patreon. Nintil is also the production of public goods (Like my Longevity FAQ; there I offer you months of research, for free, open to everyone), which is also incompatible with the paid model.</p>
<p>Do I read any substacks? I use <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">kill the newsletter</a> to convert newsletters into well behaved RSS feeds, and perusing my stash of feeds I can see Nadia Eghbal's and Anton Howes'. This will be no surprise given what I said above: My interests do not lie in operating businesses or following current events <sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup>, and that seems to be the bulk of what the Substacks are about. Not that I have tried particularly hard to scan their repertoire for something that I may like more.</p>
<p>
  [1]. You will have noticed that Nintil is an oasis in a desert of covidposting :)
</p>
<p>So by no means I can be a qualified critic of Substack; first because I am not that well aware of the various 'stacks, second because they seem to target an audience I am not part of. It would be as if I wrote beer (All beers taste equally awful to me) reviews; the problem would be me, not the various beers.</p>
<p>This all said, there is something to be said for being paid to write and it's good that there exist platforms that allow people interested in publishing under that model. I am not making a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sandel/markets-morals">Sandelian</a> critique here, I very much am a proponent of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Markets-without-Limits-Jason-Brennan/dp/0415737354">markets in everything</a>, but I also want this blog to be fully unpaywalled (I'm not selling you a product, after all), and I wish the same were true of other blogs (or newsletters); moreover I don't think paywalling content will lead to better quality <em>unless</em> the author is working full time on it. Is there a moral case for supererogatory open blogging? Probably.</p>
<p>Now, the guest post. Enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The style will often be strange, incorrect, overburdened, and loose, and almost always strong and bold. Writers will be more anxious to work quickly than to perfect details. Short works will be commoner than long books, wit than erudition, imagination than depth. There will be a rude and untutored vigor of thought with great variety and singular fecundity. Authors will strive to astonish more than to please, and to stir passions rather than to charm taste.</p>

<p>De Tocqueville’s indictment of American style is equal parts exoneration. If things have always been bad, we can hardly blame new media for the decline of society.</p>
<p>And yet, each time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpG11vFqglA">a new platform claims to be the exception to the rule</a>, it bears repeating, as many times as it takes, that this is not a good state of affairs.</p>
<p>I’ve rewritten this post three times, each more dogmatic than the last. So I’ve decided to forsake all the flashy rhetoric and just soberly explain the structural mechanics behind Substack’s relentlessly milquetoast taste.</p>
<h3 id="homogeneity-within-newsletters">Homogeneity Within Newsletters</h3>
<p>Top substack writers all have a clear focus. The Dispatch writes about politics, Matt Stoller writes about monopolies, Bill Bishop covers China.</p>
<p>Isn’t this normal? After all, no writer can be expected to cover every topic. In an age of disaggregation, we should read from experts instead of <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/28/polymath/">casual polymaths</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, the apparent normality obscures its historical peculiarity.</p>
<p>Consider SlateStarCodex, one of the most popular blogs in a pre-Substack era. It had posts ranging from <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/17/slightly-skew-systems-of-government/">political science fiction</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/15/the-vision-of-vilazodone-and-vortioxetine/">pharmacology</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/10/the-obligatory-gpt-3-post/">artificial intelligence</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/09/11/update-on-my-situation/">media economics</a>. That’s not a selective assortment, it’s his last few posts in chronological order.</p>
<p>(Or consider Nintil, which covers everything from <a href="https://nintil.com/longevity">longevity</a>, to <a href="https://nintil.com/better-science">meta-science</a>, to <a href="https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma">education</a> and <a href="https://nintil.com/pascals-mugging">decision theory</a>.)</p>
<p>Heterogeneity works for blogs since you grow through an occasional viral hit, and gain loyal readership through the occasional post that strikes a reader just right. As SlateStarCodex’s author <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3ygr2w/why_is_scott_alexander_sorta_popular/">describes his success</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granting the premises, maybe because I write a lot of stuff? There are about 500 SSC articles, one every couple of days. Even if I'm no better than anyone else, there are a lot more opportunities for people to stumble across the one that they like, be impressed, and start following me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is not merely homogeneity of topic, but homogeneity of substance. If you have to publish a newsletter every week, you don’t have the room or incentive to take risks.</p>
<p>In financial terms, blog posts have asymmetric returns with capped downside but unlimited upside. If you write a bad post it won’t get shared and no one will see it. If you write a great post and it goes viral, everyone on the internet thinks you’re a genius. Since content is shared organically, your best work gets way more exposure than your worst. The incentive in these situations is to ramp up variance and do the most interesting writing you can muster.</p>
<p>That dynamic is also good for readers. If a piece is bold but wrong, you can just close the tab. If it’s bold but right, you’ve hit a gold mine. Since readers can be massively diversified across authors, they can benefit from increased variance in the underlying assets while insulated from associated risk. In the Blogosphere, Twitterverse and even on Medium, readers could enjoy long tail upside without commensurate cost.</p>
<p>In contrast, every single edition of a newsletter is delivered to every single reader, and since a lot of it is paywalled, there’s little potential virality. This is aggravated by the one way valve on subscribers: one someone churns out, they’re unlikely to give you a second try. So the ensuing incentive is not to take any bold risks, avoid alienating readers, and write whatever will appeal to your current audience.</p>
<p>This might sound true for other newsletters, but not for yours. After all, you’re an interesting person, and you have interesting thoughts. More importantly, your readers are smart people who demand insight!</p>
<p>The problem is that like pop-music, pop-science and all other pop-culture, pop-writing can only appeal to the largest common denominator. Even if the author and readers are interesting people in isolation, aggregation forces this blob of individuals into a milquetoast morass. As David Foster Wallace <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qN9Z9UQWwsgC&amp;pg=PP35&amp;lpg=PP35&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cpeople+tend+to+be+extremely+similar+in+their+vulgar+and+prurient+and+dumb+interests+and+wildly+different+in+their+refined+and+aesthetic+and+noble+interests.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AjrMDxtfb7&amp;sig=ACfU3U3-gMCmnE9nVX7fjG_K2cDvjw4sVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjls7yHrJvsAhWxMn0KHYCQAj0Q6AEwA3oECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cpeople%20tend%20to%20be%20extremely%20similar%20in%20their%20vulgar%20and%20prurient%20and%20dumb%20interests%20and%20wildly%20different%20in%20their%20refined%20and%20aesthetic%20and%20noble%20interests.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">once described it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is of course undeniable that television is an example of Low Art, the sort of art that has to please people in order to get their money ...this is a logical function of its need to attract and please Audience. And I'm not saying television is vulgar and dumb because the people who compose Audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests, and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests. It's all about syncretic diversity: neither medium nor Audience is faultable for quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="homogeneity-across-newsletters">Homogeneity Across Newsletters</h3>
<p>Still, homogeneity within newsletters might not sound like such a crime. If each person is an expert in their domain, a reader still has the option of reading broadly and getting a taste of each hermetic utopia.</p>
<p>Except that structural forces also ensure a homogeneity across newsletters, ensuring that you never read anything too original.</p>
<h4 id="global-ranking">Global Ranking</h4>
<p>Subcultures allow for an escape from status as a zero-sum game. If you’re the <a href="https://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2006/10/economics-of-status.html">king of your own world</a>, you don’t feel bad for being at the bottom of someone else’s social ladder (<a href="https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society#external-links">1</a>, <a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">2</a>). Bloggers know they aren’t universally popular, but it doesn’t matter as long as you have your corner of the internet.</p>
<p>In contrast, Substack totally violates <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/01/23/social-capital-in-silicon-valley/">Social Fog of War</a> by instituting a <a href="https://substack.com/discover?utm_source=substack#top-paid">global leader board</a>…</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    



<p>tldr; Generalists are useful for injecting energy</p>

<p>I’ve recently moved from a large company (~1000 people) to a small company (&lt;10 people), and it has given me a new perspective on the usefulness of generalists. I have spent most of my career working in small companies, and moving abruptly from the largest company I’ve worked for back to a small company has shed some light on the differences for me.</p>

<p>Here, I’d like to focus on how I see the utility of generalists, and their roles inside companies.</p>



<p>First, I’d like to address the elephant in the room related to being a generalist. I have often see people refer to themselves as “generalists” because they actually weren’t very good at anything - hence “jack of all trades, master of none”. I have referred to myself as a generalists while trying to defend my ego from people who were much more competent than myself.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this post, I’d like to refer to generalists in good faith. That is, people who are truly competent at a broad array of things. The most common trait that I have seen among generalists is that they get bored very quickly if pigeonholed. It is unlikely that you would find a generalist toiling away on the same problem for years unless the problem is highly complex and multi-faceted - like, say starting a business.</p>



<p>What I have seen of generalists is that they tend to add energy to the projects that they are working on because they like bouncing around to everyone else’s job. If you don’t have an “everyone else”, then this arrangement works out very well. This leads me to a single rule (here specified as two sides of a spectrum):</p>

<ol>
<li>If you want to get nothing done on a large project, add generalists</li>
<li>If you want to get anything done on small projects, add generalists</li>
</ol>

<p>Generalists can move the ball forward on many fronts, and they often have a knack for seeing where things are lacking due to their expertise in many things. This makes them crucial to small projects because they can see and fill holes that others won’t. However, they can cause havoc on larger projects because they will be stepping on toes.</p>

<h2 id="stepping-on-toes">Stepping on toes</h2>

<p>I’m going to make up an example to explain how generalists may cause problems on larger teams.</p>

<p>Let’s say that it’s Bill’s job to do unit economic analysis. New information is presented to Tanya the Generalist (now officially employed as a marketing manager), and she wants to understand unit economics more deeply to make marketing decisions. Fortunately, she used to be a financial analyst at a medium sized business. She uses Bill’s original unit economic analysis to make her own. As a singular incident, this may actually be great. The team has an improved unit economic analysis, and the marketing decisions were made quickly.</p>

<p>But what if this happens 3 times a week? If it’s only Tanya, this might be fine. Indeed, Tanya may be greatly rewarded for her initiative.</p>

<p>Let’s take it a step further, and say that this project has 75 people, and 25 of them behave like Tanya. On smaller teams, this behavior was rewarded, so we should certainly not fault them for acting this way.</p>

<p>If 25 people are constantly creating new unit economics models (ok, this example is starting to feel stretched, but bear with me), then why is Bill even there? Who should use which model? Which one is the most up to date? Tanya made a really useful one the other day, but now Rob has yet a different one, and Arjun will have yet a better one tomorrow. Now, everyone is going to Rob, Tanya, and Arjun (and maybe several others) for their unit economics model.</p>

<p>What they <em>should</em> do is send the information they have to Bill, and let Bill manage the model. In this case, making their own models may be a way to communicate this which would make the problem much less severe.</p>

<p>But remember, these people are generalists. They don’t just do 2 things, they do lots of them. Now they’re also drawing up designs for advertisements, reaching out to prospects, and changing priorities of the engineers. Obviously, on a large project, this would be chaos. If things got done, they would happen in spite of the generalists, not because of them. These projects need people who are focused and dedicated to a single function.</p>

<p>However, if you’re short-staffed on a small project, these people are a godsend. Keeping them busy with a few different roles will keep them happy, and it will make your understaffed project acheivable.</p>



<p>It is easy to promote generalists to management because they are able to see the holes between teams and have a desire to work more closely with members of other teams and departments. However, the movement to management should be more carefully considered. It is often (but not always) the case that managers need to execute a specific set of routines in order to be good managers. If these routines are rigidly defined, management will not be a good place for a generalist because these routines will bore them as well.</p>

<p>The most successful places that I’ve seen for generalists are either small companies that need people who can wear many hats or at large companies in positions that act like consultants. Both of these types of roles allow the generalists to move between projects and priorities; keeping them happy, helping the company, and minimizing chaos.</p>

<p>We wrote on 21<sup>st</sup> September that we were in a crisis and put forward a ten point plan to avoid a new national lockdown in England. The points were not implemented and the crisis has worsened considerably. Daily confirmed cases are now almost 20,000 a day – four times what they were on 21<sup>st</sup> September. Hospital admissions and deaths are three times as high. Test results are taking longer, fewer new cases and contacts are being reached and those that are, are reached later. SAGE noted that Test and Trace was now providing at best marginal impact on reducing transmission. About a third of the population has been living under current “tier 2” restrictions since mid September. The remainder has been living under current “tier 1” restrictions since 25<sup>th</sup> September. Cases have continued to rise despite these and although cases are highest in the North of England, they are rising rapidly across the country. We do not believe the current tiered system is sufficient to reverse the growth of the pandemic. </p>



<p>On 21<sup>st</sup> September, SAGE scientists recommended a two week “circuit breaker” where we return to a similar level of restrictions as in late May, followed by a period of continued restrictions sufficient to keep the “reproduction ratio” R below 1 while allowing schools to stay open. A new study, whose authors include members of the SAGE modelling subgroup, estimated that a circuit breaker could save thousands of lives and “reset the clock” to buy us time. </p>



<p><strong>We agree</strong>. However, the time bought by a circuit breaker and continuing restrictions <strong>must</strong> be used to prepare for how we can re-open the economy safely, learning the lessons from this summer and autumn.</p>

<p>First impressions are important and one of the first things people see when someone shares your article is the <em>social image</em>.</p>
<p>In the worst case, it is a blank image because something went wrong or the meta tags weren’t set properly. In the best case, it is a hand made graphic that feels luxurious somehow, and shows our users that a lot of effort has gone into producing the content.</p>
<p>Twitter also tells us that “Tweets with photos receive an average 35% boost in Retweets” (see <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2014/what-fuels-a-tweets-engagement.html" rel="nofollow">What fuels a Tweet’s engagement?</a>)</p>

<p>Doing a custom image for each post or sharable page in your app takes a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>But wait, I forgot. We’re programmers. We’ll automate it.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal-1">The goal</h3>
<p>We’re going to look at how we can programatically create social images like these:</p>
<p><a data-type="image" data-caption="" href="https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/example-images-3.png" title="" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/example-images-3.png"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are real images that were generated for the <a href="https://pace.dev/blog" rel="nofollow">Pace blog</a> using code from this post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The images are hopefully attractive, informative and unique.</p>
<h3 id="render-images-with-the-standard-library-2">Render images with the standard library</h3>
<p>The standard library is very low level. We’ll explore it a little here, but later I’m going to use <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/fogleman/gg" rel="nofollow">Michael Fogleman’s gg package</a>, which provides an abstraction and much simpler API.</p>
<p>The standard library provides lots of packages that deal with rendering images and fonts.</p>
<p>The <code>image/draw</code> package provides a simple but powerful function called <code>Draw</code>:</p>
<pre><code>func Draw(dst Image, r image.Rectangle, src image.Image, sp image.Point, op Op)
</code></pre>
<p>This function lets you copy pixels from one image to another (specifically onto a <code>draw.Image</code> type).</p>
<h4 id="rectangles-3">Rectangles</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/image/#Rect" rel="nofollow">image.Rect</a> function creates an <code>image.Rectangle</code> describing an area on the image.</p>
<p>Here is the source code for the <code>Rectangle</code> type:</p>
<pre><code>// A Rectangle contains the points with Min.X &lt;= X &lt; Max.X, Min.Y &lt;= Y &lt; Max.Y.
// It is well-formed if Min.X &lt;= Max.X and likewise for Y. Points are always
// well-formed. A rectangle's methods always return well-formed outputs for
// well-formed inputs.
//
// A Rectangle is also an Image whose bounds are the rectangle itself. At
// returns color.Opaque for points in the rectangle and color.Transparent
// otherwise.
type Rectangle struct {
	Min, Max Point
}
</code></pre>
<p>It contains two <code>Point</code> types:</p>
<pre><code>// A Point is an X, Y coordinate pair. The axes increase right and down.
type Point struct {
	X, Y int
}
</code></pre>
<p>With these two structures, we can describe a 2D rectange.</p>
<p>When working with images in Go, you will spend a lot of time working with boxes using this type, so it’s worth a quick overview of how it works.</p>
<p>The rectangle holds a start position (x0, y0) and an end position (x1, y1). Notice the rectangle does <em>not</em> hold a width and height, instead the second pair of coordinates desctibe the end point.</p>
<p>A box that is 100 x 100 pixels might be described like this:</p>
<pre><code>image.Rect(0, 0, 100, 100)
</code></pre>
<p>or a 100 x 100 box might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>image.Rect(100, 100, 200, 200)
</code></pre>
<p>A 20 x 20 box in the middle of that could be described like this:</p>
<pre><code>image.Rect(40, 40, 60, 60)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="drawing-solid-rectangles-4">Drawing solid rectangles</h4>
<p>To give you an example of how low-level rendering with the standard library is, let’s have a quick look at how we might draw a filled red rectangle onto our image.</p>
<p>An <code>image.Image</code> can be a uniform colour if we use <code>image.Uniform</code> type, from which we can copy to draw solid rectangles.</p>
<pre><code>redImage := &amp;image.Uniform{color.RGBA{0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF}}
draw.Draw(img, image.Rect(10, 10, 30, 30), &amp;image.Uniform{blue}, image.ZP, draw.Src)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>To see why it is designed like this, take a look at the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/image/#Image" rel="nofollow">image.Image interface</a>. It describes the colour model and the size of the image, but the only way to read data from the image is via the <code>At(x, y int) color.Color</code> method, which reads the colour at a single pixel. Pretty low level, right?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="writing-text-5">Writing text</h4>
<p>Social images often contain the title of the article or page, so this means we need to render text onto an <code>draw.Image</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/golang/freetype" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/golang/freetype</a> package is the font rasteriser for Go, and after a quick glance at the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/freetype/raster" rel="nofollow">github.com/golang/freetype/raster</a> package, you will have a new appreciation for how fonts work.</p>
<p>We can create a <code>NewContext</code> and use <code>DrawString</code> to write some text.</p>
<pre><code>var (
	img 	 = image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, 320, 240))
	x, y 	 = 50, 50
	fontSize = 12.0
	label 	 = "Hi there"
)

ctx := freetype.NewContext()
dc.SetDst(img)
pt := freetype.Pt(x, y+int(c.PointToFixed(fontSize)&gt;&gt;6))
if _, err := dc.DrawString(label, pt); err != nil {
	return err
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it’s a very different proposition than creating an HTML file with <code>&lt;p&gt;Hi there&lt;/p&gt;</code> in it.</p>
<h4 id="encoding-and-saving-image-files-6">Encoding and saving image files</h4>
<p>To save an <code>image.Image</code> as a usable file, we need to encode it to JPG or PNG (or GIF if you want to make animated images).</p>
<p>We do this using the <code>image/jpg</code>, <code>image/png</code>, or <code>image/gif</code> packages and you usually write code like this:</p>
<pre><code>func SavePNG(img image.Image, filename string) error {
	f, err := os.Create(filename)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer f.Close()
	if err := png.Encode(f, img); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="render-images-using-7">Render images using <code>gg</code> package</h3>
<p><a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/fogleman/gg" rel="nofollow">Michael Fogleman’s gg package</a> provides an abstraction on top the standard library that provides a very simple, programmer friendly API with <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/gg/tree/master/examples" rel="nofollow">lots of examples</a> for us to poke around and take code snippets from.</p>
<p>The API is nicely designed, and allows us to write much more readable code. For example, to draw a red circle and save it as a PNG, we can write code like this:</p>
<pre><code>dc := gg.NewContext(1000, 1000) 		// canvas 1000px by 1000px
dc.DrawCircle(500, 500, 400) 			// a circle in the middle
dc.SetRGB(0xFF, 0x00, 0x00) 			// choose colour
dc.Fill() 								// fill the circle
err := dc.SavePNG("out.png") 			// save it
if err != nil {
	return errors.Wrap(err, "save png")
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is much simpler than doing so using just the standard library, so we’ll use <code>gg</code> to render our social images.</p>
<h4 id="choose-a-size-for-the-image-8">Choose a size for the image</h4>
<p>When we create a new <code>gg.Context</code> we specify the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> in pixels.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://louisem.com/217438/twitter-image-size" rel="nofollow">best advice I could find on the optimum size for social images on louisem.com</a> suggested a size for mobile of <em>1200 x 628</em> (although it seems to change a lot, so it’s worth checking before you decide).</p>
<p>1200 x 628 is astonishing considering I remember programming on an Amiga with a screen resolution of 320×200.</p>
<h4 id="write-a-program-to-generate-the-images-9">Write a program to generate the images</h4>
<p>Now we’re ready to start our program.</p>
<p>We’ll create a <code>gg.Context</code> after some Go boilerplate:</p>
<pre><code>import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/fogleman/gg"
)

func main() {
	if err := run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func run() error {
	dc := gg.NewContext(1200, 628)
	// todo, more programming
}
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll build up our image generator by adding code to the <code>run</code> function.</p>
<h4 id="render-an-image-file-10">Render an image file</h4>
<p>All of our blog posts have a primary image. We will load it, resize it, and use it as the background for our social image.</p>
<p>User experience experts will no doubt give you lots of reasons why having these images the same is important, but I know that I like the fact that the user can tap something on Twitter or Facebook, and then land immediately on the right page, and havinng the same images on both helps us tell that story.</p>
<p>So assuming you have a nice image file (as <code>backgroundImageFilename</code>), we’ll load it and draw it into the <code>gg.Context</code>.</p>
<pre><code>backgroundImage, err := gg.LoadImage(backgroundImageFilename)
if err != nil {
	return errors.Wrap(err, "load background image")
}
dc.DrawImage(backgroundImage, 0, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>This article assumes the images are the same size. If they are not, you will need to consider using the <a href="https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/github.com/disintegration/imaging" rel="nofollow">github.com/disintegration/imaging</a> package to resize them to fill the entire image.</p>
<pre><code>backgroundImage = imaging.Fill(backgroundImage, dc.Width(), dc.Height(), imaging.Center, imaging.Lanczos)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="save-the-image-file-11">Save the image file</h4>
<p>Getting near-to-live feedback as we code is especially important for visual tasks like these. So we’ll dedicate a little effort into creating the output image so we can see our images evolve as we go.</p>
<p>The <code>gg</code> package makes this very easy for us.</p>
<pre><code>if err := dc.SavePNG(outputFilename); err != nil {
	return errors.Wrap(err, "save png")
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running this code will produce an image like this:</p>
<p><a data-type="image" data-caption="" href="https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/0.png" title="" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/0.png"></a></p>
<p>We’re going to add some more layers to our image, so remember to keep the <code>SavePNG</code> code at the end so your changes aren’t ignored. (Anything you draw onto the image after savinng it won’t be seen.)</p>
<h4 id="add-a-semi-transparent-overlay-12">Add a semi-transparent overlay</h4>
<p>To ensure our text can be seen, we’re also going to add a semi-transparent black rectangle overlay too.</p>
<p>We’ll leave a margin to provide a full-colour border effect.</p>
<pre><code>margin := 20.0
x := margin
y := margin
w := float64(dc.Width()) - (2.0 * margin)
h := float64(dc.Height()) - (2.0 * margin)
dc.SetColor(color.RGBA{0, 0, 0, 204})
dc.DrawRectangle(x, y, w, h)
dc.Fill()
</code></pre>
<p>After calculating the dimensions of the overlay, we set the colour to <code>color.RGBA{0, 0, 0, 204}</code> which is black at 80% opacity (204 is 80% of 255).</p>
<p>We draw the rectangle and fill it.</p>
<p><a data-type="image" data-caption="" href="https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/1.png" title="" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/1.png"></a></p>
<h4 id="add-text-13">Add text</h4>
<p>Since these images are going to be used in a blog context, we are going to show the post title as the primary text on the image.</p>
<p>Your users will want to know where the content comes from, so we’ll write our brand logo to the bottom right hand corner, and the blog domain on the left.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the branding logo. We’ll need to load a font, and calculate a rectangle to write the text into.</p>
<pre><code>fontPath := filepath.Join("fonts", "OpenSans-Bold.ttf")
if err := dc.LoadFontFace(fontPath, 80); err != nil {
	return errors.Wrap(err, "load font")
}
dc.SetColor(color.White)
s := "PACE."
marginX := 50.0
marginY := -10.0
textWidth, textHeight := dc.MeasureString(s)
x = float64(dc.Width()) - textWidth - marginX
y = float64(dc.Height()) - textHeight - marginY
dc.DrawString(s, x, y)
</code></pre>
<ul>

          <p><img src="https://iamevan.me/images/posts/Psychological-Safety-And-The-Only-Pyramid-Scheme-That-Works.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A lot of my job is about safety. Safety prevents errors from happening but, more importantly, when people feel safe, things become safer.</p>
<p>It’s a strange phenomenon that I’ve seen time and time again where if you lay out processes and tools that make things like software deployments safer, the effects continue to compound long after the change has happened. As people feel more and more secure in doing deployments, raising issues and speaking confidently in a company, the amount of failure goes down.</p>
<p>Conversely, the more <em>unsafe</em> an environment, the more failure compounds. When people feel ridiculed or judged for raising their hand to call out an error or a bug they <em>think</em> might be happening, they will raise their hand less and less. As people feel less confident about speaking out, more and more failure goes unmonitored until it’s too late.</p>
<p>Not to mention, people in safer environments are <em>happier</em>. Which environment would you rather work in: a technically brilliant project dictated by one or two people with no room for opinion or discussion; or a project outlined by a senior colleague who asked for feedback regularly and gave your opinion serious consideration and discussion even if it didn’t make it into the final product? A lot of feeling safe is about feeling valued.</p>
<h2 id="maslows-hierarchy-of-needs">Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs</h2>
<p><img src="https://iamevan.me/images/posts/psych_safety_Untitled-2020-10-14-1331.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve said the word “safety” a lot there but I should probably explain what that means. In terms of safety when it comes to the workplace, I subscribe to the idea of Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs - which I first learned about back in secondary school.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you have a pyramid of requirements, where fulfilling each level requires you have fulfilled the level below it, until eventually you’ve reached the top level of “self-actualisation” which is this idealised view of achieving one’s full potential.</p>
<p>In reality, things aren’t <em>as</em> cut and dry and you can certainly achieve certain levels without having its predecessor fully solidified or secure but it’s a good mental model of understanding what people <em>need</em>. In terms of what I want to talk about, self-actualisation can also be viewed as “feeling safe”.</p>
<p>The hierarchy breaks itself down into 3 categories and 5 levels. I’m going to tackle them top-down.</p>
<p>At the top, we have the end goal of reaching our full, happy potential which is it’s own category of <strong>Self-Fulfillment Needs</strong>. That is, these are the things that drive us, professionally or creatively, and give us satisfaction in life.</p>
<p>To reach self-fulfillment, you need to have your <strong>Psychological Needs</strong> met. <em>Esteem Needs</em> covers things like respect and prestige in life or just a general feeling of accomplishment. This can come from regular reviews, praise and a feeling of responsibility in your work. And to fulfil your esteem needs, you need to have your <em>Love &amp; Belonging Needs</em>. These come from intimate or close relationships (romantic or platonic) and are born out of a sense of community and togetherness.</p>
<p>To reach your psychological needs, you need to have your <strong>Basic</strong> <strong>Needs</strong> met. Personal <em>Safety Needs</em> are things like your home as well as security in your job or financial status. These are things that give you predictability for the foreseeable future. Finally, to achieve all of the above you have to meet your <em>Physical Needs</em>. Things like food, warmth, water and sleep. All those pesky things you need to keep track of to keep living.</p>
<p>Maslow’s Hierarchy is important here because, although it may not be your job to meet these needs, if someone doesn’t have these building blocks then they are not going to feel totally safe in their work. For example, if someone’s working on a rolling monthly contract, they might be more worried about “am I going to be let go this month” rather than “is this code ready to deploy right now” as they hit the big red button and scurry off to make a comforting meal.</p>
<p>If you are in charge of a company, it’s important to reduce as much cognitive load on your employees as possible. If someone is anxious about setting up a pension or worried about moving next month or is having issues with a colleague, those are all things that will distract them from their job. You should be looking for ways to help people feel safe and happy in their work. From a capitalist point of view: happy people are more productive and more productivity means more money. Investing in your employees’ wellbeing (with opt-in offers, don’t force anything on people) will probably be a net benefit for you for many reasons.</p>
<p>What’s important for us right now, though, is that people who feel safer, act safer, concentrate more as they make and deploy things, and reduce failure significantly.</p>
<h2 id="the-toyota-kata-and-the-andon-cord"><strong>The Toyota Kata And The Andon Cord</strong></h2>
<p>I love talking to new teams about the story of the Andon Cord in the Toyota manufacturing factories in the late 1900’s cause it’s such a great example of 1) how to treat failure positively; and 2) how to reduce failure by empowering people and making them feel safe.</p>
<p>Between 1950 and 1990, Toyota’s factories added this physical rope, called the Andon Cord, that followed along the assembly line. If you pulled the cord, the manufacturing line would stop nearly immediately. Now, most people I’ve met start thinking that this is a safety switch - that in an emergency you can pull it to prevent harm - but it’s not!</p>
<p>Mike Rother authored a book called “Toyota Kata” which is where the West first learned about this concept (I think, don’t quote me on that) but what he says in that book is that the cord is a tool to install autonomic behaviour in the people on the assembly line. He called this “kata”. When someone pulled the cord , everything stopped and an “andon” (most commonly a flashing light) would light up above the workstation.</p>
<p>The team-lead for that section would then physically go to that station and see what the issue was. Toyota lives by a “Show Me” culture which aims to eliminate any of the bias related to the problem because both parties are present at the issue and can only work with the facts of what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Something very important to the psychological safety we’re discussing is that when the team-lead arrived, the first thing they always did was thank the team member for pulling the cord. This reinforced the feeling of safety; you were not judged for pulling the cord, it was <em>always</em> a good thing because it was <em>always a good thing</em> to prevent an issue or defect. You may have added time in the moment to the process but in the long-run, you were saving the company the money and time involved in processing the results of that defect.</p>
<p>No matter how small the issue or if the cord was tugged mistakenly, there were never any repercussions and it was always treated as a positive thing. Toyota, at their core, believed that failure created learning opportunities and that it wasn’t a negative thing.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://itrevolution.com/kata/">If you’d like to read more about the Toyota Kata, check out this great post by John Willis.</a></em></p>
<h2 id="making-failure-a-positive-experience"><strong>Making Failure A Positive Experience</strong></h2>
<p>The idea that we learn from failure is a tale as old as time but it’s a crucial part of psychological safety and my day-to-day job. Workplaces should feel <em>challenging</em> but not <em>threatening</em>. Modern teams' success often builds off the ability to take risks while still being vulnerable in front of our peers.</p>
<p>In Site Reliability Engineering, <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/">being Blameless</a> is a core tenet of our approach to learning from failure. We try to instill a culture where every “mistake” is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the overall team/project/system.</p>
<p>When something negative happens, there needs to be conversations afterwards about what can be learned from it and what can be improved. The best results will come from a team that feels safe enough to talk frankly about their shortcomings, the shortcomings of the company and the reality of a situation. Think of a situation where you made a change that cost your company a couple thousand euro in sales - in a psychologically <em>un</em>safe environment, there’s no way you’d put your hand up to admit what happened for fear of being demoted or fired. And without a clear understanding of everything that happened, how could you possibly talk about fixing this in the future?</p>
<p>Making failure a positive experience is a culture shift and it happens gradually, not all at once. Regardless of your position in a team, start by admitting your own mistakes. When you fail, give clear signals that it’s okay to fail and it’s okay to call you out when other people see you making mistakes in real time.</p>
<p>It’s important to encourage risk-taking in your teammates and to make room for growth. Not every idea is golden because sometimes initiatives fail and projects don’t turn out the way you imagined. It’s a good idea to take a moment at the end of a milestone of a project and have an honest discussion about the good things, the bad things and the things that could be improved in the future.</p>
<p>It might sound counterintuitive but you need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Being open and vulnerable will incur some level of discomfort with your peers, it’s inevitable. For example, you might be someone who likes control and relinquishing that control may make you uncomfortable, but giving others the space to try something new is the only way to figure out if that crazy idea is crazy enough that it just might work.</p>
<p>Acknowledge the discomfort in the moment but try to approach it as a collaborator, not as an adversary. You should all collectively work together towards understanding and volunteering for risk, so that when failure does happen, you have replaced <em>blame</em> with <em>curiosity</em>.</p>
<p>Creating psychological safety around failure encourages people to think about how things can be improved, rather than focusing on blame and how it happened.</p>

October 17, 2020 | https://dixonary.co.uk/blog/trustarc | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dixonary.co.uk/blog/trustarc">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TrustArc, a company which provides GDPR compliance systems, is in blatant violation of the GDPR.</p>
<p>TrustArc is one of many companies which provides the classic “Agree to cookies / More options” jumbotrons that litter the internet these days. You may be aware of the company under its former name, TRUSTe.</p>
<p><img src="https://dixonary.co.uk/static/images/trustarc/trustarc-notice-1.png"></p>
<p>Notice the “Powered by TrustArc” in the bottom-right corner. You’ll recognise the flavour of these cookie notices if you’ve been through more than one or two - though they take several different forms. Some have the little toggle switches, some have a different selection of buttons - presumably to make them feel differentiated from one another.</p>
<p>Now, if you look very closely at the cookie notice in the picture above, you may notice something a little suspicious. I only noticed this after committing to the blog post, so it’s not the main topic. See if you can spot it before looking at the picture below. (If you have JavaScript enabled, there’s a button to show it)</p>

<p><img src="https://dixonary.co.uk/static/images/trustarc/trustarc-notice-2.png"></p>

<p>Yes, that’s a cookie for Microsoft Advertising in the “necessary cookies” section. It’s possible that this is a simple mischaracterisation of a MS-powered login. However there’s also one or more for SiteImprove, which is a company that provides an analytics platform; again, described as a necessary cookie despite the domain literally having analytics in the name. Not much plausible deniability there, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>(In case you are wondering, this particular example is from LinkLaters, which officially hosts information about the incoming ePrivacy Regulation, due to replace the “cookie law” at some point in the near future. Ho hum.)</p>
<p><strong><em>But anyway</em></strong>, that wasn’t actually the point of this article. The point was to highlight a <em>different</em> way that TrustArc’s “GDPR compliance” is violating GDPR.</p>
<p>The relevant line in the summary of the cookie regulations is highlighted below.</p>
<p><img src="https://dixonary.co.uk/static/images/trustarc/gdpr-cookies.png"></p>
<p>TrustArc provide a very interesting service in relation to this last point (highlighted). On some websites, pressing the “save preferences” button will create a honest-to-god <em>pop-up window</em> of all things, which then sets a spinner going with a message “This may take up to a few minutes to process.”</p>
<p>Some sites embed this “processing preferences” window in a dialog box instead of a pop-up, meaning that you can’t go on to read the content until it has completed its little dance in its entirety.</p>
<p><img src="https://dixonary.co.uk/static/images/trustarc/trustarc-notice-3.png"></p>
<p>This is clearly intended as a trap for those less knowledgeable with computers. Anyone with an ounce of tech nouse will be aware that it does not take “up to a few minutes” to save this much information to a database. Indeed, taking more than a couple of milliseconds would be grounds to declare the entire development team incompetent; on the order of seconds to <em>minutes</em> takes us way past “incompetent” and deep into “overtly malicious” territory.</p>
<p>The result and the goal of this software is to make exercising your right to privacy <em>feel bad</em>. By adding these small bumps in the road, it makes giving up and hitting “accept all” into the path of least resistance for many people. This is entirely contradictory to the purpose of the Regulations that the EU has put in place, and should be treated as an act of contempt in the face of the legislation.</p>
<p>Of course, it will surprise nobody that the preference-saving charade takes <em>suspiciously</em> close to exactly 30 seconds to complete. Almost as if it were some kind of artificial delay…</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
<a href="https://twitter.com/TrustArc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span data-cites="TrustArc">@TrustArc</span></a> Why does your EUPreferenceManger consistenly take exactly 30 seconds to save my opt out cookie preferences? What is it doing? It's not waiting on the server, it doesn't send anything while applying the settings. Are you artificially adding delay so people don't opt out? <a href="https://t.co/gUx9EpbSgv">pic.twitter.com/gUx9EpbSgv</a>
</p>
— nota 🐙 (<span data-cites="NotAFile">@NotAFile</span>) <a href="https://twitter.com/NotAFile/status/970799125708066818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2018</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and what’s this? It doesn’t have the same delay when you simply decide to accept all cookies? How very shocking. And completely unintentional, I’m sure. u/PresentAppointment0 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/ijq1os/the_forbes_websites_cookie_consent_form_takes/">documents this behaviour on r/assholedesign</a>, but it’s very easy to go and test it for yourself.</p>
<p>So, why is this unlawful? The cookie law explicitly states that it must be <strong>as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give consent</strong>. Given the evidence above, it is entirely clear that withdrawing your consent for non-functional cookies is considerably more difficult than giving your consent. There are few examples more clear-cut.</p>
<p>Now, not all websites with cookie consent managers powered by TrustArc exhibit this behaviour (for example, LinkLaters, the site pictured at the top of the site did not - but Forbes and ProQuest are two examples which seem to invoke the delay). If anyone has access to the backend, I’d be interested to find out whether this is a per-site setting that clients can choose.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why TrustArc’s clients believe that this is a lawful move - possibly by some misinterpretation of the phrase “withdraw consent” based on an uncharitable reading of the regulations. Breach of cookie-related provisions of the regulation can result in fines of up to €10m or 2% of annual worldwide turnover. It’s unlikely that TrustArc would be liable directly, but any affected website would have a good chance in court recouping those expenses if TrustArc have claimed to provide regulatory compliance. Indeed, it may be the case that big businesses are using TrustArc as a scapegoat in order to continue their unsavoury practices in the light of day.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that someone sees through this long enough to actually act against them in court. In the meantime, I would strongly recommend that you avoid using any websites which employ TrustArc’s malicious code, and, if you have the spare time, contact the client companies that you care about to inform them that their parasitic, non-compliant, hostile practices are bad for business and consumer alike.</p>

<p>First of all, keep calm. Objections during sales calls can seem intimidating at first, especially when you’re not prepared for them.</p>



<p>The customer is interested in buying from you. Otherwise, they wouldn’t bring up the steep price, your experience level, or that they already use a competitor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they weren’t interested, they would have told you No right away.</p>



<p>Therefore, if they object in any way, acknowledge it and respond.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-objection-handling-strategy-ask-clarifying-questions">Objection Handling Strategy: Ask clarifying questions</h2>



<p>For instance, “Why do you think the price is too steep? What price did you have in mind?”</p>



<p>Questions open the mind. You keep the conversation going but also learn more about the underlying motives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you’re selling training and charge $2000, but the customer was planning to spend $500 at maximum, the perceived value is different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take a step back and explain why you think it’s worth $2000 or how this investment will repay.</p>



<h2 id="h-objection-handling-strategy-reply-with-a-statement">Objection Handling Strategy: Reply with a statement</h2>



<p>For instance, the customer has said something like, “Your consulting offer is interesting, but I’m not sure if it’ll yield results because you’re only in your early twenties.”</p>



<p>You counter with, “I’m in my early twenties. Therefore I have a different view on the world and provide you with strategies tailored toward Gen Y and Z.”</p>



<h2 id="h-objection-handling-strategy-prepare-responses">Objection Handling Strategy: Prepare responses</h2>



<p>The majority of objections from prospects and customers are very similar. Prospects may say things like:</p>



<p><em>👤&nbsp;“It’s too expensive.”</em></p>



<p><em>👤&nbsp;“You don’t seem to have enough experience.”</em></p>



<p><em>👤&nbsp;</em> <em>“We already use competitor X.”</em></p>



<p><em>👤&nbsp;</em> <em>“Why should I buy from you over X?”</em></p>



<p><em>…</em></p>



<p>When there’s so much repetition, you can prepare an answer and strategy for all of them. Whenever a prospect objects, collect them on your list, and after the call, come up with one or more responses.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Objection</strong></td><td><strong>Response</strong></td></tr><tr><td>It’s too expensive</td><td>Why do you think that way?You need to invest in your business</td></tr><tr><td>The cost is too high</td><td>It’s not a cost; it’s an investment. Let’s talk about why investing in your business is important</td></tr><tr><td>You don’t seem to have enough experience</td><td>I might not have the ten years of experience; on the other hand, I provide you with a fresh outside perspective on things.</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Prepare your responses to common sales objections</figcaption></figure>



<p>When a prospect could throw you off with objections before, now you’re projecting self-confidence because you know what to say.&nbsp;Additionally, an objection is not <a href="https://21-lessons.com/handling-objections-more-effectively-in-sales-conversations/">a definite No.</a> It’s a feeling or concern you need to address to clear the path for the sale.</p>



<p><br>Now I am curious to hear from you, how you will handle objections next time a customer brings them up in a call. </p>



<p>I’m supporting IT freelancers and tech companies with their sales strategies. If you need support with a custom objection strategy or any other sales topic, I’m looking forward to working together with you.

	Competition in the High-Performance Computing GPGPU market has emerged with GPGPUs from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel targeting future Exascale class systems.
	The new AMD Radeon Instinct MI50 hints at the capabilities of AMD’s future GPUs.
	</p>
	<p>
	This study takes a first look at the MI50 performance on characteristic scientific and machine learning applications.

<h3 id="the-poster">The Poster</h3>

<p><a href="https://emerging-architectures.github.io/amd_mi50_benchmarks/assets/images/poster.pdf"><img src="https://emerging-architectures.github.io/amd_mi50_benchmarks/assets/images/poster.png" alt="ISC-HPC 20 Poster"></a></p>



<p>We evaluated four reference systems representing a variety of modern consumer- and professional-grade hardware:</p>
<ol>
  <li>a <strong>GTX 1080Ti</strong> system with PCIe gen 3x16 GPU-GPU IC,</li>
  <li>a <strong>RTX 2080Ti</strong> system with no GPU-GPU communication,</li>
  <li>a <strong>Tesla V100</strong> system with NVLink, and</li>
  <li>a <strong>AMD Radeon Instinct MI50</strong> system with two xGMI hives.</li>
</ol>

<p>All systems are use the single-root, dual-socket SuperMicro SYS-4029GP-TRT2 system.
System details, diagrams, and benchmarking results can be found in the poster.</p>

<p>We ran two case studies that represent common workloads we run in our lab:
(a) a GPU-optimized rotating detonation engine simulation, and
(b) a compute-heavy deep learning training task.
Implementation and methodology details are described below.</p>

<h4 id="running-the-machine-learning-benchmarks">Running the Machine Learning Benchmarks</h4>

<p>Our machine learning benchmarks were run using TensorFlow 1.15 and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks">TensorFlow 1.x CNN benchmarks</a>.
While the tensorflow benchmarks are no longer updated for TensorFlow 2.x, they have been optimized for TensorFlow 1.15, making this a useful and replicable task for comparing GPGPU performance.</p>

<p>Because our tests are run on a single node, we use the default <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training">TensorFlow Distributed</a> MirrorStrategy with the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl">NCCL</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl">RCCL</a> all-reduce algorithm.</p>

<p>The benchmark task is training ResNet50-v1 on a synthetic ImageNet dataset using a momentum optimizer.
This compute-heavy task is characteristic of many other deep computer vision tasks with its dense image inputs and a deep, feed-forward, mostly convolutional architecture that translates well to GPGPUs.</p>

<h5 id="singularity-containers">Singularity Containers</h5>

<p>We used the HPC-oriented container platform <a href="https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/">Singularity</a> (v3.5.2) to manage our environment and dependencies for this study.
Singularity ≥3.5 is required for ROCm support.</p>

<p>All reported results were collected using official TensorFlow and ROCm images available on Docker Hub. Singularity images can be pulled with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>singularity pull docker://<span>$IMAGE_WITH_TAG</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can start a shell or run a script with:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># start a shell in the container environment w/ NVIDIA GPU access</span>
<span>$ </span>singularity shell <span>--nv</span> <span>$PATH_TO_SIMG</span>

<span># run a python script in the container environment w/ ROCm GPU access</span>
<span>$ </span>singularity <span>exec</span> <span>--rocm</span> <span>$PATH_TO_SIMG</span> python3 run.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following containers were used to collect reported results:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CUDA:</strong> <code>tensorflow/tensorflow:1.15.2-gpu-py3</code> (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/tensorflow/tensorflow/1.15.2-gpu-py3/images/sha256-da7b6c8a63bdafa77864e7e874664acfe939fdc140cb99940610c34b8c461cd0?context=explore">link</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>ROCm:</strong> <code>rocm/tensorflow:rocm3.1-tf1.15-dev</code> (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/rocm/tensorflow/rocm3.1-tf1.15-dev/images/sha256-21bad6c4225f92253fdcd5db4ba24ae850ee7b6e294cd23448ccd7288498f9b5?context=explore">link</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="training-throughput">Training Throughput</h5>

<p>We measured computational performance of each system using <strong>training images per second</strong>.</p>

<p>An iteration includes both forward and backward passes through the network.
We used the largest power-of-2 batch size that would fit in GPU memory: 64 images/device for the GTX and RTX systems (11gb) and 256 images/device for the V100 and MI50 systems (32gb).
We ran enough warm-up iterations for the training speed to appear stable (5 steps for the NVIDIA hardware and 100 steps for AMD hardware).
The final training throughput is the median of three runs with 500 steps each.</p>

<p>The following script will run ResNet50 training benchmarks on 1-8 GPUs.
Fill out the variables at the top (<code>container_path</code>, <code>gpu_flag</code>, and <code>batch_size</code>) based on your specific system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>container_path</span><span>=</span>...

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some other helpful environment variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code> and <code>HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code> control which GPUs are visible to TensorFlow.</li>
  <li><code>NCCL_DEBUG=INFO</code> will print out the GPU-GPU interconnects and NCCL ring topology used for the all-reduce operations, which is useful for verification purposes.</li>
  <li><code>NCCL_P2P_LEVEL</code> controls when to use direct GPU-to-GPU transport by setting the max allowable distance.
A value of 0 (or LOC) disables all P2P communications.</li>
  <li><code>TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2</code> will force XLA compilation, optimizing the graph for your given hardware.
This is particularly effective in mixed-precision mode when using GPUs with Tensor Cores.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html">Other NCCL flags</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other helpful benchmark options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>--trace_file=trace.json</code> will save a tfprof trace of your training process, averaged over the first 10 steps.
The results can be viewed at <code>chrome://tracing</code> in the Chrome browser.
This is useful for debugging distributed performance issues.</li>
  <li><code>--use_fp16</code> will run the training in mixed-precision mode.
This will use NVIDIA Tensor Cores on supported hardware.</li>
  <li>Full benchmark options can be listed with <code>python tf_cnn_benchmarks.py --helpfull</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="power-efficiency">Power Efficiency</h5>

<p>Performance per Watt is an extremely important metric when evaluating HPC systems.
This is often reported in FLOPS/W (Floating Point Operations per Second per Watt) using a benchmark such as LINPACK.
For this study, we use a practical machine learning analog: <strong>training images per second per Watt</strong>.</p>

<p>We approximate power consumption as</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Non-GPU:</strong> <em>Running Average Power Limit</em>, or <em>RAPL</em>, is an Intel processor feature that provides information on energy and power consumption of different physical domains.
Average power draw was collected using the powercap interface: we queried <code>energy_uj</code> once per second over a 1-minute interval of a given workload, calculating average power over each timestep pair.
Power data was collected over package-0 (core), package-1 (uncore), and the DRAM power plane.
This excludes GPU power draw, which was recorded separately.</p>

    <p>We collected our data using code modified from <a href="https://github.com/ColinIanKing/powerstat">the <code>powerstat</code> tool</a>.
Other utilities for accessing RAPL metrics include <code>perf</code>, <code>turbostat</code>, or <code>powertop</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GPU:</strong> Average GPU power draw was collected using the <code>nvidia-smi</code> and <code>rocm-smi</code> utilities.</p>

    <div><div><pre><code># For NVIDIA
timeout 60 nvidia-smi --query-gpu=timestamp,name,index,power.draw --format=csv --loop=1 -f $LOGFILE

# For ROCm
for i in {1..60}; do rocm-smi -P --json &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE; sleep 1; done
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>The power consumption measurements can be retrieved and averaged from these files.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The utility scripts that we used can be found <a href="#">here</a>.
To collect power information for different modes,
we started a training run as described in <a href="#training-throughput">Training Throughput</a>,
waited until iteration 10 of training,
then manually started the power consumption monitoring tools.</p>

    <p>This post aims to be a practical guide to pre-build and serve vector tiles
as static assets for interactive maps without the need for a dedicated server or a third-party service.</p>
<!-- If you are interested in knowing more about vector tiles, the different formats, etc
please check out [this post](/vector-map-tiles). -->
<p>If you’re in a hurry or you’d rather learn by example, here’s
<a href="https://github.com/roperzh/meteorites">the source code</a> for a
<a href="https://meteorites.monades.dev/">demo project</a> that implements everything explained
here.</p>

<p>Statically generated content (like this blog) comes with advantages both in
costs, resources, and security:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance: no server-side processing nor databases</li>
<li>Hosting: simple setup and zero to non-maintenance</li>
<li>Security: no server-side language issues to exploit and no database to hack</li>
</ul>
<p>However, pre-generating tiles also has limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t generate data on the fly based on user input.</li>
<li>Static tiles are better suited for maps that don’t change often, re-generating
a large number of tiles frequently can be a waste of time and resources.</li>
<li>You might need to put restrictions on the scales that a user can choose
(zoomed layers can generate a large number of tiles)</li>
</ul>
<p>Serving static content works in a fair amount of cases, but is not well
suited for everyone, and before moving forward it’s worth asking the question: will
it work for you?</p>
<h3 id="find-and-download-data"><a href="#find-and-download-data">Find and download data</a></h3>
<p>If you know what you need to display in the map, but you don’t have the data
yet, the next step is finding a good data source.</p>
<p>A web search is your best ally, but here’s an incomplete
list of sources with a wealth of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth Data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://data.nasa.gov/browse">NASA</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=5/51.500/-0.100">Open Street Map</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hub.arcgis.com/search">ArcGIS Hub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">USGS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before using the data, please make sure to comply to the terms of use and
attributions of each source.</p>
<h3 id="convert-your-data-to-geojson"><a href="#convert-your-data-to-geojson">Convert your data to GeoJSON</a></h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats#:~:text=A%20GIS%20file%20format%20is,or%20by%20GIS%20software%20developers#Vector_examples">different formats</a> to store Geographic information data but the tool
you’re going to use in the next step requires the input data to be in the GeoJSON
format.</p>
<p>To convert the data to GeoJSON you can use any online service or tool
of your choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://gdal.org/">GDAL</a> (<code>ogr2ogr</code>) is my tool of choice because it allows you to
convert practically between any format you can find in the wild. Once you have
<a href="https://gdal.org/download.html">installed it</a>, converting the data is a matter of running:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON source.geojson source.shp
</code></pre></div><h3 id="build-static-tiles"><a href="#build-static-tiles">Build static tiles</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe">tippecanoe</a> is a command line application that allows you to
generate vector tiles from GeoJSON files, it’s capable of generating:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single <code>.mbtiles</code> file (oversimplifying, think of tiles stored in a SQLite
container).</li>
<li>A folder hierarchy that contains <code>{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf</code> files with the tiles, where
<code>z</code> is the zoom level and <code>(x, y)</code> the coordinate of the tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file hierarchy is convenient to serve static tiles because clients commonly use URL structures in the form of <code>http://server.com/z/x/y.pbf</code> to request tiles.</p>
<p>The idea is roughly as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate an <code>.mbtiles</code> file for every layer of data that you want to show.
At this stage, you can adjust the placement and visibility of this layer at
different zoom levels.</li>
<li>Combine the <code>.mbtiles</code> files and generate the file hierarchy we described
above using the <code>tile-join</code> command (included when you install tippecanoe)</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Generate a .mbtiles file for every layer you want to display</span>
<span># this shows countries at low zoom levels but states at higher zoom levels:</span>
tippecanoe --exclude-all -z3 -o countries-z3.mbtiles --coalesce-densest-as-needed countries.geojson
tippecanoe -zg -Z4 -o states-Z4.mbtiles --coalesce-densest-as-needed --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping states.geojson

<span># Join the generated files and Create a nested directory of tiles</span>
tile-join -e tiles countries-z3.mbtiles states-Z4.mbtiles
</code></pre></div><p>Don’t let the flags threaten you, <code>tippecanoe</code>'s README contains a
<a href="https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe#cookbook">cookbook</a> with examples, chances are you will find
something useful there.</p>
<p>This step will vary from project to project depending on what information you
need to display.</p>
<h3 id="add-necessary-metadata"><a href="#add-necessary-metadata">Add necessary metadata</a></h3>
<p>Along with the tiles, <code>tippecanoe</code> generates a <code>metadata.json</code> with
information about the tiles and the layers used to generate them.</p>
<p>The client consuming the tiles uses this file later on, but for it to be usable
you need to do some cleanup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the URL in which you’re going to host your tiles.</li>
<li>Convert the string value of the <code>vector_layers</code> key into JSON.</li>
<li>Delete the <code>json</code> property.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can do this manually, or with a bit of glue code, here’s a bit of
JavaScript, feel free to borrow, modify and use it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>metadata</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"./tiles/metadata.json"</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>writeFileSync</span><span>,</span> <span>copyFileSync</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"fs"</span><span>);</span>

</span><span></span><span>copyFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>"./tiles/metadata.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>"./tiles/metadata.backup.json"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// convert the `vector_layers` key from a string to JSON

<span>// Set the tiles key
</span><span></span><span>metadata</span><span>.</span><span>tiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"https://your-domain.com/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf"</span><span>];</span>

<span>// Remove the `json` key to prevent errors
</span><span></span><span>delete</span> <span>metadata</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Write the updated file
</span><span></span><span>writeFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>"./tiles/metadata.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>metadata</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="host-the-tiles"><a href="#host-the-tiles">Host the tiles</a></h3>
<!-- Choosing where to host the tiles is entirely up to you, there's a
[guide](/hosting-aws) on this site for hosting static tiles in Amazon S3, but
here are some recommendations:
-->
<p>Choosing where to host the tiles is entirely up to you, as it will depend on
your infrastructure, but here are some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tippecanoe</code> exports gzipped <code>.pbf</code> files by default, make sure to set the <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> header or to generate uncompressed tiles by adding the flag <code>--no-tile-compression</code></li>
<li>Make sure to upload the <code>metadata.json</code> file in the root of the <code>tiles</code>
folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="add-styles"><a href="#add-styles">Add styles</a></h3>
<p>From the MapBox <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Mapbox style is a document that defines the visual appearance of a map: what
data to draw, the order to draw it in, and how to style the data when drawing
it. A style document is a JSON object with specific root level and nested
properties. This specification defines and describes these properties.</p>

<p>It’s important to highlight that despite what the word ‘styles’ might suggest,
this JSON document also indicates <em>what data to draw</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to start from scratch to keep things light, here is
base template you can use:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Key points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>vector</code> source named <code>tiles</code> with the URL hosting the generated vector
tiles points to the <code>metadata.json</code> file.</li>
<li>The display of different layers is managed via the <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/layers/"><code>layers</code>
property</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The style document can be as complex or as simple as your application needs, and
can include <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/expressions/">expressions</a> to compute the value for
different attributes.</p>
<h3 id="consume-your-tiles"><a href="#consume-your-tiles">Consume your tiles</a></h3>
<p>The final step of the puzzle is to consume your vector tiles with a client
library, from plugins for the popular <a href="https://leafletjs.com/"><code>Leaflet</code></a>, to native clients.</p>
<p>The people at MapBox keep an updated list at <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles">github.com/awesome-vector-tiles</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose will depend on your needs, but just so you have a
reference, consuming the generated tiles using <code>mapbox-gl-js</code> is as simple as
providing a link to your <code>style</code>s when instantiating a new map:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>new</span> <span>Mapbox</span><span>({</span>
  <span>container</span><span>:</span> <span>"map"</span><span>,</span>

          <section>
            
<div>
<p>If you have a website, you are likely using some kind of analytics to track visits. According to several reports like <b><a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics#:~:text=Google%20Analytics%20is%20used%20by,extensive%20Google%20Analytics%20market%20report." target="_blank">this one</a>﻿</b>, Google Analytics is currently used by up to&nbsp;<b>85%</b> of ALL&nbsp;websites in the Internet that use known analytics services and software. Let that sink in:&nbsp;85%. It's a massive market share that simply blows any competition out of the water. Personally, I have been thinking of ditching all things Google for a while due to privacy concerns - like many other people. However, I gave up on this idea for now because I rely on too many Google products that simply don't have alternatives available which are as good. Privacy concerns aside, these days Google Analytics isn't great from an accuracy point of view, because an increasing number of users use ad blockers or browsers with ad blockers built in, and despite the name these block various types of trackers including Google Analytics, besides ads. This means that Google Analytics tends to show much lower figures for metrics such as users and page views compared to other analytics solutions that allow you to use custom domains, which ad blockers don't recognize and thus ignore.<false></false></p>
<p>As for privacy concerns, there are many analytics options that claim to be privacy friendly, in that they do not collect any personally identifiable information and therefore are also GDPR&nbsp;compliant.</p>
<p>I have tried some of these services, such as <b><a href="https://usefathom.com/" target="_blank">Fathom</a>﻿</b> and&nbsp;<b><a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_blank">Plausible</a>﻿</b>, but I then switched to self-hosted <b><a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank">Umami</a>﻿</b>, a young project that replicates the same features - including privacy friendliness - but for free if you have some server where you can install it very easily and quickly. One thing I&nbsp;like of these solutions is that they show all the most important metrics on a single page, so they don't require a PhD in order to use them. No countless menus and reports. Just one page with top visited pages, traffic sources, countries and little more.</p>
<p>However I have never stopped using Google Analytics at the same time, because some of the many features it offers can be very handy both for SEO&nbsp;purposes by itself or due to the integration with other tools (I am currently trying to learn more on the subject) as well as the integration with Google Ads which for many companies are a necessary evil.</p>
<p>So, provided that we want/have to stick with Google Analytics for a reason or another, what can we do to improve accuracy?</p>
<p>Today I came across <b><a href="https://github.com/ZitRos/save-analytics-from-content-blockers" target="_blank">this project on Github</a>﻿</b> that basically allows you to use a Node based application to proxy all the requests to some Google&nbsp;properties (as well as a few non-Google ones) including Google Analytics, using your custom domain. Like I mentioned earlier, ad blockers ignore domains that they don't recognize as belonging to ad networks or other trackers.</p>
<p>Once you install the app - I use the Docker version in Kubernetes - you can just change your Google Analytics code snippet so that it looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://&lt;your custom domain&gt;/*(d3d3Lmdvb2dsZXRhZ21hbmFnZXIuY29t)*/*(Z3RhZw)*/*(anM)*?id=G-7C6FWHXCTH"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', '&lt;your  analytics property ID&gt;');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! It's as simple as that. You just need to change the URL&nbsp;of the Google Analytics/Tag Manager script with a URL&nbsp;that points to the custom domain you use for the proxy, having as the path the&nbsp;<i>www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js</i> part "masked" (you can see the simple npm command to mask the URL&nbsp;in the repo's README), and you're done. So instead of <i>https:///www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js</i> you would have a URL&nbsp;that looks like the one in the snippet above.&nbsp;Now all the requests to Google Analytics will be proxied through your custom domain and will be ignored by ad blockers altogether.<false></false></p>
<p>One downside of this approach is that out of the box if you have configured Google Analytics to exclude visits from specific IP addresses, the filters will stop working. This is because the proxy sends a parameter to Google to set the correct IP of the visitor to your website, otherwise Google will see the IP of the proxy and will be unable to determine the location of the visitor. The reason why the IP filters no longer work is that Google anonymizes the IPs specified by the proxy before comparing them with the IPs in the filters, so the IPs won't match and Google will ignore the filters and track the visits as usual.</p>
<p>Luckily there is an easy work-around for this:&nbsp;just change your filters in Google Analytics replacing the last octet of the IPs you want to exclude from the tracking with simply a zero, because that's what Google does to anonymize the IPs. So if the IP of the visitor is 123.123.123.123, it becomes 123.123.123.0 in the filter. I have been testing this for a few hours and filters seem to work again.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on the stats from Google Analytics over the next few days and compare them to those of Umami, but I can already see a difference in the visits tracked, because the figures between GA and Umami seem to be the same now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll see, but this seems to be solid and simple solution to improve the accuracy of Google Analytics. Also, if you prefer a hosted solution for this over self hosting it, the author of the project is working on a SaaS for it at&nbsp;<a href="https://dataunlocker.com/" target="_blank">https://dataunlocker.com/</a>&nbsp;which is reasonably priced and would make things even easier. I might purchase the service later. For now I am happy with the self hosted option.</p>

The answer is a frustrating.. <strong><em>sort of</em></strong>.</p><p id="253f">iPads, which is to say <em>any</em> iPad made in the last three years (<em>yes, even the base models</em>) has more than enough power to run development tools and compile most codebases you would care to. The more recent iPad Pro models even give modern Core i9 laptops a run for their money in some metrics.</p><p id="0892">Why then do we not see development tools on the iPad? Or at least, why do we not see more of the development tools we’re used to seeing on the platform. The reason, unfortunately, is iPadOS.</p><p id="742a">Where development machines typically run what we’ve come to think of as general purpose operating systems (the big three of which being Windows, macOS and Linux), iPads are significantly different.</p><p id="5d09">iPadOS applications are strictly sandboxed, meaning that these devices (<em>much like iPhones</em>) are prevented from executing arbitrary code. There are genuinely good reasons for this. Having this kind of strictly policed environment prevents a great many security threats that have plagued less strongly opinionated platforms for years. Unfortunately it’s also for this exact reason that the iPad is not, and cannot in it’s current form, make a truly useful or pleasant development machine.</p><p id="b7bc">There are workarounds of course. Some folks have had success with buying an additional device (<em>usually a Raspberry Pi</em>) and connecting to that to edit and build their code. Others are quite happy to connect to a remote server and edit their code in Safari. These are solutions that may work for some people, but fundamentally you aren’t able to just take an iPad and start coding freely without another device, because of the sandbox.</p><blockquote><p id="da00">Even if you get Visual Studio Code, or IDEA, or a new iPadOS-specific native editor that you’ve developed running on the iPad, you still have no way to run arbitrary code.</p></blockquote><p id="1b82">I’ve looked at how one might solve this problem within the confines of the iPad’s security policy. I’ve looked at what might be involved in running Visual Studio Code directly in a WKWebView panel (<em>and pursued this enough to be satisfied that it can definitely be done — although several Electron calls would need to be re-implemented</em>). Unfortunately, this line of thinking always falls down in the same place. Even if you get Visual Studio Code, or IDEA, or a new iPadOS-specific native editor that you’ve developed running on the iPad, you still have no way to run arbitrary code.</p><p id="0c7e">There are some tools available that come <em>so close</em> to realizing this goal. <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/" rel="noopener">Pythonista</a> is an example of a tool that pushes right up to the edge of the iPad’s restrictions — and allows for writing and debugging Python code within the application’s folder and with the understanding that external tools and native code can’t be executed.</p><p id="4a1f">But for arbitrarily and freely developing code in a language of the user’s choice? No dice.</p><p id="5bd6">Apple have their reasons for keeping the sandbox as it is. They’re not about to roll back these policies to appease a relatively small subset of their users — but I’m also not convinced they have to.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1930/1*sxW1lWdRgpOarSmjIwZAmA.png" width="965" height="452" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*sxW1lWdRgpOarSmjIwZAmA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*sxW1lWdRgpOarSmjIwZAmA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*sxW1lWdRgpOarSmjIwZAmA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*sxW1lWdRgpOarSmjIwZAmA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*sxW1lWdRgpOarSmjIwZAmA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>When life gives you sandboxes, build sandcastles! (Image © Courtney Hall)</figcaption></figure><p id="1f29">If iPadOS were to include a Terminal application for developers, the user could be allowed to execute arbitrary code <strong><em>that is still sandboxed and subject to the Terminal application’s own granted permissions. </em></strong>In so doing, the security stack is largely preserved, in that the Terminal application cannot access the filesystem outside of its own directory, but most of the roadblocks for developers go away.</p><p id="e7b4">While this would inevitably raise concerns, macOS’ Terminal application deploys this same principle to good effect already. The code executed inside Terminal on macOS still requires permissions to be granted to the Terminal application by the user, but any commands subsequently executed by tools that Terminal runs are treated as coming directly from Terminal by the permission system.</p><p id="e1f8">Providing this feature wouldn’t enable the free side-loading of arbitrary applications that larger compromises on the security system would entail, and there isn’t a risk to the App Store of people freely distributing applications for use via the Terminal app as this code wouldn’t be in the form of iPhone applications that exist with an interface (<em>or even in their own application context</em>) at all.</p><p id="eedf">All this would allow is the compiling and running of limited code in a command-line environment that an iPad application could interact with. That’s all most simple code editors really need to be for most users.</p><p id="e9a2">The outcome of this would be enabling developers, and those who want to be, to use their device for learning new skills and <strong><em>helping people do their jobs with their own devices</em></strong>, which is kind of what’s implied when you’re selling many of these devices with the word “Pro” printed in large letters on the box.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

    <p>Serverless side rendering. What a buzz word salad.</p>

    <p>So what does it mean? Well, put simply, it means we render your website without the need for a server. This is not a new idea - and while we happen to use serverless technology to do it - this concept has been around in various (albeit somewhat hard-to-use) forms for years now. The idea is simple: take some HTML, JS, and CSS - and find a way represent what it might look like if someone loaded it in a regular web browser, so that web crawlers, robots, and most importantly, your users, see rich content as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>And of course - this is why we have Vercel, Netlify, Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt, and the slew of other hybrid or server-side generated solutions. All fantastic, but all come with one very important addendum: you have to build your project *their* way.</p>

    <div>
      <div id="how_it_works">
      <div>
  <div>
    
    <p>
      Host your web-app assets anywhere
    </p>
    <p>
      Netlify, AWS, Firebase, Herokuâ€”doesn't matter.
    </p>
</div>

  <div>
    
    <p>
      Point your renderer at hosted assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Render your javascript in a browser and save your static HTML.
    </p>
</div>

  <div>
    
    <p>
      Route your domain to your renderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When any client loads your site, the HTML data will be returned to crawlers!
    </p>
</div>

  </div>
</div>

    </div>

    <p>Call us old fashioned, but we don't like to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. The browser is the most widely distributed application runtime on the planet; and it's our point of view that you should be able to build your website exactly how you please. If it works in the browser, it should work anywhere.</p>

    <p>That's what Spirit Fish is here to do. Build your project with any tools, and deploy it anywhere. Tell us where it's hosted, and then point your domain at our CDN. When a new request comes in, we'll spin up your site in a headless browser, take a snapshot, and stash it in our CDN for the next user. Of course, there's all sorts of advanced things you can do with it, but really, that's it!</p>

    <p>We built Spirit Fish to be as low touch to your project as possible, because we believe in a world where we don't need to run a fleet of servers to serve a React app, or spend hours waiting for rebuilds when a single piece of content changes, just to show our users a social share card.</p>

    <p>Spirit Fish is free to try, and each renderer comes with a generous free tier that should cover most hobby projects.

				<div>
					<p>My sister Sana just wanted to earn some money before returning to college. She was looking for a covid-friendly job on craigslist, something to cut down on the student loans she'd have to take out for the year. After searching and scrounging, Sana found someone who needed logistical help taking care of their pets. She applied and was excited to get hired.</p><p>First, they needed help buying pet food. They had ordered $1,800 worth of pet food (they bought high quality stuff in bulk apparently) but the seller would only accept payments via Zelle. Her employer was a bit old fashioned and didn't know how to use that service, so they offered a different arrangement: “I’ll mail you a check for $2,000” they said, “please deposit it in your own bank account, and then use $1,800 of it to Zelle the payment to the sellers. The remaining $200 is your fee.”</p><p>Sana was a bit suspicious, but she deposited the check into her Chase bank account and it cleared a few days later. Chase’s site showed that the money had been deposited successfully and was available to use, no strings attached. </p><p>Seemed like it was legit. So she did the honest thing and Zelle'd the money &nbsp;to the seller.</p><p>Happy with the job well done, her "employer" sent her another $2,000 check to deposit and transfer. This person really liked their pets. The same process happened again, and her employer was happy with the job well done.</p><p>Two weeks later, Sana’s debit card stopped working. Confused, she checked her account to see what was wrong. </p><p>Her heart sank. </p><p>Chase showed it as overdrawn.</p><p>By more than three thousand dollars.</p><p>The checks had bounced, two weeks after Chase’s site had indicated they had “cleared”. Before this whole thing had started, Sana had $300 in her bank account. Now she had negative $3,300.</p><p>She had just been scammed out of $3,600.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2><p>Turns out checks can bounce weeks after they're deposited. It can take that long for the bank to verify they’re legitimate.</p><p>Why does it take so long? Here’s a peek behind the scenes:</p><ol><li>You deposit your check, and it shows up as pending in your account.</li><li>Your bank sends the check to the check-writer’s bank to request the funds.</li><li>Their bank verifies if the check is legitimate and the account actually contains the funds. At small or international banks this step is often manual and could take <em>weeks</em>.</li><li>Their bank lets your bank know it's legit. That's when the check has "cleared".</li></ol><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 1600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The life cycle of a check</figcaption></figure><p>I skipped one step though: </p><p>It take can than more than <strong>six months</strong> for a check to clear, but banks remove that “pending” status just a couple days after it's deposited and allow people to spend the money. This might sound a bit iffy, but it's actually a good thing. Most checks are legitimate and people might need the money quickly. But that assumption breaks down with fraudulent checks.</p><p>By removing the “pending” status before fully verifying the check’s legitimacy, Chase gave the illusion that the check had already cleared. <em>This is what the scammers count on.</em> &nbsp;</p><p>Today there is <em>no way</em> for a Chase customer to be sure that a check has fully cleared. But unless you have the inside scoop on how banks work, or a finely honed sense of when someone is trying to swindle you, you won’t catch it.</p><p>When Sana called up Chase, the bank heard her out. But instead of stopping the scammers, their only concern was making sure she pays up the remaining $3,000 that they claimed she owed them.</p><p><em>Edit: Chase customer support had one clarification to make. I'd originally said it might take weeks for the check to clear, but they explained it could actually take more than six months. And you'll have no idea when that magic moment occurs.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg 828w" sizes="(min-width: 525px) 525px"></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="and-she-s-not-the-only-one-who-s-been-hit-by-this-scam-">And she's not the only one who's been hit by this scam.</h2><p>My friend David Vargas was caught by <a href="https://davidvargas.me/blog/i-got-scammed-out-of-5k/">pretty much the exact same scam</a>.

Of course not. Did they create an environment where scammers could thrive? Absolutely.</p><p>The harm was unintentional, but they played a hand in it. </p><p>Involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>What have other companies done when someone abused their products to deliberately cause harm? They took responsibility for it and fixed the problem at a systematic level.</p><p><strong>The Tylenol murders: </strong>In 1982, someone started <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/tylenol-murders-1982">spiking bottles of Tylenol</a> with poison, killing seven people. This was clearly not Tylenol’s fault, but they still immediately paid to recalled all bottles in the stores, offered anyone who had already purchased the pills free replacements. They took it a step further and <strong>developed tamper-proof packaging </strong>to prevent anyone from contaminating the medicine again in the future.</p><p><strong>Credit Card fraud services</strong>: Online payments are inherently risky. Credit card companies know this, and they’ve committed to helping their customers when the inevitable fraud occurs. If you pay someone with your Discover card and the product turns out to be a scam, <em>Discover will accept responsibility and refund you the money</em>, taking a loss if necessary. This dynamic keeps Discover on their toes working to prevent scams before they even happen.</p><h3 id="-2-how-should-they-fix-it">#2 How should they fix it?</h3><p>Make the status of the deposited check abundantly clear. This is how Chase can tamper-proof their bottles.</p><p>If a check has been deposited but not fully cleared, if it hasn't had the actual funds transferred over to the bank, then Chase needs to make that fact clear to customers! This missing piece of UX is what scammers depend on. That’s the systemic flaw here.</p><p>If the bank actually made the status of the funds clear to its customers, then it would have a much stronger leg to stand on when claiming innocence.</p><p>But as things stand right now, the only way a person could know the check was still at risk is if they already knew about the long clearing time and how banks hide it. Before the results come back from the external bank, Chase itself doesn’t know if the check is valid. Yet they offer customers no hint of that uncertainty.</p><p>And instead of taking responsibility, what did Chase actually do?</p><h3 id="chase-took-option-3-shakedown-their-customers">Chase took option #3: Shakedown their customers</h3><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 1192w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Chase acted like the mafia, shaking down whoever they could to get their money back.</p><p>My sister had created this bank account back when she was in high school.

My sincerest thank you to everyone who helps.</p><p>So far, Chase hasn’t been interested in accepting an ounce of responsibility for their part in this scheme.

				<p>You are reading about Flutter. You get excited that you can express yourself and create so much so quickly if what it promises is true. You give it a try. It's indeed a pleasure to develop and you can see your changes without a reload! You think you must create an app to give it a go.</p><p>But wait. You've only read about widgets and how to draw things on the screen. Where is your business logic going to live? Next to the UI building logic?</p><p>Flutter is quite opinionated on how to draw things on the screen but leaves how to organize state management and business logic to you. The Flutter community came up with <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options">various ways</a> to do state management. I will focus on the most simple yet scalable way (that is <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple">officially recommended</a>): the <code>provider</code> way.</p><p>There are plenty of great resources about the Provider state management. This post aims to give you an intro into the state management method as quickly as possible. It's a bit more concise than a tutorial and a bit more verbose than a cheat sheet.</p><h2 id="high-level-overview">High-level overview</h2><p>To make Flutter redraw the screen you need to call <code>setState()</code>. But this is not very convenient for a sizable app, especially when changes happen deep down in the widget hierarchy. </p><p>Provider offers a way for (stateful) widgets to get notified when a change happens in the view model that requires a call to <code>build()</code> to redraw the UI.</p><h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2><p>Head to your <code>pubspec.yaml</code> and add a dependency to the <code>provider</code> package (check <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider">pub.dev</a> for the latest version).</p><pre><code>dependencies:
  provider: ^4.3.2+2
  [...]</code></pre><h2 id="view-model">View Model</h2><p>This is where your "business logic" will live. Whatever is not related to how things will be drawn on the screen, should live here. </p><p>This class will extend <code>ChangeNotifier</code>. It's a kind of an Observable interface if you are familiar with the term. This allows the view model to notify the view when things have changed and a redraw is needed. This "notification" happens with the <code>notifyListeners()</code> call.</p><figure><pre><code>import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

class MyHomePageViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
    String text = 'Initial text';
    
    void onClicked() {

<div data-style="">

<p>This is a build log of my controlmylights project.</p>
<p><span>Note: I worked on multiple different parts of this project at different times. It may seem a bit disjointed but I can assure you it is in chronological order.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This project was inspired by the 2014 Twitch Plays Pokemon project. Twitch chat controlled Ash in his quest to “Catch Them All”. Also, I was gifted 2 4-foot lengths of Flexfire RGB LEDs and had been looking for a project in which to showcase them.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_2551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2551"><a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Twitch_plays_pokemon_animated.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Twitch_plays_pokemon_animated.gif" alt="" width="460" height="262"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2551">By Source (WP:NFCC#4), Fair use, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=42011048</figcaption></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.flexfireleds.com/colorbright-300-led-rgb-16ft-reel-color-changing-led-strip-light/"><img loading="lazy" role="img" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/flexfire_linear_logo_white_background_1574267960__82912.svg" alt="flexfire_linear_logo_white_background_1574267960__82912" width="456" height="89"></a></p>





<p><span>When I started work on this project, COVID-19 just started to lockdown the US and I saw, first-hand, the effects it had on non-profits. Non-profits have had their funding slashed from individual donations being down to government backed grants being cut due to major budget cuts. I wanted to create a different way of marketing to raise money for them. Also, during COVID I needed a way to learn new technologies and, hopefully, get a job.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span>The project began very simply as a single file in NodeJS, using the TMI.JS library to retrieve Twitch chats. Using Twitch’s is fairly simple with the help of TMI. It’s a websocket based API, so I didn’t have to worry about polling. Early on in this process I knew I wanted to build in analytics, so I could do some deep dive videos on it after the fact. For this I went with MongoDB, because my schema was still changing daily and I didn’t want to deal with the schema issues of SQL tables.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>By May, I had settled on a stack for the part of the program that ran on my desktop (it changed after this). The stack was NodeJS, Express, SocketIO, and MongoDB. Normally these stacks make up an interesting name, mine did not.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>By May I knew I wanted to break up the project into components or loosely coupled classes that would allow as many data inputs as I wanted and as many outputs. To do this I initially used ExpressJS and SocketIO to build a router to push data around my system. I now know Express is one of the slowest web servers for NodeJS and is not made for this. I had it setup to accept a Post request to the “</span><span>sendcolordata”</span><span> endpoint running on my machine. The internal components, like the eventual MongoDB component and Arduino component, would connect to the SocketIO server running on the “internalcolordata” room. Going with this architecture, Message Oriented Middleware, allowed me to build individual components like a website to control it, and easily test each component. Another benefit to this architecture was it allowed the files to act as microservices, so if the Twitch component failed or the Mongo component failed, the whole program would stay up. </span><span>This also allowed me to implement a queue system, initially using Bull, later Redis for color commands. </span></p>
</div>
<p>For half of the project this was the network architecture:<a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-Arduino-Component-Stage-Architecture.png"><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-Arduino-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png" alt="" width="1024" height="724" srcset="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-Arduino-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png 1024w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-Arduino-Component-Stage-Architecture-300x212.png 300w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-Arduino-Component-Stage-Architecture-768x543.png 768w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-Arduino-Component-Stage-Architecture-1536x1086.png 1536w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-Arduino-Component-Stage-Architecture-2048x1448.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Then this: <a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-Redis-New-Arch-Stage-Architecture.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-Redis-New-Arch-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png" alt="" width="1024" height="724" srcset="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-Redis-New-Arch-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png 1024w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-Redis-New-Arch-Stage-Architecture-300x212.png 300w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-Redis-New-Arch-Stage-Architecture-768x543.png 768w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-Redis-New-Arch-Stage-Architecture-1536x1086.png 1536w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-Redis-New-Arch-Stage-Architecture-2048x1448.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<div data-style="">
<p>Eventually this was the final architecture (made with Draw.io):</p>

<p><a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finaldrsawionetwork.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finaldrsawionetwork-1024x446.png" alt="Final network architecture for Control My Lights " width="1024" height="446" srcset="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finaldrsawionetwork-1024x446.png 1024w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finaldrsawionetwork-300x131.png 300w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finaldrsawionetwork-768x335.png 768w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finaldrsawionetwork-1536x670.png 1536w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/finaldrsawionetwork-2048x893.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>

</div>
<div data-style="">


<p><span>A Twitch Bot is a program that hangs out in your Twitch chat waiting for a command whether that be deleting spam comments or responding to someone asking how long you’ve been streaming. In my case, it was going to listen for color commands.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 id="Buildingthecolorcommands"><span>Building the color commands:</span></h3>
<p><span>I wanted people to be able to easily change the colors of the lights. After trying to find a Pantone color list with hex values, I moved onto a well known list of colors: HTML Web Safe colors (I modified <a href="https://github.com/radiovisual/html-colors/blob/master/html-colors.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> list). Using this list allowed me to have a nice hex color code reference for all of the named colors.&nbsp; Example: <span>Chartreuse is #7fff00.</span> In order to easily decipher between normal chat and a color command I went with a text format I’ve seen used of adding an “!” before the command. I also wanted to give the user a choice of a custom color, so I also added “#” to signify a custom hex color. This basis around hex would become the core of the application.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="TwitchMessages"><span>Messages:&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>Building the Twitch bot was straight forward using the TMI library. I checked if the message started with a “!” or “#”, then checked if the “!” command was in my list of colors, if not the program moves on. If the command starts with a “#” the program checks it is a valid hex.</span> &nbsp; <span>Once this was working, I built out a class to send data internally, and used it to send data to the Express Server. At this point, I decided to establish a data schema that would persist throughout the application and hashing using MD5 usernames, so I could determine the number of unique users while not storing their names.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Schema: </span><span>source, msgUsername, validColor, hex, “#HEXVALUE”. </span>&nbsp;<span>Eventually this would be updated to: </span></p>
<p><span>{</span> <span>source: source,</span> <span>username: MD5(“username”),</span> <span>validColor: True/False,</span> <span>hex: True/False,</span> <span>color:&nbsp; ‘#000000”,</span> <span>red: RedValue,</span> <span>green:&nbsp; GreenValue,</span> <span>blue:&nbsp; BlueValue</span> <span>dateTime: new Date()</span> <span>&nbsp; };</span> &nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="TwitchArchitectureStatus"><span>Architecture Status:</span></h3>
<p><span>At this point, the local Express server is sending the color messages it received to a MongoDb database directly. I knew this would become an issue but moved onto the website component.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Twitch-Component-Stage-Architecture.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Twitch-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png" alt="Twitch component sending data to Express web server" width="1024" height="724" srcset="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Twitch-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png 1024w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Twitch-Component-Stage-Architecture-300x212.png 300w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Twitch-Component-Stage-Architecture-768x543.png 768w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Twitch-Component-Stage-Architecture-1536x1086.png 1536w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Twitch-Component-Stage-Architecture-2048x1448.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>

</div>
<div data-style="">

<h3 id="Initialwebsitedevelopment"><span>Initial website development</span></h3>
<p><span>In addition to Twitch I wanted to have a website to allow users who don’t have a Twitch account to be able to interact with the project. To get started with this, I started making the project on Glitch.com, a site that lets you easily host your NodeJS site and edit it in the browser. I started with a proof of concept site:</span> &nbsp; <span>The quick color choices were manually-created form buttons, and the color picker was made using “a-color-picker”. Once I got the buttons and color picker sending data to the backend server via a POST request to the “colorsubmit” endpoint, I implemented some security measures: CORs, origin checks and input validation. The website blocks POST requests made to it from outside sources. After receiving the data successfully I needed to send it to my computer. I did this using the library SocketIO, a websocket implementation, to make dealing with websockets easier. To secure the socket I passed it a key from my desktop client and checked for a match.&nbsp;</span> <span>At this point the project architecture looks like this:&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oldSite.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oldSite-1024x759.png" alt="old site for Control My Lights" width="1024" height="759" srcset="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oldSite-1024x759.png 1024w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oldSite-300x222.png 300w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oldSite-768x569.png 768w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oldSite.png 1241w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<h3 id="Makingabetterwebsite"><span>Making a better website:&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<span>After learning how to implement SocketIO on Express for the web server, I implemented it into my localhost program. I pushed the data to a local SocketIO room, and created a MongoDB listener for it that inserted the data being sent to a database.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp; <span>After working on the internals of the program more, I moved back to working on the website with the goal of redesigning it and learning ReactJS along the way. I created a mockup of the site in Figma:&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>This was my first time using ReactJS and, while it’s different, I liked it. It was interesting to be able to turn every part of my site into a component. Because of ReactJS, I was able to generate color submit buttons for each of the colors my app uses, instead of having to manually create them. For the styling of the site I used Bootstrap v5. I also moved to a new color picker library that was mobile compatible, “Pickr”. Next I moved to hosting the site on Heroku and setting up a simple build script for the site, so ExpressJS would serve as a static version of the site.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="WebsiteArchitectureStatus"><span>The architecture now looks like this:&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</h3>

<p><a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-Website-Component-Stage-Architecture.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-Website-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png" alt="2 - Website Component Stage Architecture" width="1024" height="724" srcset="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-Website-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png 1024w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-Website-Component-Stage-Architecture-300x212.png 300w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-Website-Component-Stage-Architecture-768x543.png 768w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-Website-Component-Stage-Architecture-1536x1086.png 1536w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-Website-Component-Stage-Architecture-2048x1448.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>

</div>
<div data-style="">

<p><span>Another data source I wanted was YouTube chat, but found a big issue with it. You are only given 10,000 credits to use on the API for every 24 hours. With each read of the polling based API (not a modern real-time streaming API like Twitch) it costs 1 credit. After running the numbers I would burn through that API limit in ~2.5 hours. So I moved to using Selenium with Chrome webdriver to load the chat data. This posed some issues that can be read about <a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/2020/09/29/using-web-scraping-instead-of-the-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The best part about this method is it loads the site once, queries the DOM elements, and streams the data to my internal router. All of the hashing of usernames that happens on the Twitch Bot happens here, as well*. Also, due to Python using “False” for boolean false which differs from JavaScripts “false”, I had to add code on the NodeJS side to deal with this. * Note this would change dramatically by the end of the program. The hashing is moved to the individual components.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="YouTubeArchitectureStatus"><span>Architecture Status:</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Youtube-Component-Stage-Architecture.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Youtube-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png" alt="4 - Youtube Component Stage Architecture" width="1024" height="724" srcset="https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Youtube-Component-Stage-Architecture-1024x724.png 1024w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Youtube-Component-Stage-Architecture-300x212.png 300w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Youtube-Component-Stage-Architecture-768x543.png 768w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Youtube-Component-Stage-Architecture-1536x1086.png 1536w, https://edwarddeaver.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Youtube-Component-Stage-Architecture-2048x1448.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>

</div>
<div data-style="">

<p>&nbsp;<span>After I had the YouTube/Twitch/MongoDB components working, I moved onto sending the data to my Arduino Uno via Serial. This was accomplished using the NodeJS Serial library. Initially I was sending a hex string, then validating on the Arduino, splitting it into RGB values and then setting the data. This caused a lot of issues though, first it was slow, second it caused the Arduino to run out of memory if too many messages were sent at once ( I didn’t find this out until I could test with the LEDs).</span></p>

October 17, 2020 | https://docs.modboxgame.com/docs/mbscript | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://docs.modboxgame.com/docs/mbscript">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-container"><section><div ng-non-bindable=""><p>MBScript the scripting system for the game creation tool <a href="http://www.modboxgame.com/" target="_self" title="">Modbox</a>. It was designed instead of using a existing text scripting language (like Lua/Javascript) for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To allow for drag and drop editing without a keyboard. In VR \ AR, with Touch on a mobile device, or with a Gamepad.</li>
<li>Designed from the start to work online. All code runs online automatically so designers never have to think about networking code.</li>
<li>All changes made to MBScript code are also synced online to other players in real time - and can be edited while playing.</li>
<li>Uses the same C# type system that Modbox is built with. The type system is used to show the correct options while editing visual scripting.</li>
<li>Unlike node based visual scripting (like Blueprints / Playmaker), MBScript can be switched from visual mode to text mode at any time. A integrated VSCode like text editor (Monaco) is included with Modbox.</li>
<li>Code can be copied and pasted between the node based <a href="https://docs.modboxgame.com/docs/wiring" target="_self" title="" data-sidebar="wiring">Wiring</a> system, which uses MBScript</li>
<li>It's event based - with events being any variable changes or ingame events on any entity in the world - so MBScript code can be easily hooked into by other scripts / mods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here a MBScript asset is created to have the Entity 'Die' on Collision if the collision speed is over the 'Min Speed to Break' number variable. It also Prints the name of the Entity it collided with.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>MBScript assets can be created with the Edit Entity Desktop Window or the Edit VR Tool. Each asset creates a new <span v="Entity Component"><span>Entity Component</span><span><span><strong>Entity Component</strong> - <!-- -->Entity Components are on Entities and set their behavior and other properties such as physics / how they look. New components can be made in either MBScript or C# programming</span></span></span> type. MBScript Assets can be included in Entity <span v="Prefab"><span>Prefab</span><span><span><strong>Prefab</strong> - <!-- -->Prefabs are entity assets created ingame out of 1 or more other entities. Prefabs can then be shared online / between creations. (There is also Unity's Prefab system used in the ModboxSDK, which is different but same functionality)</span></span></span>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MBScript can be edited/run at anytime (Running in edit mode can be useful for creating Editor tools / operations. Editing in play mode is a easy way to test changes.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MBScript is also used to create <a href="https://docs.modboxgame.com/docs/game-managers" target="_self" title="" data-sidebar="game-managers">Game Managers</a> - which are MBScript assets that are added to the world automatically, and easily accessed by other scripts (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" target="_self" title="">Singletons </a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>MBScript code runs on <strong>Events</strong>, which allows for running code based on any event happening on the Entity or in the world (such as a variable changes value, or a world event happens like a player joins).</li>
</ul>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/774e0ad-SimpleMBScript.png" title="SimpleMBScript.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/774e0ad-SimpleMBScript.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>A Event line is added for the 'Start' event - printing 'Hello World' to the screen.</p><p>A new variable 'SwitchColors' is added, with default value 'True'. Here the Entity's Color will be set a random color every Update if 'SwitchColors' is True</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 'On' lines add <em>Event Lines</em> to run code on events. You can then add other code line types to set values / do operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set </strong>- Set a variable's value</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> - Do a method / operation / or event</li>
<li><strong>If</strong> - Run code if a condition is true. Can then add <em>Else</em> lines</li>
<li><strong>Print</strong> - Print a value to the screen, useful for quick testing</li>
<li><strong>ForEach </strong>- Run code on a list. “Do this to everything in this set". Can run ‘ForEach Entity in the world change it’s material to Wood’</li>
<li><strong>After</strong> - Run code after a set amount of time.<br>
There are a few other line types: ‘<strong>Local</strong>’ for temporary variables, <strong>Return </strong>to stop running code and return from an event, <strong>Repeat</strong> to do a loop for a set number of times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code can run on multiple events and have conditions setting when it runs:</p>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/b9e7def-MBScriptEventCondition.png" title="MBScriptEventCondition.png" width="smart" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/b9e7def-MBScriptEventCondition.png" title="Click to close..." width="smart" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>Here the first event line runs if the Entity's name changed, or if it just started.<br>
The second event line runs when a Collision happens, and if the collision was with a Animated Humanoid</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>After adding a code line you use the dropdowns to choose a variable or set a value.</p>
<p>After selecting a variable it will show if it still needs the expected type.</p>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/b6db279-ExpectedType.png" title="ExpectedType.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/b6db279-ExpectedType.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>The ‘If’ code line needs a ‘True/False’ value, so after selecting ‘Name’ (which is a Text variable) you still need to return a True/False value, so the ‘Select’ is shown to select an option inside the Name text.</p></figcaption></figure>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/2721401-ExpectedType2.png" title="ExpectedType2.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/2721401-ExpectedType2.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>‘Contains’ was selected to check if the name contains ‘Bob’. So if this is True the code inside the ‘If’ line will run.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ‘+’ at the end of the line can be used to continue the line with another operation. So because ‘Contains’ returns a True/False, you can then hit the ‘+’ button and select ‘IsFalse’ to invert that return value:</p>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/e2d779f-ExpectedType3.png" title="ExpectedType3.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/e2d779f-ExpectedType3.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>The code under this “If’ line will now run if the name doesn’t contain ‘Bob’.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can keep adding operations like this. Here the ‘Y’ part of the entity’s scale is selected, and set to the same Y value plus a random value:</p>
<p><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/412b714-ExpectedType4.png" title="ExpectedType4.png" width="smart" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/412b714-ExpectedType4.png" title="Click to close..." width="smart" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span></p>
<p>When selecting a variable in MBScript you select from either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables created in the Script</li>
<li>Local variables (added with Local line or as parameters to the Event)</li>
<li>Components on the Entity and their variables (like it's Name in the Main component, or Mass in the Physics component)</li>
<li>Variables in the World (like Gravity, or list of all Material Assets)</li>
<li>Or Functions (like 'Func.Random' for a random number)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hover over a icon to see a description of the variable and it's value.</p>
<p><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/b323c85-Hover.png" title="Hover.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/b323c85-Hover.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span></p><figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/68cc45e-Hover2.png" title="Hover2.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/68cc45e-Hover2.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>You can also hover to see the Value results at any time. Here hovering over Divide shows the value of the Health variable divided by 20</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>To change a variable value the Set line can be used to set to a new value (with "Set X to Y"). It can also be useful to do operations directly on the variable:</p>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/fd54b09-LerpCapture.PNG" title="LerpCapture.PNG" alt="" caption="" height="auto" width="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/fd54b09-LerpCapture.PNG" title="Click to close..." caption="" height="auto" width="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>'Do' can be used to run operations on variables. Here 1 is added to the Number1 variable<br>
The second line shows using the "Tween Lerp" operation to change a color variable over time. This can be run just once to have it slowly turn color every frame.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The 'ForEach' line can be used to iterate through lists - like the 'All Entities' list in the world.</p>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/04d2962-ForEachExam.png" title="ForEachExam.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/04d2962-ForEachExam.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>Go through all entities in the world and print their position</p></figcaption></figure>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/b116ed7-ForEachExam2.png" title="ForEachExam2.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/b116ed7-ForEachExam2.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>Go through all Primitive components in the world and print their Material value</p></figcaption></figure>
<figure><span role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://files.readme.io/772eaa1-ListQuery.png" title="ListQuery.png" width="80%" alt="" caption="" height="auto"><span autofocus="" role="dialog" tabindex="0"><span><img src="https://files.readme.io/772eaa1-ListQuery.png" title="Click to close..." width="80%" caption="" height="auto" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></span></span><figcaption><p>You can also do queries on lists (like C#'s LINQ).<br>
Here it prints the Entities that are in a physics body with a mass of greater than 10<br>
Could also keep adding to this, adding a 'OrderBy' to order it by mass.</p></figcaption></figure>

<ul>
<li>Code lines can be dragged by moving the drag handle. Multiple lines can be selected and moved at once. Variables and values can also be dragged to copy them.</li>
<li>Right click can be used to copy and paste MBScript (which just copies it to the Clipboard as text)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>MBScript can be copy and pasted as text.</li>
<li>At any time you can switch to text mode to edit, with autocomplete for variable names and immediate error updates. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the same script switched to text mode and edited, checking if the Entity has a 'Primitive Component' set on it, and if it does it prints the value of the Entity's <span v="Physics Material Asset"><span>Physics Material Asset</span><span><span><strong>Physics Material Asset</strong> - <!-- -->Physics Material Asset sets a Entity physics properties - including it's mass, it's Physics Sound Type, and on damage/collision effects</span></span></span> : </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Maintaining a free cloud app is an unsustainable hassle.</p>
<p>Pre-cloud, you could write a piece of software, compile it once for all the systems
you wanted to distribute it for, upload the binary somewhere (or send hard copies to people),
then go to the beach.</p>
<p>No cloud servers, no hosting bill, no scaling,
no keeping the servers alive.</p>
<p>Most of the APIs you'd use were part of the OS and changed very rarely, so
your app could last for decades with very little maintenance, maybe with none at all.</p>
<p>There's a lot to like about this model of development.
Users could rely on the software to continue to work as long as they had a system that can run the software,
even if the developer who wrote it stops maintaining it.
Developers were not on the hook to maintain production systems or go on-call for their app.</p>
<p>Back in the cloud era, however, If your app is used by your users to generate data they care about,
they will probably expect the data to be written to a persistent cloud store,
and to be able to load and edit it on different platforms and devices.</p>
<p>This necessitates running infrastructure which costs money and needs to be kept alive.</p>
<p>Users also implicitly expect the data to stick around for years or maybe decades,
which implies you need to attach some sort of business to your app and then run it for a while.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound very fun, and it's a deal-breaker for most hobby projects.</p>
<p>Some people persist out of love. For example, free spaced repetition app <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> has a cloud service for synchronising your decks and progress.
The Anki author, Damien Elmes, runs this service, is on call for it, pays for it, etc.
Without this service, Anki would be more inconvient - backups would suddenly be a lot more
important, and it wouldn't be possible to merge progress on multiple devices.</p>
<p>If Damien decides one day he doesn't want to do this anymore, he can't afford to do it, or something bad happens to him,
the app will be crippled. This doesn't seem sustainable.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is niche, but the same problem discourages free alternatives in many categories:
office suites, note taking apps, photo galleries, where persistance of data and cloud sync is critical.</p>
<h2>What if?</h2>
<p>To use most software, users need to bring a device and an internet connection.</p>
<p>What if as well as those things, they brought the cloud infrastructure?
What if each user had their own managed private cloud and there was a frictionless way to install your app to it?</p>
<p>There's some precedent for this. In the 90s it was common for ISPs to provide a small amount of storage (1-5MB) and access to a server to run your own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI scripts</a>.
If you were lucky, they might even run cron jobs for you.
You could run your own scripts, but people also ran other people's software, like guestbooks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)">IRC bouncers</a>.</p>
<p>What's would a modern version look like?</p>
<ul>
<li>ISPs could provide hosting of cloud functions, scheduled tasks, storage, and databases for each customer as part of their account offering.</li>
<li>There could be a standard way to package the code and database details, and a convenient way to install such packages for the user during app installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, this would allow me to run Anki's synchronisation service in my private cloud as long as I continue to pay my ISP bill.
I wouldn't have to worry about the maintainer's health.
Or, I could run a photo storage service on it, and worry slightly less about the implications of losing access to my Google account.</p>
<p>Obviously, third party hosts could provide this service, not ISPS -
there's just something I like about the coupling that frames it as a fundamental thing users should bring with them to use the internet.</p>
<h2>Projects that are kind of like this</h2>
<p>This almost certainly won't take off in the manner I've described.</p>
<p>But there's some similar things going on out there that give some hope:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sandstorm.io/">sandstorm.io</a> provides a packaging format and a container for running other people's services on your own hardware,
  with a marketplace. This could be really exciting, but it has not taken off - running something on your own hardware isn't mainstream or reliable and so the audience will always be quite limited.</li>
<li><a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> is a privacy-focused standardised way for users to host their data. There's providers
  hosting Solid pods, which is kind of exciting, but it doesn't seem to be taking off at all. It doesn't cover users running code, just storage.</li>
<li>If Google started giving away <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> private clouds to GSuite users,
  you'd get a similar result, albeit at the mercy of Google</li>
<li><a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> / <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> / <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/">Dapps</a> may eventually provide this type of capability using the Dweb,
  but most of the focus in this space seems to be on applications where developers continue to pay for the infrastructure (in the form of IPFS pinning or Filecoin).
  Not sure if many people are considering models where the users are bringing Filecoin / IPFS storage themselves.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[Dead Code Elimination in JavaScript]]>
            </title>
            <description>

October 17, 2020 | https://debugpai.com/dead-code-elimination-in-javascript | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://debugpai.com/dead-code-elimination-in-javascript">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Dead code elimination is a process wherein code that is not used is excluded from the code that is executed. In many compile time languages this is a much easier process since a compiler can easily determine the code that is used. However in javascript, this can be quite tricky since this clarity is not present.</p>
<p>There are several forms of dead code in javascript</p>
<ul>
<li>Unused source files</li>
<li>Environment specific code</li>
<li>Unused code in same file </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unused-source-files">Unused source files</h2>
<p>In the early days of javascript this used to be a real problem since unused source files had to be manually cleaned up. But with modern bundlers this becomes a really easy process. If a file is not imported anywhere then it is automatically excluded from the resulting bundle. There are also some plugins like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/unused-files-webpack-plugin">this one</a> which also help us to remove these from the codebase.</p>
<h2 id="environment-specific-code">Environment specific code</h2>
<p>In a real world app we have several environment specific code. These can be production, staging and development, mobile vs desktop or even domain specific logic. So when we build an app for production, we don't want to serve code to the user which is only used during development. </p>
<p>We can do this by using <a target="_blank" href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/">define-plugin</a> in webpack or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/replace">plugin-replace</a> in rollup. </p>
<pre><code>
<span>new</span> webpack.DefinePlugin({
  <span>'process.env.NODE_ENV'</span>: <span>JSON</span>.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV)
});
</code></pre>
<p>(webpack 4 does this automatically. this is just for showing what happens under the hood)</p>
<pre><code>
<span>plugins</span>: [
  replace({ <span>"process.env.NODE_ENV"</span>: <span>JSON</span>.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV) })
]
</code></pre>
<p>What this does is if you have code that looks like the following</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> API_HOST;
<span>if</span> (process.env.NODE_ENV === <span>'production'</span>) {
    API_HOST = <span>'production-host.mycompany.com'</span>;
} <span>else</span> {
    API_HOST = <span>'localhost:9000'</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Given <code>NODE_ENV=production</code>, it converts it to the following</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>'production'</span> === <span>'production'</span>) {
    API_HOST = <span>'production-host.mycompany.com'</span>;
} <span>else</span> {
    API_HOST = <span>'localhost:9000'</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then the minifier removes the unreachable code, reducing it down to the following,</p>
<pre><code><span>API_HOST</span> = <span>'production-host.mycompany.com'</span>
</code></pre><h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>
<p>This only works if you don't reassign the variable defined in the bundler config. In this case <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code>.</p>
<p>So if we change the code like the following</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> API_HOST;
<span>const</span> IS_PROD = process.env.NODE_ENV === <span>'production'</span>;
<span>if</span> (IS_PROD) {
    API_HOST = <span>'production-host.mycompany.com'</span>;
} <span>else</span> {
    API_HOST = <span>'localhost:9000'</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then the bundler will not be able to eliminate the dead code because it cannot know for sure the correct value of <code>IS_PROD</code> inside the if statement. Since the value could have changed after assignment of the variable and the if statement.</p>
<p>If you do want to use <code>IS_PROD</code> as a variable and have dead code elimination available then you can declare it in the plugin config like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>new</span> webpack.DefinePlugin({
  <span>'IS_PROD'</span>: process.env.NODE_ENV === <span>'production'</span>
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>plugins</span>: [
  replace({ <span>'IS_PROD'</span>: process.env.NODE_ENV === <span>'production'</span> })
]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="unused-code-in-same-file">Unused code in same file</h2>
<p>There are 2 kinds of unused code that can be part of the same file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unused exports</li>
<li>Side effects</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most difficult type of code to dead code eliminate because Javascript is not a compiled language. However modern bundlers are finding smart ways to do it. They use a technique called as <a target="_blank" href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">tree shaking</a> where they rely on static structure of ES Modules to achieve it.</p>
<h3 id="unused-exports">Unused Exports</h3>
<p>In modern web development, we use various libraries to get the job done. The problem however is that we don't need all the code that the library ships. </p>
<p>Consider a file like the following</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>function</span> <span>add</span> (<span>x, y</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> x + y;
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>subtract</span> (<span>x, y</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> x - y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we have another file where we import only one of the functions like</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { subtract } <span>from</span> <span>'./math'</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(subtract(<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>Then in the final resulting bundle only the <code>subtract</code> function is included. Add is excluded.</p>
<p>We can also combine this with Environment specific code which was highlighted in the previous section.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { subtract } <span>from</span> <span>'./math'</span>;

<span>if</span> (process.env.NODE_ENV === <span>'production'</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'This is production'</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Subtraction in dev mode only '</span> + subtract(<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we are calling <code>subtract</code> function only in development. In cases like this, <code>subtract</code> is bundled only in development mode. In production mode, neither <code>add</code> nor <code>subtract</code> functions are bundled.</p>
<p>This is possible because ES modules are static in nature as opposed to <code>commonjs</code> modules which due to their dynamic nature makes it impossible for the bundler to determine which modules to tree shake.</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (process.env.NODE_ENV === <span>'production'</span>) {
    <span>require</span>(<span>'./math.js'</span>).add(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
    <span>require</span>(<span>'./math.js'</span>).subtract(<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the main reason why <a target="_blank" href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a> which was based on commonjs modules created a new package <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/es">lodash-es</a> which is based on ES modules. This means that if we use only 1 function from <code>lodash-es</code> only that function will be bundled into our main bundle.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { reverse } <span>from</span> <span>'lodash-es'</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(reverse([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]));
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example only the <code>reverse</code> function will be bundled into the code.</p>
<h3 id="side-effects">Side Effects</h3>
<p>There is a caveat to tree shaking and that is side effects. Side effects in terms of tree shaking is any code that changes global state or environment in some way. Examples can be polyfills and code in which css files are added. </p>
<p>Consider a polyfill for fetch like this</p>
<pre><code>

<span>window</span>.fetch = <span><span>function</span>(<span>...</span>) </span>{ ... }
</code></pre>
<p>In the above file, fetch is being added to window object but its not being exported or imported from anywhere. Hence the bundler cannot know that this is used.
For these files where side effects are present, we need to explicitly specify them in <code>package.json</code></p>
<pre><code><span>"sideEffects"</span>: [
    './fetchPolyfill.js'
]
</code></pre>
<p>It is then bundled in the application like this:</p>
<pre><code>__webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__),(<span>window</span>.fetch = <span><span>function</span>(<span></span>) ... )</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="vendor-dependencies">Vendor dependencies</h3>
<p>Before using any open source library in your package, you can go to <a target="_blank" href="https://bundlephobia.com/">bundlephobia</a> to verify if the package you are using is side effect free and tree shakeable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I have been using <a href="https://cmake.org/">cmake</a> for a while because I
think writing good Makefile is a very tricky task. Unfortunately, cmake
is not always available and writing a Makefile is the only solution.
I decided to spend some time on writing a small Makefile structure that
I could use for new projects and would share my journey to this quest
with you.</p>
<p>The material of this article is also available on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/morandg/perfect-makefile">gitlab</a></p>

<p>Here is what I expect from a well written Makefile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes well care of parallel builds</li>
<li>Makes easy to add a new source files</li>
<li>Makes cross compilation easy</li>
<li>Has fancy and debug output</li>
<li>Rebuilds only and everything that is required on changes</li>
<li>Can enable debug or release compilation mode</li>
<li>Builds the unit tests when requested</li>
<li>Finds depedencies to other libraries automatically</li>
<li>Generates sources automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>That may sound a lot but it should be the bare minimal to make it usable
in complex projects.</p>

<p>To illustrate the usage of this Makefile, I will implement an
overengineered Fibonnaci numbers computation. I won't spend too much
time on the details here but this will give us some source files to
compile.</p>

<p>Let's start writing the basic structure of our project with a entry
point and some interfaces. The tree looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>├── Makefile
└── src
    ├── FibonacciNumbersRecursed.cpp
    ├── FibonacciNumbersRecursed.hpp
    ├── IFibonacciNumbers.cpp
    ├── IFibonacciNumbers.hpp
    └── main.cpp
</pre></div>


<p>We have an entry point in main.cpp, an interface to compute fibonacci
numbers and a first implementation that does nothing for now. Let's now
write a basic Makefile.</p>

<p>First we define some useful variables that can be reused later:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PROJECT</span>             <span>=</span> fibonacci
<span>BUILD_DIR</span>           <span>?=</span> build
</pre></div>


<p>The binary and the list of source files will also be saved in a
variable:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>APP_BIN</span>             <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>BUILD_DIR<span>)</span>/<span>$(</span>PROJECT<span>)</span>
<span>APP_SOURCES</span>         <span>=</span> src/IFibonacciNumbers.cpp <span>\</span>
                      src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.cpp <span>\</span>
                      src/main.cpp
</pre></div>


<p>Here we create a list of compiled <em>.o</em> files from the list of sources,
that can be used as a prerequist list.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>APP_OBJS</span>            <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>patsubst %.cpp,<span>$(</span>BUILD_DIR<span>)</span>/%.o,<span>$(</span>APP_SOURCES<span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Define here all the compiler flags:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>COMMON_CFLAGS</span>       <span>=</span> -Wall -Werror -Wextra
<span>CFLAGS</span>              <span>+=</span> <span>$(</span>COMMON_CFLAGS<span>)</span>
<span>CXXFLAGS</span>            <span>+=</span> <span>$(</span>COMMON_CFLAGS<span>)</span> -std<span>=</span>c++14
</pre></div>


<p>Now we have all the variables we need, we can start writing a default
target that is by convention <em>all</em>. It will simply build the main
binary:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>all</span><span>:</span> <span>$(</span><span>APP_BIN</span><span>)</span>
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>all</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now how to link the binary:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$(APP_BIN)</span><span>:</span> <span>$(</span><span>APP_OBJS</span><span>)</span>
    <span>$(</span>CXX<span>)</span> -o <span>$@</span> <span>$(</span>APP_OBJS<span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>How each source will be built:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o</span><span>:</span> %.<span>cpp</span>
    mkdir -p <span>$(</span>dir <span>$@</span><span>)</span>
    <span>$(</span>CXX<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>CXXFLAGS<span>)</span> -c $&lt; -o <span>$@</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally a small clean target:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>clean</span><span>:</span>
    rm -rf <span>$(</span>BUILD_DIR<span>)</span>
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>clean</span>
</pre></div>



<p>Let's give a first attempt to make to build our application:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ make
mkdir -p build/src/
g++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std<span>=</span>c++14 -c src/IFibonacciNumbers.cpp -o build/src/IFibonacciNumbers.o
mkdir -p build/src/
g++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std<span>=</span>c++14 -c src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.cpp -o build/src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.o
mkdir -p build/src/
g++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std<span>=</span>c++14 -c src/main.cpp -o build/src/main.o
g++ -o build/fibonacci build/src/IFibonacciNumbers.o build/src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.o build/src/main.o

$ ./build/fibonacci
Computing using implementation recursive
Fibonacci number of <span>3</span> is ... <span>3</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The application is not implemented but at least it generates a working
executable. Let's see what goals we have achieved until now.</p>

<p>This is important to build the project faster by making use of all CPUs.
We can check if make behaves correctly with the <em>-j</em> option. After
cleaning and rebuilding the project with different jobs, it always
succeeds. We can also see that the sources files are built in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ make
$ make clean
$ make -j2
$ make clean
$ make -j3
$ ...
</pre></div>



<p>When adding a new source file, the Makefile should have as least changes
as possible. To demonstrate this, we simply add a new Fibonacci number
implementation and update the source list:</p>
<div><pre><span></span> APP_BIN             = $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)
 APP_SOURCES         = src/IFibonacciNumbers.cpp \
                       src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.cpp \
<span>+                      src/FibonacciNumbersDynamic.cpp \</span>
                       src/main.cpp
 APP_OBJS            = $(patsubst %.cpp,$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o,$(APP_SOURCES))
</pre></div>


<p>The application is updated in order to be able to choose the
implementation at runtime. We can now check that it works as expected:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ make
<span># ...</span>

$ ./build/fibonacci -t <span>0</span>
Computing using implementation recursive
Fibonacci number of <span>3</span> is ... <span>3</span>

$ ./build/fibonacci -t <span>1</span>
Computing using implementation dynamic
Fibonacci number of <span>3</span> is ... <span>3</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Some poeple would prefere having a function that automatically searches
for all the source files with something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SOURCES</span> <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>shell find src -name <span>'*.cpp'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, we lose a bit of control on which source file we want to
include in the build in case we support different platforms which don't
use the same sources files. This is why I'm fine with adding a line in
the Makefile when I add a new source file in the project for more
control on what is being built.</p>

<p>When using multiple hardware, it should be easy to build for another
architecture with the minimal effort. In our case, cross compiling can
be done by defining another build directory and compiler on the command
line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ make <span>BUILD_DIR</span><span>=</span>build_arm <span>CXX</span><span>=</span>arm-linux-g++
<span># ...</span>
</pre></div>



<p>We don't want make to print the executed commands that is very verbose,
this can be done by adding the <em>@</em> character at the beginning of the
command. When something goes wrong, we need to see what is done. This
should be enabled with an environment variable.</p>
<p>First we define an environement variable to enable the verbose mode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>ifneq ($(V),)</span>
  <span>SILENCE</span>           <span>=</span>
<span>else</span>
  <span>SILENCE</span>           <span>=</span> @
<span>endif</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Update all the recipes consequently:</p>
<div><pre><span></span> $(APP_BIN): $(APP_OBJS)
<span>-       $(CXX) -o $@ $(APP_OBJS)</span>
<span>+       $(SILENCE)$(CXX) -o $@ $(APP_OBJS)</span>

 $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.cpp
<span>-       mkdir -p $(dir $@)</span>
<span>-       $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $@</span>
<span>+       $(SILENCE)mkdir -p $(dir $@)</span>
<span>+       $(SILENCE)$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $@</span>

 clean:
<span>-       rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)</span>
<span>+       $(SILENCE)rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)</span>
 .PHONY: clean
</pre></div>


<p>Now we can enable the verbose mode by setting the <em>V</em> environment
variable to any value:</p>



<p>Unfortunately, in silent mode, we don't see anything:</p>



<p>Some feedback is always good in order to know what happens behind the
hood. However, we can print something nicer than the build command and
use for that some <em>printf</em> that can be reused:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SHOW_COMMAND</span>        <span>:=</span> @printf <span>"%-15s%s\n"</span>
<span>SHOW_CXX</span>            <span>:=</span> <span>$(</span>SHOW_COMMAND<span>)</span> <span>"[ </span><span>$(</span>CXX<span>)</span><span> ]"</span>
<span>SHOW_CLEAN</span>          <span>:=</span> <span>$(</span>SHOW_COMMAND<span>)</span> <span>"[ CLEAN ]"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Update the recipe to print the status of the build:</p>
<div><pre><span></span> $(APP_BIN): $(APP_OBJS)
<span>+       $(SHOW_CXX) $@</span>
       $(SILENCE)$(CXX) -o $@ $(APP_OBJS)

 $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.cpp
<span>+       $(SHOW_CXX) $@</span>
       $(SILENCE)mkdir -p $(dir $@)
       $(SILENCE)$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $@

 clean:
<span>+       $(SHOW_CLEAN) $(BUILD_DIR)</span>
       $(SILENCE)rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)
 .PHONY: clean
</pre></div>


<p>Now the bulid is more verbose but still very comfortable to watch:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ make
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/IFibonacciNumbers.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/FibonacciNumbersDynamic.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/main.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/fibonacci

$ make clean
<span>[</span> CLEAN <span>]</span>      build
</pre></div>


<p>Nice!</p>

<p>This is very important for big projects, we don't want to recompile
everything if we changed only one source file. When using unit tests, we
want to have a feedback aboout our changes as fast as possible, to
achieve this we need to recompile only the files that changed.</p>
<p>As a first test, we will check what happens if we update a source file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ touch src/IFibonacciNumbers.cpp

$ make
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/IFibonacciNumbers.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/fibonacci
</pre></div>


<p>The file gets compiled and the binary linked again, this seems correct.
However, having a nice depedency of headers is more difficult to
maintain as demonstrated here:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ touch src/IFibonacciNumbers.hpp

$ make
make: Nothing to be <span>done</span> <span>for</span> <span>'all'</span>.
</pre></div>


<p>We would expect <em>main.cpp</em> and <em>IFibonacciNumbers.cpp</em> to be compiled
again as those include the modified header. We could manually list the
header depedency for each source file like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>main.o</span><span>:</span> <span>main</span>.<span>cpp</span> <span>IFibonacciNumbers</span>.<span>hpp</span>
<span>IFibonacciNumbers.o</span><span>:</span> <span>IFibonacciNumbers</span>.<span>cpp</span> <span>IFibonacciNumbers</span>.<span>hpp</span>
<span># ...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But this is a nightmare to maintain and is source of mistakes when the
project evolve! Fortunately, the compiler is able to generate this list
of depedencies automatically with the <em>-MMD</em> argument that will generate
a file with the .d extension. First we add this flags:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-COMMON_CFLAGS       = -Wall -Werror -Wextra</span>
<span>+COMMON_CFLAGS       = -Wall -Werror -Wextra -MMD</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Out of curiosity, let's have a look at the list of generated files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ make
<span># ...</span>

$ find build/ <span>|</span> grep <span>\\</span>.d<span>\$</span>
build/src/main.d
build/src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.d
build/src/FibonacciNumbersDynamic.d
build/src/IFibonacciNumbers.d

$ cat build/src/main.d
build/src/main.o: src/main.cpp src/IFibonacciNumbers.hpp
</pre></div>


<p>A rule is automatically generated with the list of headers, exactly what
we need! We must now include those rules in our Makfile by defining a
list of generated depedency files, that is the list of objects with the
.d extension:</p>



<p>And include them right after the default target:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>all</span><span>:</span> <span>$(</span><span>APP_BIN</span><span>)</span>
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>all</span>

<span>-include $(DEPS)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now verify that it works as expected when modifying different header:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ touch src/IFibonacciNumbers.hpp
$ make
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/IFibonacciNumbers.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/FibonacciNumbersRecursed.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/FibonacciNumbersDynamic.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/main.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/fibonacci

$ touch src/FibonacciNumbersDynamic.hpp
$ make
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/IFibonacciNumbers.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/src/FibonacciNumbersDynamic.o
<span>[</span> g++ <span>]</span>        build/fibonacci
</pre></div>


<p>Much better!</p>

<p>Chess is (unfortunately) a man’s world, and gender differences in chess are large. While the gap in average play is not large between men and women, differences at the top are striking: Among the top 50 players in the world (according to the <a href="http://ratings.fide.com/download.phtml">FIDE Standard Rating List</a> from October 16th)  there is not a single woman. Among the top 500 players are only seven (Judit Polgar, Yifan Hou, Humpy Koneru, Aleksandra Goryachkina, Susan Polgar, Jun Xie and Wenjun Ju). </p>



<p>In this post I will argue that the gender gap between men and women is large in most countries. This gap cannot be explained simply by looking at differences in the number of men and women in chess. The code for this analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/nikosbosse/gender-differences-chess/">here</a>. </p>



<h5>Explaining the performance gap</h5>



<p>Various explanations have been proposed, pointing to a hostile environment in chess, cultural norms, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variability_hypothesis">differences in innate ability</a>. </p>



<p>Professor Wei Ji Ma recently posted an <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/what-gender-gap-in-chess">article</a> on <a href="https://chessbase.com/">chessbase</a> in which he offered a different explanation. The idea (previously published in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.1576">this article</a>) is this: Looking at the top performers is a very bad way of comparing two distributions with very different sample sizes. </p>



<p>Let’s say you have a large urn with balls that have the numbers 1 to 100 000 written on it. No you make two piles of unequal size. The first one has 10 balls, the second one has 100 balls. The average between both groups will probably be similar. But if you draw 100 times, you have many more shots at drawing an outlier, i.e. a very high number. The maximum value in the larger groups will therefore probably be much higher, even as you draw from the same urn. </p>



<p>The argument works similarly for women in chess. The FIDE Standard Rating List currently has 7.6% women. A greater number of men means that there is a greater chance of finding exceptionally good chess players. We could therefore see the chess world dominated by men, even if the two distributions were exactly the same. </p>



<h5>Permutation analysis</h5>



<p>How can we find out whether a difference in top performance is random or systematic? To achieve that, Ma conducted a permutation analysis. Let’s assume the difference between men and women can be explained by sample size alone. If that is true, then it doesn’t matter whether or not we split the entirety of all chess players according to gender or according to any other arbitrary criterion. What matters is only the size of the smaller group and the size of the larger group. </p>



<p>Let us take a random sample of a size exactly equal to the number of all women and call it “small group”. The rest of the players are put in the “large group”. If really only the sample size matters, we should see a difference between top performers of our random “small group” and top performers in the “large group” approximately equal to the actually observed difference between men and women. </p>



<p>If we repeat this process many many times (each time drawing a new random small and large group), we obtain a distribution of differences between the two groups. This allows us to estimate how likely the actual gender difference among top performers would arise purely based on sample sizes. If the difference is more than what we would expect based on sample size, we need to look for other causes. </p>



<p>Professor Ma looked at gender differences in the performance of chess players in India. He finds that the difference between men and women among top Indian players can be fully explained by differences in sample size. In fact, women in India tend to <em>overperform</em> given their small number.</p>



<p>I replicated his analysis and conducted a second one including all chess players from the world. I found results similar to those of Ma in India. For the world, a very different picture emerges.</p>



<h5>Performance differences in India</h5>



<p>Professor Ma took the FIDE Standard Rating List from October 6th (while I used the one from October 16th). He only looked at Indian players and removed all players born in 2000 and later, arguing that ratings for younger players might be unstable. This left him with 19 064 players, of whom 17 899 (93.9%) were male and 1 165 (6.1%) were female. </p>



<p>I included those born in 2000 in my analysis and ended up with 20 532 players, 19 159 (93.3%) of them male and 1373 (6.7%) of them female. Here are some basic summary statistics of ELO ratings in the two groups: </p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>sex</strong></td><td><strong>number</strong></td><td><strong>mean</strong></td><td><strong>median</strong></td><td><strong>sd</strong></td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>1 373</td><td>1 443</td><td>1 364</td><td>319</td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>19 159</td><td>1 425</td><td>1 359</td><td>290</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And here is the relative distribution of ELO ratings of female and male players in India: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="480" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/india-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/india-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/india-1-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/india-1.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/india-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/india-1-300x214.png 300w"></figure>



<p>I conducted to different analyses: In one I followed Ma and looked only at the best player in both groups. In the second one, I looked at the average of the top ten players in both groups. For the best performer, the difference in ELO was <strong>167</strong>. For the average of the ten best performers, the difference was <strong>269.3</strong>. </p>



<p>The results of my permutation analysis large confirm those of Professor Ma. Here are simulated performance differences for the best players: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="480" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-300x214.png 300w"></figure>



<p>The mean difference in the simulation was <strong>143.47</strong> (compared to an actual difference of 167). Plotting the distribution of simulated differences (black) and the actual observed differences (red), we see that the difference between the best male and female players in India are well within what we expect given random chance. Looking at the summary statistics above, we see that female players also outperform male players on average. </p>



<p>If we look at the average of the top 10 players, a similar picture emerges: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="480" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-1-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-india-1-1-300x214.png 300w"></figure>



<p>The observed difference (269.3 vs. simulated mean of 248.2) is well within the range expected by pure chance. </p>



<h5>Performance differences in the World</h5>



<p>Let’s look at the rest of the world. We now have 263 387 players in total, 243 375 (92.4%) of them male and 20 012 (7.6%) of them female. Here are again summary statistics for the two groups: </p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>sex</strong></td><td><strong>number</strong></td><td><strong>mean</strong></td><td><strong>median</strong></td><td><strong>sd</strong></td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>20 012</td><td>1 674</td><td>1 679</td><td>317</td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>243 375</td><td>1 761</td><td>1 774</td><td>313</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And the distribution of ELO ratings: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="480" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/world-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/world-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/world-1-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/world-1.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/world-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/world-1-300x214.png 300w"></figure>



<p>Here it looks like men have a slight advantage over women. The difference between the best male (Magnus Carlsen) and best female player (Judit Polgar) is <strong>188</strong> points. Let’s examine the distribution of simulated differences: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="480" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-300x214.png 300w"></figure>



<p>The mean difference in the simulations is <strong>88.46</strong>.  The actually observed difference (188) is higher than 99.2% of all simulated differences. According to this analysis it therefore seems very unlikely that the gap between men and women can be explained purely by differences in sample sizes. </p>



<p>If we look at the difference between the average top ten players, the difference is even more pronounced. The actually observed difference is <strong>210.6</strong>, while simulations suggest an average difference of <strong>107.81</strong>. <em>All</em> simulated values were below the difference we actually observe between men and women. This is not good. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="480" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-1-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/distribution-world-1-1-300x214.png 300w"></figure>



<h5>Gender differences among countries</h5>



<p>We have seen a large difference in gender equality between India and the world as a whole. Even though the absolute performance difference in India is quite large, India actually seems more equitable than the rest of the world. Indian women, on average, perform better than men. The difference among Indian top players is in the range of what we would expect based on differences in sample size. </p>



<p>Let us look at differences in median performance between women and men across different countries (I removed all countries with fewer than 3000 registered players): </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/country-performance-1.png" alt="" width="580" height="414" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/country-performance-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/country-performance-1-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/country-performance-1.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/country-performance-1.png 672w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/country-performance-1-300x214.png 300w"></figure>



<p>Sadly, it seems, India is an outlier. Almost all of the large chess nations (except Denmark) see men performing better than women on average. This analysis is slightly different from the permutation analysis conducted above. The median, however, should be quite robust to outliers and differences in samples sizes.  It is therefore a suitable measure of average performance. </p>



<p>This map shows differences in the median performance of men and women. Dark blue values mean that men are performing better, lighter blue values indicate that women outperform men on average. </p>

</div></div>



<h5>What to make of the results</h5>



<p>I could confirm Professor Ma’s results regarding the performance of Indian chess players. It seems that indeed, India is one of the more equitable countries. Even though the number of Indian women in chess is relatively small, they do not seem to systematically underperform (and may even be overperforming). </p>



<p>For the rest of the world, the picture looks less charitable. Women perform worse than men on average in most nations.</p>



<p>In search of an explanation, I also looked at the correlation between differences in ELO ratings and the proportion of women in a country. The correlation I found was 0.12. This implies that the participation rate of women in chess can only explain a small fraction of differences across countries.</p>



<p>It seems that overall, chess is not an equitable sport. Outside of a few countries such as India or Australia, men dominate chess across the board (no pun intended). Men perform better on average and the difference in performance among the top players can hardly be explained by sample sizes alone.</p>



<p>I know to little of the chess world to speculate about the causes of the gender gap in chess. But I believe that the low participation rate of women in chess is a pity and that we need to address the systematic challenges women face.</p>

<div>

<div itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://status.healthchecks.io/">status.healthchecks.io</a> used to set an “ajs_anonymous_id” tracking cookie. I’m happy to report that it does not do that anymore since September 22, 2020. In this post, I’ll share the process I went through to get the tracking cookie removed.</p>
<p>For powering status.healthchecks.io, I am using a third-party hosted status page provider, Statuspage.io, by Atlassian. I initially set it up in May 2020 and <a href="https://blog.healthchecks.io/2020/05/healthchecks-io-status-page-facelift/">wrote about it on this blog</a>. After the setup, while poking around, I discovered my fancy new status page sets a tracking cookie. It does not ask for the user’s consent, and it does not obey the “DNT” header – when you visit the page, you get a tracking cookie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this cookie was only used for innocuous purposes (tracking the number of unique page visitors), but it still invades site visitors’ privacy and violates GDPR requirements. On May 7, I submitted a support ticket asking to remove the tracking cookie and got a reply with a bottom line: “We can’t avoid setting these cookies.” After asking again, I got back a non-commital “I will forward this to our product team and development team,” and that was that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already invested a significant amount of time setting up automation and custom metrics for the status page. And, aside from the cookie issue, I was generally happy with the product. Before switching providers over this one issue, I wanted to take a crack at fixing it. It was unlikely Atlassian would spend any engineering resources just because a single $29/mo customer had complaints. So I needed to bump up the priority of the issue. I searched around for other Statuspage.io customers and started contacting them. My email template went through several iterations until I got to a version that felt transparent and not manipulative:</p>

<blockquote><p>Subject: Cookies on status.somedomain.com<br>Hello,</p><p>when I visit status.somedomain.com I see it stores the following cookies in my browser:</p><p>* ajs_anonymous_id<br>* ajs_group_id</p><p>These are Atlassian’s tracking cookies. They are not essential, and so under GDPR they require the user’s explicit opt-in before they can be sent to the browser.</p><p>I am an Atlassian Statuspage customer myself, and my service’s status page has the exact same problem. I’ve contacted Atlassian about this but this appears to be low priority for them.</p><p>I am contacting you because I think more affected customers being aware of the issue and asking Atlassian to fix it = higher chance that they will actually do something.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Pēteris Caune</p></blockquote>
<p>I started by manually sending ten or so emails out every week. I mostly got sympathetic and cooperative responses. There were some funny ones too. For example, one guy insisted that there is no problem because he could not reproduce the issue using “internal methods.” Me showing him the results of several different cookie scanning services (<a href="https://cookie-script.com/">cookie-script.com</a>, <a href="https://www.cookiebot.com/en/">cookiebot.com</a>) did not sway him.</p>
<p>I kept contacting other companies, and they sometimes forwarded me the responses they were getting from Atlassian. From these responses, it didn’t look like we were making much progress. In July, two months in, I decided to amp things up. I grabbed the <a href="https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million">Majestic Million</a> dataset with the top million websites. I wrote a script that goes through the list, and, for each website, checks if it has an Atlassian-operated “status” subdomain. The script produced an HTML page with filtered results and “mailto:” links, to help me send out the emails. Side note: did you know the “mailto:” links <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#Specifying_details">can specify the message body</a>?</p>
<p>To find email addresses, I found the best way was to look at each website’s privacy policy and search for the “@” symbol. I found typical contact addresses were <strong>privacy</strong>@somedomain.com and <strong>dpo</strong>@somedomain.com (where “dpo” stands for Data Protection Officer). On July 26-27, one by one, I sent out emails to around 200 companies.</p>
<p>The wave of new support tickets from various companies worked. Atlassian started communicating back a plan to implement a cookie consent banner in Q1 2021. Later in August, they started saying “late September 2020”. I held off from sending more emails and waited to see what would happen in September.</p>
<p>On September 22, I received an update from Atlassian. Instead of implementing a cookie consent banner, they decided to drop the Page Analytics feature, which was responsible for the tracking cookie.&nbsp;From my point of view, this is the best possible outcome – no tracking cookie and no consent banner. Statuspage.io still has an option of adding a Google Analytics tag. So, there still is&nbsp;<em>a way</em>&nbsp;to track the unique visits for those who need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, Atlassian / Statuspage.io, for implementing this change. I appreciate it! To my contact at Atlassian support, thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To everyone who also contacted Atlassian about the tracking cookies, thank you! It took a team effort, but it worked out in the end!</p>
<p>– Pēteris</p>

<p>I loved this quote from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791">Software Engineering at Google</a>. Found it a helpful reminder.</p>



<blockquote><p>Earlier we made the assertion that “code is a liability, not an asset.” If that is true, why have we spent most of this book discussing the most efficient way to build software systems that can live for decades? Why put all that effort into creating more code when it’s simply going to end up on the liability side of the balance sheet? Code itself doesn’t bring value: it is the functionality that it provides that brings value. That functionality is an asset if it meets a user need: the code that implements this functionality is simply a means to that end. If we could get the same functionality from a single line of maintainable, understandable code as 10,000 lines of convoluted spaghetti code, we would prefer the former. Code itself carries a cost — the simpler the code is, while maintaining the same amount of functionality, the better.</p></blockquote>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ff1f1677bf36496f03d8"><div><p>As most of the major media categories — music, video and video games — have existed for decades, we tend to forget that media is technology. Instead, we think of technology as being used to express media, rather than media itself. Spotify, for example, is an <em>internet</em> <em>streaming </em>music service, while iTunes is a <em>download </em>music service, SiriusXM is <em>satellite</em> <em>broadcast</em> music service, and radio is a <em>terrestrial broadcast</em> technology. This focus on delivery ignores the classic definition of media: “<span>outlets</span> or <span>tools</span> used to <span>store</span> and <span>deliver</span> information or data.”</p><p>While the above might seem preoccupied with theory and philosophy, all analysis of the past and future of a given media category must start from the fact that media is technology. This is because technology not only enables content categories, it defines their business models and shapes the content, too. And as we know, technology is in a constant process of change. </p><p><strong>Chapter 1: How Technology Created Recorded Media, Then Continually Redefined It</strong></p><p>Music offers a great view into the interplay between technology, business model and content. Consider the following triptych, which covers seven decades, two decades and one year, respectively.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602797899091_5458"><div><p>&nbsp;When the flat record first emerged in the 1850s, it standardized around the 78. The 78 (as in 78 rotations per minute) came in a 10-inch version that held three minutes of music and a 12-inch version that held four. This meant that after centuries of variability, music suddenly had a defined run-time.&nbsp;</p><p>This length was reaffirmed by the first mass market standard for consumer media: the 45 RPM vinyl single, which launched in 1948 and held roughly three minutes. The music industry coalesced around this format (and its runtime) for a variety of tech-based reasons. The 45 was far cheaper for consumers than a 78 album, which was important given the high cost of record players and the ubiquity of free (singles-focused) radio. The 45’s cost advantage also meant it was the primary way labels delivered singles to thousands of radio stations across the country for local airplay. In addition, RCA quickly figured out how to make a stackable version of 45s, which was important to jukebox manufacturers. The rise of the 45 naturally led the length of the average song to decline; a four-minute song simply couldn’t fit on the most important audio format in the world.</p><p>As the physical and financial limitations of the 78 and 45 were relieved, and the far more flexible cassette and CD emerged, the length of the average single grew rapidly, adding nearly two minutes (or 78%) from 1959 to 1992. Still, almost all tracks conformed to the three-to-four minute standard. After decades, the West had become used to the idea that a song was roughly between three minutes and 20 seconds and four minutes and 10 seconds long.</p><p>On its surface, the shift to digital audio should have led to further increases in song length. After all, there was no longer any limitation to run-time. However, the reverse occurred. Technology might have relaxed its grip on music’s length, but it had strengthened its hold on business models.</p><p>As is well known, iTunes unbundled the physical album in individually downloadable (and bought) tracks. But in doing so, it penalized artists for bundling a multi-part song into a single track. Pink Floyd’s decision to split the 26-minute and nine-part Shine on You Crazy Diamond into two discrete tracks didn’t matter in 1975; all nine parts fit on a single record and no one wanted to buy just a single half let alone a single part. But in 2005, such a move could mean missing out on 75% of revenues — why sell two things when you could sell nine? And why would a consumer buy an entire $10 album if all they wanted was two $1 portions of Shine on You Crazy Diamond? These incentives naturally led to artists that were publishing new music to split their longer/multi-section songs into separate — and shorter — preludes, interludes and segments.</p><p>This behaviour has been greatly exacerbated by the advent of a new and even more disruptive digital music technology: on-demand streaming. While iTunes was technically innovative, its business model was not. Consumers, after all, primarily owned copies of individual tracks in the 1950s and 1960s. Spotify and Apple Music, meanwhile, meant consumers adopted not just a new music technology, but also bought an entirely different product: ongoing access to all music ever created.</p><p>But as technology has shifted consumers away from discrete and attributable transactions (buying record A on date B) to ongoing and general ones (subscribing to service C in perpetuity), musical talent needed a new compensation model. Spotify, therefore, decided to pay talent as and to the degree consumers listened to their works. Matching revenue with usage is intuitive, but it was never before possible in music. There was no way to track at-home record spins or CD plays, let alone charge for them. Nor was it practical for iTunes to ask users to download an individual song to their devices and pay several pennies per play when they later synched their iPod to iTunes. (This would have been rife with abuse, too.)</p><p>Engagement-based monetization is arguably more fair. Consider, for example, that the Beatles’ <em>Yesterday </em>and Psy’s <em>Gangnam Style</em> would each generate $1 when sold on iTunes, even if the former was played 2,000 times over ten years and the latter 30 times in the month it was bought and then never again. But the more that business models change, the more that incentives and content change, too.</p><p>To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties.&nbsp;</p><p>So as the music industry has transitioned the majority of its revenues from CDs and downloads to streaming, major artists have relentlessly shortened and split their tracks. Why release a five-minute song if you can make it a two and a half-minute song that’s played twice? Or two different two and a half-minute songs? This meant artists had yet another reason to reduce track lengths</p><p>All of this helps to explain the extraordinary success of the 2019’s top track, <em>Old Town Road </em>by Lil Nas X, which is also Billboard’s longest running #1 ever, at 19 consecutive weeks. While the song is awesome, it’s also only one minute and 53 seconds — roughly half of 2019’s average song length. This means that four minutes of listening generated two times the average revenue and charting lift of every other hit song that year.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t an exception, either. Up until 2017, Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart has never had a year with more than 2% of its charting tracks shorter than two minutes and 30 seconds (most years had none). In the past three years, this sum has skyrocketed to over 12%, or roughly one in every eight tracks.</p><p>Notably, labels are also encouraging artists to simplify the name of their songs and albums in order to ensure they’re optimized for voice-controlled speakers and touchscreen-based searches. A track with five words is more likely to be misunderstood or suffer from autocorrect than one with two. Similarly, voice assistants are known to struggle with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/voice-is-the-next-big-platform-unless-you-have-an-accent/">accents</a>, such as Irish or even Texan. Being hard to say means you might not get played.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t the first time technology made a hit. In fact, the modern day dominance of rap and R&amp;B comes from how changes in technology – not for delivery, but sales recognition –&nbsp; afforded Lil Nas X the opportunity to top the charts in the first place.</p><p>Prior to the 1990s, Black artists and music fans had spent decades arguing the record industry conspired against “urban contemporary” music by refusing it radio play and ignoring its sales. It took only five weeks after Billboard adopted SoundScan, a computerized sales database, to prove this theory right.</p><p>Until 1991, Billboard charts weren’t based on actual unit sales or radio play. Instead, it was assembled using (white) retail clerk estimates of what was selling best and what (white) DJs considered to be “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/">hottest</a>” each week. According to <em>The Atlantic</em>, both groups had<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/"> reasons to lie</a>. For example, labels would pressure radio stations to favour “hand-picked hits” if they wanted to keep receiving the newest single on time (stations sometimes<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola"> received bribes to play specific tracks</a>, too). Meanwhile, labels would force inventory on their retailers, who would then overreport sales to convince music fans to buy excess inventory.</p><p>Naturally, those who ran the music industry saw little need to overhaul how it worked. And thus while the book and film industries had shifted to computerized sales databases in the 1980s, not one of the top six record distributors signed onto SoundScan before its release in June 1991. But this resistance didn’t stop N.W.A.’s <em>N***az4life</em> from debuting #2 on the Billboard Top 100 the very next month under SoundScan. This was the highest charting performance in rap history – and happened without any radio airplay, music video airings on MTV, or a concert tour. The failings of the old honour system were further demonstrated by the fact that N.W.A. debuted at only #21 on Billboard’s R&amp;B chart, which wasn’t yet on SoundScan. Somehow it was possible that <em>N***az4life</em> was the second biggest album in the country by units purchased, but 21st in its own genre when it came to what was “selling” and “hottest.” One week after it’s release, the album hit #1 on the Billboard chart (displacing R.E.M) as hundreds …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been working on a side project recently, related to <a href="https://tabbydata.com/">this other blog</a> that I started a few weeks back. (The project isn’t ready to share quite yet, but you might be able to guess what I’m working on from those posts!)</p>

<p>Even though I’ve tried to become much more pragmatic in my technology choices over the years, side projects still end up being a great way to experiment with new, shiny things—or at least, new <em>to me</em>. (As a side note, this aspect of side projects—selecting the right stack and practice learning new technologies—is one of the two main reasons I believe in the controversial idea that engineers who program outside of work are generally better at it than those who do not. The other reason is that it demonstrates they actually enjoy using their superpower.) The latest new, shiny thing for me is AWS Cloud9.</p>

<h2 id="what-problem-does-it-solve">What problem does it solve?</h2>

<p>AWS Cloud9 allows developers to build software entirely within their browser. In doing so, it actually solves a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The local environment doesn’t matter anymore; Mac, PC, Chromebook, as long as it can run a modern browser you’re all set.</li>
  <li>The local environment is easily reproducible. If your laptop dies and you need to spin up a fresh development environment, or if you want to collaborate with others and need a fresh development environment for them, it’s one click away.</li>
  <li>Your Cloud9 instance can act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host">bastion host</a> to the rest of your infrastructure, and it’s as secure as your AWS console.</li>
</ul>

<p>That was all pretty appealing to me, so I dug in.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>As usual, Amazon’s documentation is not the friendliest. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/setting-up.html">setup guide</a> is fine enough, but after that I floundered a bit. The main problem is that, once you set up your Cloud9 environment, you’re in an IDE and it feels like you should be doing things “the Cloud9 way” in order to avoid getting bitten later. It turns out that, at least in my case, ignoring that concern is sufficient. Basically, treat the terminal the same way you’d treat any SSH session into an EC2 box that you were planning to use as a dev environment (so use package managers from the terminal, run tests there, etc) and use the file manager/editor for their basic use-cases (or just use the terminal for everything if you want!). My project is built on Lambda, and Cloud9 has some <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/lambda-functions.html">decent Lambda-specific features</a> but don’t feel that you need to use Cloud9-specific features for build/deploy steps; that is not its core use-case.</p>

<p>Ultimately Cloud9 is just a small convenience layer on top of just spinning up your own EC2 instance to use as a dev box, but the convenience is well worth it IMO. You don’t pay extra for running Cloud9 (you’re only charged for the underlying EC2/EBS infra) and the fact that Cloud9 automatically manages starting/stopping the instance for you makes it way more cost-effective than running the instance directly.</p>

The reason is that a confluence of events around 2008 provided the push to get the Mono project into mobile app development. This resulted in MonoTouch (for iOS) and Mono for Android, which eventually became Xamarin as we know it today.</i></p><p>The Mono project was founded in 2001 as a free open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET framework on Linux. But Mono had struggled since its inception to find its reason for being. According to Mono's founder, Miguel De Icaza, the hardcore free open source community never fully got behind Mono. The FOSS community feared that Microsoft would eventually cause problems for Mono, due to Microsoft being the creator of .NET.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of the Linux world however were other more pragmatic people from the MacOSX world who had no problem with Mono. One of these people was Joachim Ante, from Unity. Around 2005 the Unity game engine was just starting out and had a performance problem - their original scripting language of Python was far too slow - they needed something that was an order of magnitude faster. So Unity decided to replace the Python scripting with Mono/C# and immediately got all the performance they needed. This was the early days when the Unity Game Engine ran on MacOSX only. Mono filled the need of being a free open source JIT compiler with the modern language of C#.</p><p>Fast forward to 2008 when the iPhone App Store launched; Unity quickly set their sights on being able to compile games for the iPhone. Unity wanted to use Mono, but the additional requirement was that it had to be statically compiled for iOS, because Apple had banned the use of JIT (Just In Time) compilers in iOS Apps.</p><blockquote><i>Unity comes back to us and says “Hey, we have this product on iOS, we need .NET to be statically compiled. Can you do that?” We were like, “Oh, that’s kind of impossible. Well, let’s think about it.”<p>One of our guys, Zoltán Varga - they went and made a static compiler for .NET, and it was amazing. We gave it to Unity. At this point, Unity is probably four or five employees.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They were working at somebody’s garage. And they shipped their product for iOS, built games for iOS using this thing, this 3D tech. They were the kings of this space.</p></i>- Miguel De Icaza (Xamarin)</blockquote><p>Within a year of the iPhone App Store launch, Unity went from 4-5 employees to 80 employees. The iPhone and the App Store had launched Unity's massive growth, and along with this the Mono project had finally found its reason for being - mobile apps. The Mono developers realised there was interest in using .NET for mobile apps - so using the same tech given to Unity, they built their own product - MonoTouch, which allowed developers build native iOS apps using C#. Soon afterward, Mono turned its attention to Android and created Mono for Android.</p><p>Mobile app development was new and there were many developers who wanted to get into mobile apps but didn't really want to have to learn Objective-C and Java. So Mono now had a C# based cross platform app development platform with truly native performance. This was the killer combination that ensured Mono would take off in popularity.</p><p>The developers behind Mono founded the Xamarin company in 2011, MonoTouch became Xamarin.iOS and Mono for Android became Xamarin.Android. Xamarin was acquired by Microsoft in February 2016 and became a subsidiary of Microsoft, fully focused on the development of Xamarin's open source projects.</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/dodgy_coder"><br>Follow @dodgy_coder on Twitter</a><a href="http://www.dodgycoder.net/feeds/posts/default"><br></a></p>

		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>Learn two languages.</p>
<p>When you know just one language, you can go a long way, especially if the language is dominant. In web development, that language is javascript. In system programming it’s C. Both of these languages will be around forever, and you’ll always be able to get a job writing them.</p>
<p>You can also know one non dominant language and get pretty far, though if that is your choice, you will probably be happier at a big company with supporting infrastructure. Something like ruby for web development or go or rust for systems programming.</p>
<p>But, knowing just one language is like living in the same town all your life. You can be happy doing that, but just the exposure to life in a different city will shake you and show you that what seemed like a universal truth was actually just an assumption.</p>
<p>I cut my teeth on <a href="https://www.perl.org/">perl</a> and wrote a lot of it for my first professional job. Then I had to write some java. The first java I wrote was not idiomatic. Rather than use small custom objects, I just leveraged hashmaps and lists for my data structures. I remember one of the other engineers going over some of my code and saying “that looks a lot like perl written in java!”.</p>
<p>Specifically, learning a new language will:</p>
<ul>
<li>let you see the strengths and weaknesses of your first language</li>
<li>let you bring concepts from language number two back to your code in language number one</li>
<li>make it far easier to learn a third language, should you choose or need to do so</li>
<li>make you aware of different approaches to common problems</li>
<li>may make it easier to implement certain kinds of problems. In my experience this is often due to open source libraries that may be available for one language that aren’t for another</li>
<li>make you less passionate. This may seem like a strange benefit, but learning another way to do things often helps you realize that a programming language is just a tool, and that different tools are of course better for different things.</li>
<li>let you build a mental map to apply to the new language based on the old language. “I know that there’s a way to iterate over a list in perl, so there must be a way to do so in java.” This will also help you learn common software terms (like “iterate”) which will help you in your searching.</li>
</ul>
<p>These truths apply not just to languages, but other pieces of the software development process. Learn two of everything. Databases, frameworks, development methodologies. The increase in perspective and the ability will be worth the extra effort.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

                    <!-- Main content -->
                    <p>When sharing files, I use three main services. I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Send">Firefox Send</a> and <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files">KeybaseFS</a> to share one-off and large files with friends, and I use <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> to store some personal files, and for everything school-related (I don’t get a choice about this). For the first two services, sharing a file is as simple as calling <a href="https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend"><code>ffsend</code></a> or moving a local file into my kbfs mountpoint, and I am done. Google Drive, on the other hand, the process isn’t as easy. While some Linux distributions have Google Drive integration out of the box (I miss daily-driving <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">ChromiumOS</a>), Linux users generally have to go to <code>drive.google.com</code>, and deal with the Google Drive webapp. Not sure if this is an “only me” problem, but whenever I need to quickly make a change to a document through the webapp, It decides to stop working.</p>

<p>I really like the Keybase approach of mounting remote storage as a “network drive” on my laptop, and wanted to do something similar for Google Drive. This is where a great tool called <a href="https://rclone.org/"><code>rclone</code></a> comes in to play. Rclone is a very easy-to-use command-line application for working with cloud storage. I originally learned about it when I used to host this website on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/">DigitalOcean Spaces</a> a few years ago. Out of the box, Rclone supports <a href="https://rclone.org/#providers">many cloud providers</a>, including Google Drive!</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-rclone-for-use-with-google-drive">Setting up Rclone for use with Google Drive</h2>

<p>Now for the fun part, to get started with Rclone and Google Drive on your computer, you must first install Rclone. I am going to assume you are using a Linux-based operating system here, but with some slight tweaking, this works on BSD and Windows too!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Install Rclone with the automated installer</span>
curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | <span>sudo </span>bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once Rclone is installed, you need to hop on over to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google Cloud Developer Console</a>, and create a new project. Under the <em>ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES</em> section, search for, and enable the <code>Google Drive API</code>. This will expose an API to your Google Drive, and let programs interact with the files (if setting up multiple accounts, you only need to enable the API on one of them). Click the <em>Credentials</em> tab in the left-side panel, then <em>Create credentials</em>. This will open a panel letting you set up access to your new API.</p>

<p>With the panel open, click <em>CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN</em>, <em>External</em>, then <em>CREATE</em>. Enter <code>rclone</code> as the application name, and save it. You now have set up one of those “sign in with Google” screens for yourself. Clicking the <em>Credentials</em> tab again will bring you to an area where you can generate the needed API keys for Rclone.</p>

<p>Click <em>+ CREATE CREDENTIALS</em> at the top of the panel, and select <em>OAuth client ID</em>. Set the application type to <em>Desktop app</em>, and finally, press <em>Create</em>. You will now be shown the needed info to link Rclone to your account(s).</p>

<p><em>Note: This API project is <strong>not verified</strong> by Google.</em><br>
<em>This means that you will be greeted with a scary warning when logging in the first time. Just ignore it.</em></p>

<p>Back in the terminal, we can run <code>rclone config</code> to set up a configuration for Google Drive. You will be prompted with many options. Use the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># &gt; rclone config</span>

<span># Create a new config</span>
n<span>)</span> New remote

<span># Set a name</span>
name&gt; my_drive

<span># Choose a storage type</span>
Storage&gt; drive

<span># You will be asked for a client ID and secret. These are the strings we just generated</span>
...

<span># Set the scope to allow Rclone access to your files</span>
scope&gt; 1

<span># Select the default option for everything until asked if you want to use "auto config"</span>
<span># When asked, say yes</span>
auto_config&gt; y

<span># Set team drive to no</span>
team_drive&gt; n

<span># Verify the information, then say yes</span>
ok&gt; y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Almost done. You need to run <code>rclone ls my_drive:</code> (the colon is important). This will probably ask you to go to a link, and enable an API. Do so.</p>

<p>Your Google Drive can now be mounted by running the following (feel free to change the paths to whatever you want)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/google_drive
rclone mount my_drive: ~/google_drive --vfs-cache-mode writes
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="starting-rclone-on-boot">Starting Rclone on boot</h2>

<p>You probably don’t want to run an <code>rclone</code> command every time you start your computer. This can be solved in one of two ways</p>

<h3 id="for-i3wm-users">For i3wm users</h3>

<p>On <code>i3wm</code>, just add the following line to <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>exec</span> <span>--no-startup-id</span> rclone mount my_drive: /home/&lt;user&gt;/google_drive <span>--vfs-cache-mode</span> writes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;user&gt;</code> with your username.</em></p>

<p>Keep in mind, <code>exec</code> commands are not run when reloading <code>i3</code> with <kbd>Mod</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd>. You must log out (<kbd>Mod</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd>), and back in again.</p>

<h3 id="for-ubuntu--debian-based-users">For Ubuntu / Debian-based users</h3>

<p>In pretty much any Debian-based system, you can edit <code>/etc/rc.local</code> (using <code>sudo</code>), and add the following line right before <code>exit 0</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rclone mount my_drive: /home/&lt;user&gt;/google_drive <span>--vfs-cache-mode</span> writes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;user&gt;</code> with your username.</em></p>

<p><strong>A fully-functional markdown flavor and parser for Sphinx.</strong></p>
<p>MyST allows you to write Sphinx documentation entirely in markdown.
MyST markdown provides a markdown equivalent of the reStructuredText syntax,
meaning that you can do anything in MyST that you can do with reStructuredText.
It is an attempt to have the best of both worlds: the flexibility
and extensibility of Sphinx with the simplicity and readability of Markdown.</p>
<p>MyST has the following main features:</p>

<h2>Why MyST markdown?<a href="#why-myst-markdown" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While markdown is ubiquitous, it is not powerful enough for writing modern,
fully-featured documentation. Some flavors of markdown support features needed for this,
but there is no community standard around various syntactic choices for these features.</p>
<p>Sphinx is a documentation generation framework written in Python. It heavily-utilizes
reStructuredText syntax, which is another markup language for writing documents. In
particular, Sphinx defines two extension points that are extremely useful:
<strong><a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#rst-roles-alt" title="(in Sphinx v4.0.0+)"><span>in-line roles</span></a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#rst-directives" title="(in Sphinx v4.0.0+)"><span>block-level directives</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This project is an attempt at combining the simplicity and readability of Markdown
with the power and flexibility of reStructuredText and the Sphinx platform.</strong> It
starts with the <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark markdown specification</a>, and selectively adds a few extra
syntax pieces to utilize the most powerful parts of reStructuredText.</p>

<p>If you open any introductory machine learning textbook, you will find the idea of <strong>input scaling</strong>. It is undesirable to train a model with <strong>gradient descent</strong> with non-normalized features.</p>

<p>In this article, we will review and understand the most common normalization methods. Different methods have been introduced for different tasks and architectures. We will attempt to associate the tasks with the methods although some approaches are quite general.</p>

<h5 id="why">Why?</h5>

<p>Let’s start with an intuitive <strong>example</strong> to understand why we want normalization inside any model.</p>

<p>Imagine what will happen if the input features are lying in different ranges. Imagine that one input feature lies in the range [0,1] and another in the range [0,10000]. As a result, the model will simply ignore the first feature, given that weight is initialized in a small and close range. You don’t even need exploding gradients to occur. Yeap, that’s another problem you will face.</p>

<p>Similarly, we encounter the same issues inside the layers of deep neural networks. This concern is independent of the architecture (<strong>transformers</strong>, <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong>, <strong><a href="https://theaisummer.com/understanding-lstm/" target="_blank">recurrent neural networks</a>, <a href="https://theaisummer.com/gan-computer-vision/" target="_blank">GANs</a></strong>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we think out of the box, any intermediate layer is conceptually the same as the input layer: it accepts features and transforms them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this end, we need to develop ways to train our models more effectively. Effectiveness can be evaluated in terms of training time, performance, and stability.</p>

<p>Below you can see a graph depicting the trends in normalization methods used by different papers through time.</p>

<h3 id="notations">Notations</h3>

<p>Throughout this article,  \(N\) will be the batch size, while \(H\) refers to the height, \(W\) to the width, and \(C\) to the feature channels. The greek letter μ() refers to mean and the greek letter σ() refers to standard deviation. The batch features are \(x\) with a shape of [N, C, H, W]. For the referenced style image I use the symbol \(y\) while for the segmentation mask I use the symbol \(m\) or just mask. To recap:</p><p>

\[x,y,m \in R^{N \times C \times H \times W}\]

</p><p>Besides, we will visualize the 4D activation maps <strong>x</strong> by <strong>merging the spatial dimensions</strong>. Now we have a 3D shape that looks like this:</p>

<p>Now, we are ready!</p>

<h2 id="batch-normalization-2015">Batch normalization (2015)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Batch Normalization (BN) normalizes the mean and standard deviation <strong>for each individual feature channel/map.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, the mean and standard deviation of image features are first-order statistics. So, they relate to the <strong>global characteristics</strong> (such as the image style). In this way, we somehow blend the global characteristics. Such a strategy is effective when we want our representation to share these characteristics. This is the reason that we widely utilize BN in downstream tasks (i.e. image classification).</p>

<p>From a mathematical point of view, <strong>you can think of it as bringing the features of the image in the same range</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/normalization/batch-norm-viz.png" alt="batch-norm-viz">
<em>Image by MC.AI. It show how batch norm brings the values in a compact range. <a href="https://mc.ai/intuit-and-implement-batch-normalization/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source Image</a></em></p>

<p>Specifically, we demand from our features to follow a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. <strong>Mathematically</strong>, this can be expressed as:</p><p>

\[BN(x) = \gamma(\frac{x - \mu_(x)}{\sigma(x)}) + \beta\]

\[\mu_c(x) = \frac{1}{NHW}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{nchw}\]

\[\sigma_c(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{NHW}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{w=1}^{W} (x_{nchw} - \mu_c(x))^2 }\]

</p><p>Let’s see this operation vizually:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/normalization/batch-norm.png" alt="batch-norm">
<em>An illustration of Batch Norm.</em></p>

<p>Notably, the spatial dimensions, as well as the image batch, are averaged. This way, <strong>we concentrate our features in a compact Gaussian-like space</strong>, which is usually beneficial.</p>

<p>In fact, γ and β correspond to the <strong>trainable parameters</strong> that result in the linear/affine transformation, which is different for all channels. Specifically <strong>γ</strong>,<strong>β</strong> are <strong>vectors</strong> with the channel dimensionality. The index c denotes the per-channel mean.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can turn this <strong>option</strong> on or off in a deep learning framework such as <strong>PyTorch</strong> by setting <strong>affine = True/False</strong> in Python.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-batch-normalization">Advantages and disadvantages of using batch normalization</h5>

<p>Let’s see some <strong>advantages</strong> of BN:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>BN accelerates the training of deep neural networks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every input mini-batch we calculate different statistics. This introduces some sort of regularization. Regularization refers to any form of technique/constraint that restricts the complexity of a deep neural network during training.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every mini-batch has a different mini-distribution. We call the change between these mini-distributions <strong>Internal Covariate Shift</strong>. BN was thought to eliminate this phenomenon. Later, Santurkar et al. [7] show that this is not exactly the case why BN works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BN also has a beneficial effect on the gradient flow through the network. It <strong>reduces the dependence of gradients on the scale of the parameters or of their initial values</strong>. This allows us to use much <strong>higher learning rates</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In theory, BN makes it possible to use saturating nonlinearities by preventing the network from getting stuck, but we never use these kinds of activation functions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What about <strong>disadvantages</strong>?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inaccurate estimation of batch statistics with small batch size, which increases the model error. In tasks such as <a href="https://theaisummer.com/self-supervised-learning-videos/" target="_blank">video prediction</a>, <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Semantic_Segmentation/" target="_blank">segmentation</a> and 3D <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/" target="_blank">medical image processing</a> the batch size is usually too small. BN needs a sufficiently large batch size.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problems when batch size is varying. Example showcases are training VS inference, pretraining VS fine tuning, backbone architecture VS head.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is a point of discussion if the introduced regularization reduces the need for <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=r24KwW5qbBo&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flecture%2Fdeep-neural-network%2Funderstanding-dropout-YaGbR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dropout</a>. Recent work [7] suggests that the combination of these two methods may be superior. They also provided some <strong>insights on how and why BN works</strong>. In short, <strong>they proved that BN makes the gradients more predictive</strong>. Here is the video of their video presentation (NeuIPS 2018):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOabsYbmBRM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="synchronized-batch-normalization-2018">Synchronized Batch Normalization (2018)</h2>

<p>As the training scale went big, some adjustments to BN were necessary. The natural evolution of BN is Synchronized BN(<strong>Synch BN</strong>). <strong>Synchronized</strong> means that the mean and variance is <strong>not</strong> updated in each GPU separately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, in multi-worker setups, Synch BN indicates that the mean and standard-deviation are communicated across workers (GPUs, TPUs etc).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Credits for this module belong to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08904v1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zhang et al. [6]</a>. Let’s see the computation of mean and std as the calculation of these two sums:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}

\sigma^{2} &amp;=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(x_{i}-\mu\right)^{2}}{N} = \\

&amp;=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}}{N}-\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\right)^{2}}{N^{2}}

\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>They first calculate \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}\), and \((\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i})^{2}\) <strong>individually on each device</strong>. Then the global sums are calculated by applying the <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/prLb1MbAm8M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reduce parallel programing technique</a>. The concept of reduction in parallel processing can be grasped with this video from Udacity from the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/high-performance-computing--ud281" rel="noopener" target="_blank">parallel programming course</a>.</p>

<h2 id="layer-normalization-2016">Layer normalization (2016)</h2>

<p>In ΒΝ, the statistics are computed across the batch and the spatial dims. In contrast, in <strong>Layer Normalization</strong> (<strong>LN</strong>), the statistics (mean and variance) are <strong>computed across all channels and spatial dims</strong>. Thus, the statistics are independent of the batch. This layer was initially introduced to handle vectors (mostly the RNN outputs).</p>

<p>We can visually comprehend this with the following figure:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/normalization/layer-norm.png" alt="layer-norm">
<em>An illustration of Layer Norm.</em></p>

<p>And to be honest nobody spoke about it until the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transformers</a> paper came out. So when dealing with vectors with batch size of \(N\), you practically have 2D tensors of shape \(R^{N \times K}\).</p>

<p>Since we don’t want to be dependent on the choice of batch and it’s statistics, we normalize with the mean and variance of each vector. The math:</p><p>

\[\mu_{n}=\frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{nk}\]

\[\sigma_{n}^{2}=\frac{1}{K}

\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(x_{nk}-\mu_{n}\right)^{2}\]

\[\hat{x}_{nk}= \frac{x_{nk}-\mu_{n}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{n}^{2}+\epsilon}}, \hat{x}_{nk} \in R\]

\[\mathrm{LN}_{\gamma, \beta}\left(x_{n}\right) =\gamma \hat{x}_{n}+\beta ,x_{n} \in R^{K}\]

</p><p>Generalizing into 4D feature map tensors, we can take the mean across the spatial dimension <strong>and across all channels</strong>, as illustrated below:</p><p>

\[LN(x) = \gamma(\frac{x - \mu(x) }{\sigma(x)}) + \beta\]

\[\mu_n(x) = \frac{1}{CHW}\sum_{c=1}^{C} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{nchw}\]

\[\sigma_n(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{CHW}\sum_{c=1}^{C} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{w=1}^{W} (x_{nchw} - \mu_n(x))^2 }\]

</p><h2 id="instance-normalization-the-missing-ingredient-for-fast-stylization-2016">Instance Normalization: The Missing Ingredient for Fast Stylization (2016)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instance Normalization (IN) is computed <strong>only across the features’ spatial dimensions</strong>. So it is independent for each channel and sample.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally, we just remove the sum over \(N\) in the previous equation compared to BN. The figure below depicts the process:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/normalization/Instance%20Norm.png" alt="Instance Norm">
<em>An illustration of Instance Norm.</em></p>

<p>Surprisingly, the affine parameters in <strong>IN</strong> <strong>can completely change the style</strong> of the output image. As opposed to BN, <strong>IN can normalize the style of each individual sample to a target style</strong> (modeled by γ and β). For this reason, training a model to transfer to a specific style is easier. Because the rest of the network can focus its learning capacity on content manipulation and local details while discarding the original global ones (i.e. style information). For completeness less check the math:</p><p>

\[IN(x) = \gamma(\frac{x - \mu_(x)}{\sigma(x)}) + \beta\]

\[\mu_{nc}(x) = \frac{1}{HW} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{chw}\]

\[\sigma_{nc}(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{HW} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{w=1}^{W} (x_{nchw} - \mu_c(x))^2 }\]

</p><p>By extending this idea, by introducing a set that consists of multiple γ and β, one can design a network to model a plethora of finite styles, which is exactly the case of the so-called conditional IN [8].</p>

<p><em>Note: This article assumes that you are somewhat familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragon</a> as well as with the <a href="http://www.rosenfels.org/Joseph%20Campbell%20-%20The%20Hero%20With%20A%20Thousand%20Faces,%20Commemorative%20Edition%20%282004%29.pdf">hero's journey monomyth</a>.</em></p>
<p>Today I wish to ramble against the corruption of the greatest masterpiece of French absurdist philosophy created in the 20th century. Oddly enough, this masterpiece was not the work of WW2 era french philosophers, but of a middle-aged nerd from Illinois by the name of Gary Gygax.</p>
<h2>I - Character creation</h2>
<p>The one thing that puts "old school" DnD most at odds with modern variants, I think, is character creation.</p>
<p>Characters were created by rolling 3d6, 6 times, in a row, then they got assigned to abilities one by one.</p>
<p>To give an example, for those unfamiliar and still reading. Let's say you have 3 things that define a character:</p>
<ul>
<li>intelligence</li>
<li>perseverance</li>
<li>charisma</li>
</ul>
<p>In the "old school" RPGs one would roll 3d6 (3 six-sided dices) and add them up 3 times, say:</p>
<p>2+3+6=11, 2+2+1=5,5+5+3=13</p>
<p>Then, the order in which you rolled would be assigned, so you'd come out as someone that's intelligence=11, perserverence=5, charisma=13</p>
<p>In modern RPGs the process is closer to rolling 5d6, taking the best 3,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(sum(max3(3,5,5,2,4)) = 14</p>
</li>
<li><p>sum(max3(5,2,1,6,4)) = 15</p>
</li>
<li><p>sum(max3(5,6,1,6,2)) = 17</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then assigning them as one will, so I could have my perseverance be 17, or my intelligence, or my charisma.</p>
<p>The process is there to make sure that the player gets to play an above-average character that is constructed to fit their fantasy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Furthermore, the game masters of modern games are encouraged to hand-tailor encounters to their players. If the characters are dumb and unperceptive, it would be cruel to throw them against an impassible murder mystery. If they are physically powerful, it's fine to throw a lot of physically intimidating adversaries at them. Not too many, just enough to give the possibility of loss, but have it be so remote as to never actually happen, make the ods 1 in 1000.</p>
<p>The player characters are "Gods", not in the sense that they are all-powerful, but in the sense that the universe revolves around them. They basically cannot die, death is a rare and remarkable event, something that might happen once in years of playing. They cannot face foes that are beyond their ability to defeat, nor will they often fail at the tasks they set upon, they will just be met with challenges and setbacks.</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast with the original versions and playstyles for DnD, where lady fate controlled everything.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.boomfilosofie.nl/media/15/9789024405008.jpg" alt="https://www.boomfilosofie.nl/media/15/9789024405008.jpg"></p>
<h2>II - RPGs and heroic journeys</h2>
<p>One thing I liked about "old school" RPGs is that they break the pattern behind heroic stories. They are meant to drive at the idea of a band of friends embarking upon a heroic adventure... until the moments the dice come out the wrong way. Then it's death, scrambling, abandoning your friends, forsaking your ethical code, and ultimately an inevitable death.</p>
<p>That's not to say all games ended in death, but a lot of them did or were at least plagued by death. To have a character that survived for 20 games might have been a rare occurrence, rather than a guarantee.</p>
<p>Modern RPG, however, are hand made stories of facing adversities and succeeding. I'm sure not all GMs consciously model their plots upon the hero's journey, but most of them seem to reach some sub-par version of it in one way or another. After all, it's a monomyth for a reason.</p>
<p>In an ideal 1st edition DnD game, the person running the game would be as unwitting as the player regarding what lies one step ahead. The world would be constructed by sheer chance, based on the will of the dice. Will the guard you are about to pickpocket hold the key you need? 1/10 chance they do. How much money does the bandit warlord have? 3d10 golden coins. Will the fall break your legs and leave you unable to lead a normal life? Roll above 5 on a 10 sided dice and it might.</p>
<p>And finally, death was a great equalizer. Players and "other characters" were on similar terms regarding death. If you got hit hard enough, well, you died, much like your enemy would. Yes, there was a chance you might live and be incapacitated, but not a particularly large one, the same one that your enemy had.</p>
<p>In modern RPGs, however, death is guarded against by many walls. Mechanisms ranging from negative HP to 3, 5, or however many "death saving throws" made at odds so favorable their results almost become nonconsequential.</p>
<h2>III - Against heroic journeys</h2>
<p>The hero's journey monomyth is not necessarily healthy, it's made for another world, one more brutal and much less understood than ours. It's a potentially toxic construct that places all responsibility on the individual rather than the environment.</p>
<p>Your friend didn't help you? Guess you didn't manage to make true friends.</p>
<p>You were too dumb to pass the test? Well gosh, I guess you aren't the chosen one after all.</p>
<p>Femur got shattered in a car accident and your dreams of being a professional sportballer are now ash? Can't help you with that, a true hero would go on a journey and find a foundation of restoration.</p>
<p>That's pretty much life, it doesn't fit the hero's monomyth, neither externally nor even internally.</p>
<p>Most people don't battle mental illness to come out on top, not only recovered but even better. Most people's minds slowly degrade as they age, any conditions they might have had when young usually accentuate.</p>
<p>Whatever drugs they take to help them cause horrible side effects and leave them lacking in other areas, whatever treatments worked get worst as they age. Schizophrenia and BPD might get better as people age, but only to be replaced by dementia, Alzheimer, and Parkinson's.</p>
<p>And most risky attempts at success are just that, risky attempts. 99.999% of musicians don't even get to the "realizing their lives of fame, birds and coke are meaningless and going to India to find themselves", they are left practicing for long years with nothing to show for it, concerts at local bars, touring around nearby cities with a cover band, growing old and becoming bittered and entranced in a dying genre of music, considering suicide when they see how easily a kid with a machine can produce sounds that took them decades to master.</p>
<h2>IV - Understanding life via RPGs</h2>
<p>Old school RPGs are a perfect foil to the heroic myth.</p>
<p>It is a testament to their prowess that a DnD 2nd edition game set in a land of elves, dwarves, empires, and hidden magical artifacts... is more reflective of real-life than any modern-day novel one might pick up from a shelf. Not "reflective" in the surface level aesthetics, but rather in the internal mechanisms that lead the world, the random chance that dictates winners and losers, happiness and suffering, life and death.</p>
<p>The very chance contained within them is what makes them realistic, the fact that one must learn to enjoy a character that didn't come out perfect or a story that ended with the players failing a perception check and falling into a crevasse.</p>
<p>The "realism" here is of a kind that we could use more of, in a world where personal agency is being slowly reduced, a world with more people and fewer resources, one where most of us, for better or worst, will not be heroes.</p>
<p>Our lives are much better understood as complex absurdist tragedies, driven by nothing else but chance, or at most by the seemingly arbitrary cacophony of machinations of 8 billion other people living their own meaningless tales.</p>
<p>Which is not to say there is no beauty to be found in life, for there is. I won't go into the subject matter here, because others have done it better justice. But before we find that beauty, we must realize what life isn't, and this process is influenced by the kind of game we play, the kind of stories we tell.</p>
<p>The original game of Dungeons and Dragon is an excellent example of storytelling catching up to the modern world. Of a kind of story that doesn't prime our brains to suffer when faced with the reality of life, or to maddingly search for patterns that, if they ever existed, have been gone for a long time.</p>
<p>It is not the only example of such, I believe games like Dark Souls also do a good job at this, telling a story marked by failure and uncertainty, where "victory" is just the same cycle starting anew. A story that is fun because of the challenge, because of the unforeseen, because of the beautifully sad aesthetic appeal of an ancient and dying world, and because success tastes best when it is seldom and unexpectedly encountered.</p>
<p>However, I am saddened by what I perceive to be a corruption of Dungeons and Dragons, a rushed attempt to make a few pennies of the game by making it more popular, which might have forever ruined table tops role-playing for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>We had a shining hope for modern storytelling, something so novel and fun that could shatter the old and useless monomyth. Help new generations grow up with stories that more closely matched the workings of reality. But in the end, it got succumbed and melded with the myth, it became just a way to tell the story of the hero's journey.</p>
<p>But, alas, I guess this shouldn't sadden me, after all, it would have been foolish to expect a single good idea could shine through unhindered and change a world dictated by randomness and inertia.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The intellectual property debate is so hot these days that I can’t wander into a restroom without running across graffiti supporting one side or the other. Some people think that patents and other forms of intellectual property law are the bane of the free universe, and that these laws are not just misguided but actually evil and should be struck down as soon as possible. Others are convinced that pretty much the whole world economy is driven by intellectual property. And those people want to do anything to strengthen the legal status of IP rights. <mark>As a result, the graffiti on the issue gets quite graphic at times.</mark></p>

<p>Of course, most of it is on the virtual restrooms on the Internet, not so much the restrooms in the hotspots of San Jose’s nightlife<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
This, as anybody who lives in San Jose can tell you, is called IRONY. San Jose doesn’t have nightlife. People living here drive to San Mateo if they actually want to have fun
</span>.
There’ll be huge flamefests over some specific issue associated with intellectual property law, with people arguing everything from First Amendment rights to whether IP law might make open source development impossible sometime in the future. I find myself certifiably schizophrenic on the issue.</p>

<p>It’s not that I don’t have an opinion: I have very strong opinions on the worth of intellectual property, but they end up being on both sides of the argument. I can tell you, this can be very confusing. It means that I end up arguing both sides. And I think this is because there really are two sides to intellectual property, and they share nothing but the name.</p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property-is-not-property">Intellectual ‘Property’ is not Property</h2>

<p>To many people, including me, intellectual property is all about human inventiveness, about the very thing that makes us humans instead of animals (that, and thumbs, of course). And in that setting, the very name “intellectual property” is an affront: It’s not property to be sold like chattel, it’s the act of creation, it’s the greatest thing any human can ever do. It’s Art, with a capital A. It’s the Mona Lisa, but it’s also the end result of a long night of programming, and it’s an end result that you as a programmer are damned proud of. <mark>It’s something so precious that selling it isn’t even possible: It’s indelibly a part of who you are.</mark></p>

<p>That kind of creativity—whether it be in the form of painting, music, sculpture, writing, or programming—should be sacred. The creator and the thing he or she created have a bond that cannot be severed. It’s like the bond between a mother and child, or between bad Chinese food and MSG. But at the same time it’s something that everybody in the whole world should be able to be part of, because it is humanity.</p>

<p>And then, in the other corner, weighing in at an approximate seven gadzillion billion U.S. dollars a year, intellectual property is huge business. Human creativity got a price tag, and it turned out to be quite expensive. Creativity is rare, and as a result it is not just expensive but also extremely lucrative. Which brings in a totally different class of arguments, and totally different kinds of people. The kind of people who call the end result of human creativity “property.” Not to mention, of course, lawyers.</p>

<p>Read the title of this paper again. The “property” people are winning. After all, their name stuck. So what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The most well-known example of intellectual property is the notion of copyright. Copyrights are basically the codification of the rights of any creator to do with his or her creation as he or she wishes. The “owner” of the creation can decide on how that creation should be used.</p>

<p>Copyrights are also legally very simple to get. You don’t have to register your copyright: You are automatically the copyright holder of whatever creative work you do. This is an important distinction from most other intellectual property law, mainly because it actually makes it easy for individuals, not just big corporations, to own copyrights. You can own a copyright, simply by virtue of writing, painting, or generally creating something unique. If you want to, you can add a legend like “(C) Copyright 2000 Yourname Here,” but quite frankly, you don’t need to. You own the copyright whether you say so or not. Saying so just makes it easier for other people to track you down if they want to use your work.</p>

<p>Of course, just owning a copyright in itself is not very useful. But the fact that you own what you create means that you can control how it is used. You have, for example, the right to sell such a work of art to somebody else, and nobody but the IRS gets to have any say in the matter. But it’s about more than just the money, and that’s where a lot of people seem to find themselves flummoxed.</p>

<p>For example, you can use your power as owner of a copyright to try to do more interesting things than just sell it. You can license it. This is even better than selling it; <mark>instead of selling the work of art you can sell the license to do certain things to it, and still retain the copyright on it. Basically, you can have your cake and eat it, too.</mark> This is how the Microsofts of the world get created: endlessly selling the rights to use something, without actually losing anything. No wonder people just love to own this kind of property.</p>

<h2 id="problems-of-treating-ip-as-property">Problems of Treating IP as Property</h2>

<p>Does anybody perhaps start to see a problem here? If you don’t see anything strange so far, I have a bridge and a few pieces of waterfront property to sell you.</p>

<p>The basic problem with intellectual property is starting to show itself: You as the owner of intellectual property can effectively sell it forever, without ever losing anything yourself. You don’t risk anything, and in fact you might decide to write your license in a way that basically says that even if the property is flawed, you cannot be held responsible in any way. Sounds preposterous? You’d be surprised. So, intellectual property offers no consumer protection.</p>

<p>It gets worse. The copyright holder not only has the right to sell his or her property without losing it, but also the right to sue people who sell property that looks like his or hers. Clearly the copyright owner has rights over that derived work. <em>Clearly</em>? Not so fast.</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line between inspiration and copying? And what happens when different people come up with similar ideas? Who gets the gravy train of being able to sell his idea over and over and over again, and gets to tell the other people to butt out of his business? <mark>It’s not just consumers who aren’t protected, it’s also other creative people who are not protected by the notion of “intellectual property.”</mark></p>

<p>What makes the discussion ugly at this point is that a lot of the arguments for stronger intellectual property rights are based on the notion of giving inventors and artists more “protection.” What people don’t seem to ever realize is that giving such powerful rights to some people also ends up taking rights away from others.</p>

<p>And maybe not so surprisingly, the proponents of stricter intellectual property laws are the organizations that stand to gain the most. Not the artists and inventors themselves, but the clearinghouses of IP: companies that make a living off other people’s creativity. Oh, and lawyers, of course. The end result? Copyright law amendments like the infamous Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which removes the last vestiges of consumer rights over the use of copyrighted material.</p>

<p>Now, if you are getting the notion that I think copyrights are actually detrimental, you’re wrong. I happen to absolutely love copyrights, I just don’t believe in taking the rights of the authors too far. Not to the point of screwing the consumer over. And I say this not just as a consumer, but as a producer of copyrighted material myself, both in the form of this book and of Linux itself.</p>

<p><mark>I, as a copyright holder, have my rights. But with rights come obligations—or as they say in certain neighborhoods, <em>noblesse oblige</em>.</mark> And so I have the obligation to use those rights in responsible ways, and not as a weapon against others who lack such rights. As one great American once declared, “Ask not what your copyright can do for you, ask what you can do for your copyright”—or something to that effect.</p>

<h2 id="patents-make-the-problem-uglier">Patents Make the Problem Uglier</h2>

<p>Copyright is, despite even the DMCA, a fairly mild and well-behaved form of intellectual property. The notion of “fair use” does still exist, and holding a copyright does not give all rights to the work to the copyright holder.</p>

<p>The same cannot be said for patents, trademarks, and trade secrets; the heavy drugs of IP. Discussions over software patents in particular have gotten so inflamed in technical circles that it officially counts as one of the subjects you should not discuss in polite company, along with gun control, abortion rights, medical marijuana, and whether Pepsi tastes better than Coca Cola. And the reason is that patents, in many ways, give control over new inventions similar to that of copyrights, but with few of the redeeming qualities of copyrights.</p>

<p>One of the most awkward issues with patents is that, unlike with copyrights, you don’t get a patent just for inventing something new. No, <mark>you get a patent after you’ve gone through the painful and prolonged process of filing for it with the patent office.</mark> Waiting for the patent office, by the way, is a bit like standing in line at the DMV, but you have to realize that you stand in line with about twelve patent lawyers, and the line is …</p></section></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>To compliment the recent publication of my <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/hveprom-project/an-easy-to-build-mcs-48-8748-8749-8741-8742-8048-8049-programmer-reader/">MCS-48 programmer shield</a>, I thought it’d be interesting to build something useful based on one of these. Completed in 1976, the MCS-48 is 44 years old at the time of writing this article, giving us an opportunity to venture back into the distant past of embedded development, peeling away the many layers of hardware and software we typically float atop of on the likes of Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-711x800.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-711x800.jpg 711w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-267x300.jpg 267w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-133x150.jpg 133w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-768x864.jpg 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-1365x1536.jpg 1365w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-1820x2048.jpg 1820w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px"></a></figure>



<p>With the prospect of building ones own gizmo based on the very first microcontroller – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS1000">TMS1000</a> hovering just <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/02/18/the-tms1000-the-first-commercially-available-microcontroller/">a hair above zero</a>, the MCS-48 offers us a decent consolation.</p>



<p>Unlike the almost equally ancient MCS-51 which refuses to die, industry decided to leave MCS-48 in the past. When looking at the details, it looks likely that the efforts of the MCS-48 project went into the MCS-51, however the two have neither instruction set, or pin compatibility. As such, MCS-48 does not have any modern descendants or tooling. With such a limited instruction set and no data stack, writing 3GL compilers for it would have been challenging, and resulting code would have been very wasteful of its limited resources.</p>



<p>The market for assembly language only microcontrollers contracted by the 1990s, by which point MCS-51 had taken its place, providing a full instruction set capable of supporting higher level language compilers. I was told by a friend that despite a movement towards C development, some engineers continued to pour over reams of MCS-48/51 assembly listings printed on green-bar well into the 1990s.</p>



<p>For a microcontroller with only GPIOs a single timer, 1K of program space and 64 bytes of data memory (32 depending on how you count it), it can be a bit of a stretch to think of something useful to do with it. This dual temperature sensor doesn’t need anything more, and it’s something I could just about bear the thought of programming in its assembler language, as there is not any other choice.</p>



<h2>Software development</h2>



<p>As I hinted to earlier, there is no C compiler for MCS-48, making writing software for these devices challenging. It is stated on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/M">Wikipedia </a>that a PL/M compiler was available for these however I was unable find it or any other mention. To add to the pain, there’s no hardware multiply, divide or subtract either. There <em>isn’t even</em> an instruction for comparing two numbers. All of this has to be pieced together with primitive logic instructions. As I worked my way through the implementation, I kept telling myself it would get easier. It didn’t.</p>



<p>Even being equipped with a <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/16702b/">proper logic analyser</a>, using modern PCs, editors and a very easy to use programmer, writing the software for this was still very difficult. It took me nearly three weeks to complete it, whereas an 8051 version (C/Keil implementation) of this same project I completed 7 years earlier was completed in under two days.</p>

Same functionality, similar hardware design, but software was written in C and built with Keil. Not as cool as this project.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I cheated a little by using a modern enthusiast-built assembler – <a href="http://asm48.sourceforge.net/">ASM48 </a>for this project.</p>



<p>Back in 1977, when these were first purchasable, there were no PCs or DOS  to write the software on. A purpose built machine, the Intel MDS-II (microprocessor development platform) with an assembler also from Intel was used. Some scanned manuals I’ve found show that the assembler outputs the following version string:</p>



<pre>ISIS-II MCS-48/UPI-41 MACRO ASSEMBLER, V3.0</pre>



<p>This may be a copy of it <a href="https://github.com/ogdenpm/intel80tools/tree/master/itools/asm48/3.0">here</a>. The MDS-II ran a special operating system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS_(operating_system)">ISIS-II</a>. It is suspected (although not confirmed) that IBM developed the original PC BIOS on one of these machines too (<em>they certainly did not develop it on a PC</em>), there is an interesting thread about that <a href="http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-ibm-pc-bios-and-intel-isis-ii/">here</a>, which details the challenges of recovering these early development tools.</p>



<p>You can see the MDS-II pictured in the image below (blue, on the left).</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://p112.sourceforge.net/index.php?isx">simulator</a> for the ISIS-II platform. A potential interesting re-visit for the future.</p>



<h2>Programming an MCS-48</h2>



<p>Internal EPROM MCS-48’s cannot be programmed in standard EPROM programmers. They require a specially designed programmer. Hardware is still obtainable for however not particularly cheap. I went to the trouble of building my own programmer, in the form of an <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/hveprom-project/an-easy-to-build-mcs-48-8748-8749-8741-8742-8048-8049-programmer-reader/">Arduino shield</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the programmer, an EPROM eraser is also required. Mine is a classic design from the 1980s however there are plenty of cheapy Chinese units for sale on eBay these days.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>



<p>Typical debug techniques used on modern microcontrollers, for example printf() or in-circuit debugging are out of the question. An emulator would have been of little practical use as these devices almost always needed to be debugged in-situ.</p>



<p>Assuming you weren’t building a product that could be physically damaged by stopping the processor, the “austere” approach recommended by the databook is to use a romless version with a single step circuit, combined with the SS (single step) pin to step through your code with an external logic analyser attached to an external EPROMs address/data signals.</p>



<p>With this you can see what the program counter is up to, but you have no idea what any of the registers inside the CPU contain. If you need to see one of those, you have to copy it into the accumulator, then write it out onto the bus, assuming that doing so didn’t cause some kind of catastrophe, then capturing it with a logic analyser.</p>



<figure><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48.png" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48.png 679w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48-300x187.png 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48-150x93.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px"><figcaption>Intellec MDS and Intel ICE-48 simulator</figcaption></figure>



<p>Well equipped engineers of the day may have been in possession of one of the above. The ICE-48 simulator was connected in place of a 40 pin MCS-48, allowing engineers to view the contents of internal registers, set breakpoints and single step. Quite a luxury compared with my experiences.</p>



<p>I found that the <em>easiest way</em> to debug an MCS-48 is to <strong>not debug it at all</strong>. Instead I repeatedly ran the instructions through in my head over and over again, and tried to get it right first time. <em>This is a lot less time consuming that any other approach</em>.</p>



<h2>A little joke, at my expense</h2>



<p>At the outset of this project I purchased an MCS-48 databook off eBay (I just wanted to have one). What I received was the original 1976 edition, which, <strong>has errors in it</strong>. <em>Damned eBay rubbish strikes again</em>.</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-800x465.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-800x465.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-300x174.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-150x87.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-768x447.jpg 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-1536x893.jpg 1536w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror.jpg 1849w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption>The incorrect pinout for the MCS-48</figcaption></figure>



<p>Above is the stated MCS-48 pinout, which is incorrect. The RD/WR pins are shown swapped. My first revision of the schematic included this mistake, because I worked from this book. This lead to a lot of head scratching when I first attempted to debug it on my logic analyser.</p>



<h2>Taming the Quasi-Bidirectional GPIO</h2>



<p>On modern microcontrollers GPIOs are easy. We have register which can enable a pair of P/Nch FETs for use as an output, typically being able to sink and source a fairly decent amount of current, usually enough to power LEDs and small relays for example.</p>



<p>On the MCS-48, we are lumbered with the quasi-bidirectional GPIO. The databook makes a lot of how wonderful and innovative these are but from the perspective of having used modern ‘true’ GPIOs – they are a pain in the backside. </p>



<figure><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1.png" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1.png 779w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1-300x191.png 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1-150x96.png 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px"><figcaption><em>The schematic for the pin of each GPIO on an MCS-48</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Essentially these are both an input and an output at the same time. The input part is simply a buffer which is always sampling the external pin, and the output part is an N-ch FET which pulls the pin low, with an internal 50K pull-up providing the logic “high”. There is also a puny P-ch FET with an impedance of 5K which is asserted for one clock cycle to give a good rise time, but after that we’re hanging entirely off the 50K pull-up, which isn’t going to allow us to source enough current to do anything useful without buffering.</p>



<p>Why not just leave a 5K pull-up in circuit all the time? Because the design would be condemned to wasting a significant amount of power continuously where outputs are held low. You <em>could</em> put a strong pull-up to allow sourcing of a larger amount of current, but then you hit another problem in that the N-ch FET has an impedance of 300Ω so if the pull-up was 1K, you would end up with a 1.15V “low” voltage. Not ideal.</p>



<p>The characteristics of these pins lend themselves rather well to driving FETs. The 5K pull-up “pulse” means the gate will charge quickly, and the 50K will keep it charged. The 300Ω low side also works well. In this day and age getting large drive current from the GPIO on an MCS-48 (and MCS-51) is simply a case of slapping a MOSFET of the desired polarity straight onto the pin (you could add a gate resistor to reduce ringing, but not likely needed).</p>



<p>Not something that would have been done back in the day (transistors and carefully calculated base resistors would have been used) but is exactly what I’ve done in my design. As is stated repeatedly in the databook, these pins are able to drive the inputs of other TTL logic no problems, something also found on my design.</p>



<h2>ROM Variations</h2>



<p>Unlike the TMS1000 which was masked-ROM only, the MCS-48 came in a cornucopia of different ROM options and sizes.</p>



<p>I have often seen it stated that the 8048/8049 variants were “OTP” (one-time programmable). This is (sort-of) true. They were actually mask ROM programmed.</p>



<p>The code for masked ROMs for these devices was supplied to Intel by customers on punched-cards. The databook explains how these are to be formatted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Following the BoF on power consumption of software Cornelius chaired at
<a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/09/15/kde-akademy-2020-recap.html">Akademy 2020</a> I did
look a bit into tooling for that, in particular for cheap ways to measure electrical power
consumption. Here are the results so far.</p>

<h3 id="why-measure-electrical-power-consumption">Why measure electrical power consumption?</h3>

<p>Our existing profiling tools for improving software performance implicitly also identify parts
that presumably increase the power consumption, and we do have specialized tools like <code>powertop</code> that
are good at identifying specific types of power drains. But not everything is visible in there,
e.g. CPU/GPU trade-offs, or the actual effects of power management options or display settings.</p>

<p>So being able to measure the actual power consumption between the wall plug and the full device seems
useful, to the very least to verify that assumptions we make from other profiling tools actually hold.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Measuring electrical power isn’t exactly an unsolved problem, even if it’s not entirely trivial when
looking at the combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">alternating current</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply#Power_factor">switching power supplies</a>.
However, it’s not straightforward to find a solution when adding all our desired constraints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work with a wide range of devices to measure without requiring modifications, and covering the total
power consumption, ideally something you just connect to the power plug and the wall socket.</li>
  <li>High time resolution: Power consumption of computing hardware can change very very rapidly, averaging
over a long time period might thus hide information relevant for us.</li>
  <li>Cheap: To actually make an impact, I think we need to spread the equipment widely in the community,
and that’s much more likely with tools that cost 10€ rather than a few k€.</li>
  <li>Easy and safe to operate for people without an electrical engineering background: Same as the above, that should
help spreading the tools widely.</li>
  <li>Bonus: Machine readable measurement data. That could allow us to build further software tools on top of this,
such as test automation or CI integration for checking for power regressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding a solution that covers some of those requirements isn’t particularly hard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you compromise on price, there’s beautiful professional equipment for this.</li>
  <li>If you compromise on time resolution, there’s reasonably accurate devices sold
for about 10€ in every hardware store as e.g. “energy monitor”, typically with a small
LCD screen showing the accumulated electricity use over a period of time.</li>
  <li>If you compromise on safety (or at least accept considerable effort to achieve safety),
the necessary sensors to build a DIY measurement device only cost a few Euros.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="repurposing-a-wifi-power-plug">Repurposing a Wifi power plug</h3>

<p>While preparing the office at work for full remote operations earlier this year I came across a type of devices that seemed
to check all those boxes though: A Wifi-controlled power plug capable of running a Free Software firmware and an integrated
power sensor.</p>

<p>To try this I got myself a few <a href="https://templates.blakadder.com/gosund_SP111_v2.html">Gosund SP111</a> for about 8€ a piece,
and replaced their firmware with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs">Tasmota</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/tasmota/docs/blob/development/docs/devices/BlitzWolf-SHP6.md">manual flashing instructions</a> might look
a bit scary, but thanks to “opportunities” in their stock firmware this can also be done conveniently over the air using
<a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert">tuya-convert</a>. Following the Docker-based approach in their
instructions made this work on first try without any issues for me. Out of the box this was already showing power measurements in its
web UI, with an update interval of a few seconds.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/67/tasmotized-gosund-sp111.jpg" alt="Picture of two Gosund SP111 Wifi power plugs and a screenshot of the Tasmota web interface running on it.">
  
  <figcaption>Gosund SP111 Wifi power plug and the Tasmota web interface running on it.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The initial values were not at all plausible though, going through the
<a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Power-Monitoring-Calibration/">power calibration procedure</a> helped with that.
Reading out measurements automatically is possible via MQTT, so that’s covered as well.</p>

<p>At this point I was reading through the firmware code, assuming it would need adjustments to allow higher sample rates,
but it turns out we can get this down to 200ms by just sending the right MQTT commands. The two following crude scripts running
in parallel produce a CSV stream with the various measurement values.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/VoltRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"3"</span>
mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/AmpRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"3"</span>
mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/PowerRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"5"</span>

<span>while </span><span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>do
    </span>usleep 200000
    mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/STATUS"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"10"</span>
<span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This sets the device to report measurements in the highest available resolution, and then polls in a 200ms interval. The
results are received and unpacked by the next script. Its output is CSV that can be redirected as needed.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> <span>"Time;Voltage;Current;Power;Apparent Power;Reactive Power;Factor"</span>

<span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="visualizing-measurements">Visualizing measurements</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of ways to process the CSV data, a real-time view turned out to be quite useful though. As the data
can be rather noisy a basic smoothing filter also helps to make things easier to read.</p>

<p>KDE’s <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/">LabPlot</a> can consume CSV “streams” and has the right filters for this. Unfortunately
its filters cannot be applied in realtime yet, so the LapPlot team pointed me to a much older KDE application that can do this:
<a href="https://github.com/Kst-plot/kst">Kst</a>. It’s filters are frequency-based, so we need a low-pass filter to smooth the
measurements. Not as nice as what LabPlot produces IMHO, but it gets the job done.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<p>Good news first: This is sensitive enough to see the impact of simple user interactions, power saving options
(ie. the Good/Bad toggles in <code>powertop</code>), display brightness changes, etc.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/67/power-usage-while-moving-mouse-cursor.png" alt="Plot of an example measurement showing power over time.">
  
  <figcaption>Example measurement (200ms sample interval, no filter): mouse cursor being moved between samples 100 and 150, with a peak while hovering a task bar entry.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How good this is, ie. how close the reported values get to reality, and to what extend the noise is inherent to the sensor
I have no idea though, lacking a calibrated reference to compare this to. Based on suggestions found online on how to reduce the
noise by hardware modifications I have to assume most of that is coming from the sensor.</p>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of things to further investigate here still, both regarding assessing and improving the quality and resolution
of the measurements (e.g. by looking into increasing the sampling frequency by modifying the Tasmota firmware, assuming that is even
useful), and regarding establishing the power impact of software settings or options.</p>

<p>While not doing work that we don’t need to do is of course better either way, there are many less obvious questions to investigate
with this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can we enable more of the power management options exposed by <code>powertop</code> by default? There’s probably good reasons why they are off,
but maybe that selection can be done more targeted? Or if it’s about user-decided trade-offs, maybe that can be made easier accessible
for more users?</li>
  <li>How do operations on the CPU and GPU compare, or different ways of accessing the GPU? Thinking about the various compositor settings here for example.</li>
  <li>How do we best perform long-running background tasks? As fast as possible with all available resources, or stretched out over time?</li>
  <li>Can we somehow make automatic screen brightness control more clever, e.g. by improving idle or presence detection?</li>
  <li>Can we save power by making a dark color scheme the default on OLED screens?</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just scratching the surface I guess.</p>

<p>As I didn’t break any of the Wifi power-plugs during these experiments, I still have two spares I can pass to anyone in the community
interested in digging into this as well!</p>

<p><span>You might start thinking that nothing grows forever and the economic cycle is dead. Soon after, you</span><span> abandon your long-term mindset, sell off all your stocks, and turn your paper losses into real ones.</span><span><br>

<h2><strong>My response is:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span>Structures built by the wealthy (like the stock market) are a lot more resilient than you might think. At any of the little dips someone probably said the same thing.
</span></span></span></li>
<li><span>Even if what you say is</span><b> possibly </b><span>true, then what is the alternative? Not to invest? We know inflation is going to fuck your money up.<a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2020/02/07/invest-or-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Pick a </a></span><a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2020/02/07/invest-or-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>possible</b></a><span><span><span><a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2020/02/07/invest-or-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> failure over a certain failure.</a><br>
</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span>In the event where all the wealth in the stock market goes to shit, I have absolute confidence in the ability for investors to rebuild their life vs someone who didn’t invest.</span></span>If you’re someone with an investing mindset, you’re more likely to have the qualities to succeed in life&nbsp; – delayed gratification, discipline etc etc</li>
<li><em>Even in the unlikely event that one MAJOR economy fails – like the US – someone else will step up and replace them. This could be China in the future, but things remain to be seen.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>That’s what we believe in, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span>The day our money in <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> or <strong>MSCI World Index</strong> is worth <strong>0</strong>, would be the day capitalism stops existing.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>That type of upheaval would also mean you should start working on another set of skills, like </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Start-A-Fire-1/"><span>starting a fire</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-quarters_combat"><span>close quarters combat </span></a><span>and removing your scent to avoid being found by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(dog)"><span>tracker dogs</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most Singaporeans won’t survive a scenario like that anyway, so let’s talk about how you can ride out the</span><b> conventional recession</b><span> instead – by building your holding power.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Holding power is how long you can hold on to your investments without selling them. People always fuss about what companies to buy, whether or not to use a robo-advisor or which broker to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nobody talks about holding power because it’s not sexy – until it is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A wealthy person looks at the recession and <a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/11/08/recessions-are-like-winter-winter-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sees opportunity</a>, knowing it’s part of how the universe works. A poor person looks at the recession and sees hell and uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have enough holding power, you can ride out any crisis and it will be business as usual, <a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/10/25/why-im-shamelessly-downgrading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no change in lifestyle</a>.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>But if you don’t, be prepared to lose sleep, cancel your holidays, and lose all your investments and sell your home at a loss.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thankfully, both the Great Financial Crisis and Asian Financial Crisis took about two years, six months to blow over and for economies to start their recovery.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>We don’t know how long the next crisis will last, so let’s round that up to <strong>two years</strong>.<em> (But if you want to be really, really safe, there is no fault in prepping for a longer duration)</em></span></p>
<p><span>Now, this is the time you need your emergency savings to last – you don’t have control over the global economy, but you can manage how long you can stay afloat.</span></p>

<h2><b>How can my savings last two years?</b></h2>
<p><span>Remember when we nagged you to have <a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/07/13/what-most-20-somethings-dont-get-about-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six months of income</a> before you started invest?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is exactly why.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you spent 50% of your salary as expenses, six months of income could be stretched out to a year. Not too shabby. That’s 365 days before you have to lose money. Pretty good.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But if you spent 20% of your salary, then this amount will last you, far, far, longer.</span></p>
<p><span>If you <a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/06/08/why-i-choose-to-cycle-to-work-everyday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cycled to work</a> instead of getting a car, your holding power would be further extended.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you had an <a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/06/13/if-i-could-replan-my-wedding-heres-what-id-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">affordable wedding</a> instead of an expensive one, you’d have less debt to deal with.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>If you’re used to one big holiday a year <a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/06/08/how-you-can-save-money-while-travelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instead of many small ones</a>, then skipping one this year will be painless. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>If you had bought a house t<a href="https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/08/14/common-singaporean-saving-goals-ranked-by-feasibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hat was within your affordability</a>, you’d be able to easily hang on to it.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>Do you see where I’m getting at?&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span>These are all topics we’ve all written about before – being a Woke Salaryman prepares you for recession. It demands sacrifices of you during peacetime, so when a recession comes, you can easily weather the storm.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>F# is a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>&nbsp;language that compiles to .NET Intermediate Language (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language">IL)</a>. C# is becoming a more functional programming language. The latest version of C# (9) has&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9">new features</a>&nbsp;that make functional programming more accessible. The good news is that because both languages compile to IL, we can use them interchangeably. We can reference F# projects in C# projects and vice versa. Also, with the use of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dotfornet/dnSPy">dnSpy</a>, we can convert IL to C#. This article explains how to compile an F# assembly (IL) and then reference it in C# or convert it to C#. It gives C# programmers the rich feature set of F# without having to port all of the code.</p>

<h2>What is Functional Programming?</h2>



<p>The Wikipedia text explains it well.</p>



<blockquote><p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program.</p><p>In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.&nbsp;</p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>We usually divide languages into two categories: functional and imperative. The imperative approach focuses on supplying step by step instructions in loops, while functional languages rely on expressions and the concept of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher order functions</a>&nbsp;for a more declarative style. We usually call C# an imperative language and F# a functional language, but you should understand that neither language is purely functional or imperative, and both have imperative and functional constructs. So, it can be misleading to categorize either of them. In C#, you are free to mix and match the approaches. Purists would argue that mixing the approaches is a bad idea, but you’re probably already using some C# functional constructs, as you will see. It’s up to you and your team to decide how much of a functional approach you take with C# code.</p>



<h2>Higher-order Functions</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, a higher-order function is a function that accepts one or more functions as a parameter or returns a function. If you’ve used LINQ lamdas in C#, you’ve probably used higher-order functions. For example,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.where">Enumerable.Where</a>&nbsp;is a higher-order function. It takes a function as a parameter. You can hold a function as a variable and pass the function to the Where method. For example, this method returns only strings that have a length of one character.</p>







<p>The important part above is that we created a function inside a function, and we bound the function to the name predicate. We call these&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/introduction-to-functional-programming/first-class-functions" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-class functions</a>&nbsp;because we treat the functions like any other data type.</p>



<p>This is only one aspect of functional programming. Functional programming is an entire paradigm that encourages programmers to approach programming in a completely different manner. F# strongly encourages functional programming from the ground up. On the other hand, C# is a flexible language that allows functional, imperative, and object-oriented constructs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Expressions Vs. Statements</h2>



<p>In a nutshell, functional programming uses expressions, while imperative programming uses statements. Statements tell the compiler what to do step by step, while expressions return values without necessarily requiring sequential definition. Consider these two C# methods. Both achieve the same result, but the method that uses statements is much more explicit and verbose about what it is doing.</p>











<p>Expressions in F# are exquisite, and C# borrows constructs from it. The elegance of F# expressions may be a good reason to build some of your code in F#. SQL maps to F#&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/query-expressions">Query expressions</a>&nbsp;very quickly.</p>







<h2>Immutability</h2>



<p>Another key concept in the functional programming world is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/introduction-to-functional-programming/#immutability" rel="noreferrer noopener">immutability</a>. Essentially, it means that after we construct a variable, it’s data should not change. More importantly, the language or runtime should provide tools to ensure that the data does not change. We use record types in C# and F# for this purpose and immutable lists for data collections. Records accept their values during construction and do not provide a mechanism for changing the data after construction.</p>



<p>Here is an example of a record in F#. Very simply, this type accepts three ints as constructor parameters, and you cannot change these values after construction.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">type Point = { X: int; Y: int; Z: int; }</pre>



<p>This is the usage in F#.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">let point = { X = 1; Y = 2; Z = 3; }</pre>



<p>This is the usage in C#. Yes, you can directly use these types from C#.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">var point = new FSharpLibrary.Point(1, 2, 3);</pre>



<p>C# 9 adds&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#record-types" rel="noreferrer noopener">record types</a>. This is an example of a record in C#:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public record CsharpPoint(int X, int Y, int Z);</pre>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">var csharpPoint = new CsharpPoint(1, 2, 3);</pre>



<p>While C# has had higher-order functions since the early days, adding immutability with record types is a clear sign that the language designers are deliberately adding more functional constructs to the language. C# will likely evolve in this direction, and C# programmers will probably need to learn more about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@naveenrtr/introduction-to-functional-programming-with-c-b167f15221e1" rel="noreferrer noopener">functional programming</a>.</p>



<h2>F# Lists</h2>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/lists" rel="noreferrer noopener">F# lists</a>&nbsp;are immutable by default. You cannot add or remove items from the list without constructing a new list. You can use F#’s immutable lists in C# directly. You don’t even need to add an F# project. To use F# lists in C#, add the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/" rel="noreferrer noopener">FSharp.Core Nuget package</a>&nbsp;to your C# project. Here is an example C# console app.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Output</p>



<p>1, 2, 3</p>



<p>Note: the C# standard for immutable lists is ImmutableList. You can read about immutable collections in C#&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/march/net-framework-immutable-collections" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. It is part of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Collections.Immutable/" rel="noreferrer noopener">System.Collections.Immutable</a>&nbsp;NuGet package.</p>



<h2>Discriminated Unions</h2>



<p>Discriminated unions are similar to inheritance in object oriented programming. Here is an example in F#.</p>











<p>You can directly use this in C#</p>











<p>See you can see it in the sample repo <a href="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Samples/blob/f4b251014f5f5e31cf819e899127f3c7df1ce796/F%23/FSharpFromCSharp/FSharpFromCSharp/Program.cs#L22" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Samples/blob/f4b251014f5f5e31cf819e899127f3c7df1ce796/F%23/FSharpFromCSharp/FSharpFromCSharp/Program.cs#L22">here</a>.</p>



<h2>How to Reference F# Code in C#</h2>



<p>Compiled F# assemblies are basically the same as C# assemblies. The only difference is that F# assemblies, by default, depend on the library FSharp.Core. It’s just a NuGet package that you can reference from C#. You can grab this sample <a href="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Samples/tree/master/F%23/FSharpFromCSharp" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Samples/tree/master/F%23/FSharpFromCSharp">here</a>.</p>



<p>Firstly, check that you have the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/fsharp-visual-studio?view=vs-2019">F# tools</a>&nbsp;installed. You probably do.</p>



<p>Create an F# .NET class library&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How to Convert F# to C#</h2>



<p>F# compiles to .NET IL, and you can use dnSpy to convert IL to C#. This is great for two reasons. Firstly, F# is completely transparent. You don’t need to guess what it is doing. You can look at the C# version and see how it works. Secondly, you could use compiled F# code as a cookie-cutter for C# code. You might find yourself in a situation where you want to build functional code with F#, but you cannot use F# in your team. In this case, you can write the F# and drag the resulting C# into your project.</p>



<ul><li>Download and install dnSpy. This is a great tool that you should be using to inspect code inside .NET DLLs</li><li>Compile your F# project</li><li>Open the compiled assembly in the bin folder in dnSpy</li><li>You will see the structure of the IL converted to C#</li><li>You can directly copy and paste this code into a C# project or export all the code as C#.</li></ul>



<p>This is what the F# Point record type looks like when opened in dnSpy and converted to C#</p>

<p>Click on these images to see all the code. Take some time to compare C# records to F# records. It’s important to understand that both languages hide some complexity and you won’t necessarily know about it.</p>



<h2>Does this mean F# is Unnecessary?</h2>



<p>No. F# is an awesome language. As you can see, it’s far less verbose to write functional-style code in F# than C#. It’s so straight forward that anyone who understands C# can start using it without knowing anything about the language. If you are already writing functional style C# code, you will probably write a lot less code by moving chunks to F#.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Mixing and Matching</h2>



<p>F# is a more opinionated language than C#. As you can see, it hides a lot of the complexity of the types that we see in C#. There is also a lot of duplication between C# and F#. F#’s lists are not the same as immutable lists in System.Collections.Immutable and records are not the same under the hood, either. So, is it safe to use F# types in C#?</p>



<p>The answer depends on your project and your team. Transparency is essential because F# types may not behave expectedly. C# developers may get caught out in their subtle differences. If you use F# types, make sure that your team agrees to this, and this is well understood. Don’t use F# types unnecessarily. For example, you will probably have less trouble with C# records than F# records in C#. But, if you build an entire library with F#, there is no reason you can’t leverage this with C#. Also, there is no reason why you cannot use libraries like System.Collections.Immutable in F# so that immutable lists are compatible with C#.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, communication is key. Don’t be the person who sits in a corner doing weird stuff only to get called into an office to explain what a monad is because nobody else has heard of it before. Use them if they make your development life …</p></div></div>

The same thing happens when cleaning your data, it’s filtering what we want and removing what we don’t want to make the raw data useful and not raw anymore. You can do the cleaning with Python, R, or whatever language you prefer but in this tutorial, I’m going to explain how you can clean your text files at the command line &nbsp;files by giving insights from a paper researching clickbait and non-clickbait data.</p><p>This tutorial is mainly motivated by <a href="https://amzn.to/33y5EkR">Data Science at the Command Line</a></p><h6>Disclosure: <em>The two Amazon links for the book (in this section) are paid links so if you buy the book, I will have a small commission</em></h6><p>This book tries to catch your attention on the ability of the command line when you do data science tasks - meaning you can obtain your data, manipulate it, explore it, and make your prediction on it using the command line. If you are a data scientist, aspiring to be, or want to know more about it, I&nbsp;highly recommend this book. You can read it online for free from <a href="https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/">its website</a> or order an <a href="https://amzn.to/33y5EkR">ebook or paperback</a>.&nbsp;In this tutorial we're gonna focus on using the command line to clean our data.</p><h2>Pulling and running the docker image</h2><p>To remove the hassle of downloading files we deal with and dependencies we need, I've made a docker image for you that has all you need. You just pull it from docker hub and you'll find what you need to play with to let you focus on the cleaning part.&nbsp;So let's<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ezzeddin/clean-data"> pull that image</a> and then run it interactively to enter the shell and write some command-lines.</p><div><pre>$ docker pull ezzeddin/clean-data
$ docker run --rm -it ezzeddin/clean-data

</pre></div><p><strong>head clickbait_data </strong>is used here because we're doing statistics here on the couple of headlines at the top of the file which is piped to the next grep command <strong>grep -oE '\w{3,}'</strong></p><p><strong>grep </strong></p><p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-oE -o </strong>for getting only matching words and <strong>-E </strong>for using extended regular expression which is the next pattern</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\w{3,}' </strong>this pattern is like <strong>'\w\w\w+' </strong>which matches whole words with 3 letters or more</p><p>In order to get the counts of each word we need to first get the unique words which we can get by <strong>uniq </strong>command with the option <strong>-c </strong>to give you counts, but to let <strong>uniq &nbsp;</strong>delete duplicate words you need to sort first:</p><div><pre>$ head clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c

</pre></div><p>Looks like we're close now to be in a good shape, let's see what we can do to better clean that up.</p><p>If we get a deeper look</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89fb80aeaee61427802c66_deeper-look.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dtravisphd?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">David Travis</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/glasses?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>We can see we're missing small letters and all caps letters. For example, for the 'You' word we're missing 'you' and we're also missing 'YOU'. Let's try to see if these words already exist:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep you
$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep YOU
</pre></div><p>So as we can see:</p><p>We're missing 2 words that each can contribute to our counts to the 'You' occurrence and 'Your' to make them 5540 and 2540 respectively.</p><p>What we need to do first is to convert each capital letter into small ones using <strong>tr </strong>which is a command-line utility that translates characters:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</pre></div><p><strong>tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' </strong>here translates the contents of <em>clickbait_data </em>into lower-case. <strong>['upper'] </strong>is a character class that represents all upper case characters and <strong>['lower'] </strong>is a character class that represents all lower case characters.</p><p>To prepend these values with the header, we can use <strong>sed </strong>to put two column names to represent each column:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | sed '1i count,word' | head 
</pre></div><p><strong>sed '1i count,word' </strong>so we’re having <em>count</em> representing the number of occurrences and <em>word</em> obviously representing the word</p><p><strong>1i </strong>is used here to write these two words at the first line and the change in the file will be in-place</p><p>outputting:</p><div><pre>count,word 
5540 you
4992 the
2540 your
1950 that
1944 are
1812 this
1653 and
1397 for
1326 what
</pre></div><p>In order to print that in a pretty shape we can use <strong>csvlook </strong>which will get us this:</p><div><pre>| count        | word |
| ------------ | ---- |
|    5540 you  |      |
|    4992 the  |      |

|    1950 that |      |
|    1944 are  |      |
|    1812 this |      |
|    1653 and  |      |
|    1397 for  |      |
|    1326 what |      |
</pre></div><p>which is not pretty at all. The reason this happened is that <strong>csvlook </strong>works as its name indicates to a better look for a CSV&nbsp;file so we should have a CSV (Comma Separated&nbsp;Value)&nbsp;file first. We should then find a way to separate each value at each line with a comma. At this point, we can use <strong>awk </strong>which is a pattern-directed scanning and processing language:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $1","$2}' | sed '1i count,word' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><p><strong>awk '{print $1","$2}' </strong></p><p><strong>'{</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print $1 </strong>here prints the first field (which is the count column) followed by...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>"," </strong>a comma followed by...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$2 </strong>the second field which is the word column</p><p><strong>}'</strong></p><p>It seems we're in much better shape now:</p><div><pre>| count | word |
| ----- | ---- |
| 5,540 | you  |
| 4,992 | the  |
| 2,540 | your |
| 1,950 | that |
| 1,944 | are  |
| 1,812 | this |
| 1,653 | and  |
| 1,397 | for  |
| 1,326 | what |
</pre></div><p>If we want to get the word column in the first field and the count column in the second field, we just need to reverse the order in the <strong>awk </strong>and <strong>sed </strong>command:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2","$1}' | sed '1i word,count' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><p>In order to get the same output for the non-clickbait data, we just need to change the filename:</p><div><pre>$ cat non_clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2","$1}' | sed '1i word,count' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><h2>Getting insight into the clickbait study</h2><p>In this study as reported by the <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~achakrab/papers/chakraborty_clickbait_asonam16.pdf">paper</a>, it addresses the clickbait and non-clickbait headlines to be able to detect both as</p><blockquote>Most of the online news media outlets rely heavily on the revenues generated from the clicks made by their readers, and due to the presence of numerous such outlets, they need to compete with each other for reader attention.</blockquote><p>So what's in this tutorial is a way to clean up data through the command-line so that we can get some insights about the result of this paper and see if we can get some points claimed by the paper through their research.</p><p>Again, let's see the final distribution of the most 20 common words for clickbait headlines for this data is:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89e590d4bb2d5e8b98f68d_clickbait_20_words.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>we can obviously see the excessive use of the possessive case <em>you </em>and not using the third person references like <em>he, she, </em>or a specific name</p><p>and …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">



<p>
<span>SnapRAID</span> is only one of the available <span>not standard RAID</span> solutions for disk arrays.
</p>

<p>
The best known others are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lime-technology.com/">unRAID</a>
- Commercial and OpenSource GPL2 solution. A modified version of the Linux Reiserfs filesystem with real-time redundancy.
No integrity checksum is supported.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flexraid.com/">FlexRAID</a>
- Commercial and proprietary C++/Java application for Windows, with some limited support for Linux.
It supports both snapshot redundancy and real-time redundancy, with integrity checksum.
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>
- OpenSource filesystem (but GPL incompatible) with real-time redundancy and integrity checksum.
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/btrfs">Btrfs</a>
- OpenSource filesystem GPL2 with real-time redundancy.
From Linux 3.9 it supports <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/536038/">RAID5/6 redundancy</a> and integrity checksums.
Recently various issues were found and the official <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID56">wiki</a> now states:
<i>The parity RAID code has multiple serious data-loss bugs in it. It should not be used for anything other than testing purposes.</i>
</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/05/virtualizing-storage-for-scale-resiliency-and-efficiency.aspx">Storage Spaces</a>
- The last contender from Microsoft, and integrated into Windows 8.
Proprietary with real-time redundancy. Checksumming is not supported.
It also has some other <a href="http://helgeklein.com/blog/2012/03/windows-8-storage-spaces-bugs-and-design-flaws/">limitations</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The main factor to categorize them is when the redundancy information is updated.
In <span>real-time</span> solutions the parity data is updated in real-time,
without an explicit action from the user. Like in standard RAID.
In <span>snapshot</span> solutions the parity data is updated only upon
an explicit request from the user. Like in backups.
</p>

<p>
Other important factors are the support of an <span>integrity</span> checksum
to identify <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/storage/data-corruption-is-worse-than-you-know/191">silent data corruption</a>
and the possibility to <span>fix it</span>,
if you can <span>use already filled disk</span>,
if you can <span>recover your data from not broken disks</span> when you get too many failures to have a full recover,
and if <span>all your disks are spinning when reading one file</span>.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
<a id="note1">[1]</a> - unRAID doesn't have any kind of checksum, and it just ignores silent errors.
Even worse, if a parity error is detected as result of a silent error in the data,
the parity is automatically recomputed, making impossible to recover the silent error, even manually.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note2">[2]</a> - Flexraid uses checksums to validate files, but such checksums
<a href="http://forum.flexraid.com/index.php/topic,3233.0.html">are not verified when data is read to update the parity</a>.
This means that any silent error present will propagate into the parity,
making impossible to fix it later, even if it can be still detected comparing the file checksum.
<br>
You can get in a state where the "Validate" operation
reports errors, but the "Verify" one reports no problem in the parity,
making impossible to fix the errors.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note3">[3]</a> - ZFS and Btrfs provide a bit-rot protection at the same level of SnapRAID,
always checking data before using it.
In this regards all the three solutions represent the state-of-the-art.
<br>
A cons of ZFS is that the default <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%27s_checksum">Fletcher</a>
checksum is a choice that favorites speed over quality.
The same for the default CRC32C used by Btrfs.
The 128 bits <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a>
used by SnapRAID is instead the state-of-the-art in checksumming quality,
without compromising in speed.
<br>
Another cons of ZFS is that it lacks a fast RAID implementation in assembler.
It only has a C implementation, that is from two to four times slower than SnapRAID/Btrfs.
<br>
ZFS also uses a sub-optimal RAID-Z3 algorithm, that requires double computations than the equivalent SnapRAID's z-parity.
<br>
Instead, both SnapRAID and Btrfs use top-notch assembler implementations to compute the RAID parity,
always using the best known RAID algorithm and implementation.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note4">[4]</a> - unRAID allows to use filled disks but only if they are already
formatted with the ReiserFS, XFS or Btrfs filesystems.
But not ext4 or NTFS, the two most common filesystems used in Linux and Windows.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note5">[5]</a> - ZFS allows to add a new vdev at the pool, but not a disk to a vdev.
See <a href="http://louwrentius.com/the-hidden-cost-of-using-zfs-for-your-home-nas.html">The 'Hidden' Cost of Using ZFS for Your Home NAS</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note6">[6]</a> - ZFS is also available in Linux at kernel level using <a href="http://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS on Linux</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note7">[7]</a> - ZFS has external GUIs, like <a href="http://www.napp-it.org/">Napp-it</a>
and plugins for <a href="http://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a> and <a href="http://www.nas4free.org/">NAS4Free</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note8">[8]</a> - unRAID can have integrity checksum using a plugin like
<a href="https://forums.lime-technology.com/topic/43290-dynamix-file-integrity-plugin/">Dynamix File Integrity</a>,
<a href="https://forums.lime-technology.com/topic/41708-checksum-suite/">Checksum Suite</a> or
<a href="https://forums.lime-technology.com/topic/35615-bunker-yet-another-utility-for-file-integrity-checks/">bunker</a>
but they are all independent at the parity processing and not used to help the recovering process.
For example, when recovering a single failed disk with double parity,
the checksum can be used to identify additional silent errors, and still be able to recover.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note9">[9]</a> - Storage Spaces can be used with ReFS that support integrity checksum, but not in the Parity mode:
<a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-resilient-file-system-refs-windows-10"><i>"Although, you may be able to select Simple (no resiliency) or Parity, both of these options will fail the process"</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note10">[10]</a> - Btrfs has external GUIs, like <a href="http://rockstor.com/">Rockstor</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note11">[11]</a> - Btrfs supports RAID5 from 2013, but recently some serious issues in the
RAID5/6 support were <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Btrfs-RAID-56-Is-Bad">found</a>.
At present they <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Btrfs-RAID56-Not-All-Clear">aren't fixed yet</a>.
The official wiki says:
<a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID56"><i>"The parity RAID code has multiple serious data-loss bugs in it. It should not be used for anything other than testing purposes"</i></a>.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In more recent machine learning benchmark tests, such as <a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks">Linguistic Acceptability</a>, I started to see Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), instead of more traditional accuracy or F1 score, being used as an evaluation metric. This Matthews Correlation Coefficient sounds familiar to me because previously I studied crystallography and there is a <a href="http://www.ruppweb.org/mattprob/default.html">“Matthews Coefficient (Probabilities)”</a> in crystallography which estimates probabilities for the occurrence of (protein) multimerization states in crystal. So I was very curious to see whether the two Matthews are the same person, what the correlations between Matthews Correlation Coefficient and Matthews Coefficient is, why a correlation coefficient would be used as a classification metric, and how Matthews Correlation Coefficient was derived. Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient">Wikipedia</a> hardly mentioned any of these.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to present my shallow archaeological investigation on Matthews Correlation Coefficient.</p>

<h3 id="confusion-matrix">Confusion Matrix</h3>

<p>Matthews Correlation Coefficient is computed entirely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion matrix</a>. It is necessary to understand the confusion matrix before we talk about Matthews Correlation Coefficient.</p>



<p>This is the confusion matrix for binary classifications. I will also restrict the discussion of the topic in this blog post to binary classifications.</p>

    <td>$TP$</td>
  </tr>

<p>Where $\boldsymbol{S}$ is the label of the data, and $\boldsymbol{P}$ is the prediction of the data. $TN$ is “True Positives”, $FN$ is “False Negatives”, $FP$ is “False Positives”, and $TP$ is “True Positives”.</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-matthews-correlation-coefficient">Definition of Matthews Correlation Coefficient</h3>

<p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient">Wikipedia</a>, it sounds like that this magic correlation coefficient was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Matthews_(biochemist)">Brian Matthews</a> in the paper <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1180967">“Comparison of the predicted and observed secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme”</a> published in 1975.</p>



<p>The original form of the expression revised from the paper, as described on Wikipedia, are</p><p>

\[n = TN + TP + FN + FP \\
\bar{S} = \frac{TP + FN}{n} \\
\bar{P} = \frac{TP + FP}{n} \\
\text{MCC} = \frac{TP/n - \bar{S}\bar{P}}{\sqrt{\bar{S}\bar{P}(1-\bar{S})(1-\bar{P})}}\]

</p><h3 id="derivation-of-matthews-correlation-coefficient">Derivation of Matthews Correlation Coefficient</h3>

<p>Wikipedia never mentioned anything about how this coefficient was derived and why this expression is called as a “correlation coefficient”. So I looked into the paper.</p>



<p>In the paper, the author said the (Matthews) correlation coefficient was a special case for this correlation coefficient given by a book “Statistical Methods for Research Workers” authored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>.</p><p>

\[C = \frac{\sum_\limits{n}(S_n - \bar{S})(P_n - \bar{P})}{\sqrt{\big[\sum_\limits{n}(S_n - \bar{S})^2\big] \big[\sum_\limits{n}(P_n - \bar{P})^2}\big]}\]

</p><p>Where $S_n$ is the observation value (label) for sample $n$, $P_n$ is the predicted value (prediction) for sample $n$, $\bar{S}$ and $\bar{P}$ are the mean values of $S_n$ and $P_n$, respectively.</p>



<p>Wait, does this correlation coefficient look familiar? I immediately realized that it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson Correlation Coefficient</a>, which is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables $X$ and $Y$! The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was developed in the 1800s which was way before Matthews Correlation Coefficient was born!</p>



<p>As a special case for Pearson Correlation Coefficient, in Matthews Correlation Coefficient, $S_n$ and $P_n$ could only be binary values $0$ and $1$, which is typical for classification problems. With this assumption, we could derive the original form of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient.</p>



<p>It might be a little bit brain-twisting, but we have the following facts from definition or slight math tricks.</p><p>

\[\sum_\limits{n}S_n = n\bar{S} = TP + FN\\
\sum_\limits{n}P_n = n\bar{P} = TP + FP\\
S^2_n = S_n \\
P^2_n = P_n \\
\sum_\limits{n} S_n P_n = TP \\\]

</p><p>We used the above facts to further derive the numerator and denominator.</p>



<p>For numerator,</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\sum_\limits{n}(S_n - \bar{S})(P_n - \bar{P}) &amp;= \sum_\limits{n}(S_n P_n - S_n\bar{P} - \bar{S}P_n + \bar{S}\bar{P}) \\
&amp;= \sum_\limits{n} S_n P_n - \sum_\limits{n} S_n\bar{P} - \sum_\limits{n} \bar{S}P_n + \sum_\limits{n} \bar{S}\bar{P} \\
&amp;= TP - \bar{P} \sum_\limits{n} S_n - \bar{S} \sum_\limits{n} P_n + n \bar{S}\bar{P} \\
&amp;= TP - n \bar{S}\bar{P} - n \bar{S}\bar{P} + n \bar{S}\bar{P} \\
&amp;= TP - n \bar{S}\bar{P} \\
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>For denominator,</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\sum_\limits{n}(S_n - \bar{S})^2 &amp;= \sum_\limits{n} (S^2_n - 2S_n \bar{S} + \bar{S}^2) \\
&amp;= \sum_\limits{n} S^2_n - \sum_\limits{n} 2S_n \bar{S} + \sum_\limits{n} \bar{S}^2\\
&amp;= \sum_\limits{n} S_n - 2 \bar{S} \sum_\limits{n} S_n + n\bar{S}^2 \\
&amp;= n\bar{S} - 2 n \bar{S}^2 + n\bar{S}^2 \\
&amp;= n\bar{S} - n \bar{S}^2 \\
&amp;= n\bar{S}(1 - \bar{S}) \\
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Similarly, we could derive</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\sum_\limits{n}(P_n - \bar{P})^2 &amp;= n\bar{P}(1 - \bar{P}) \\
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus, the whole denominator is</p><p>

\[\sqrt{\big[\sum_\limits{n}(S_n - \bar{S})^2\big] \big[\sum_\limits{n}(P_n - \bar{P})^2}\big] = n \sqrt{\bar{S}\bar{P}(1 - \bar{S})(1 - \bar{P})}\]

</p><p>Taken together, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\text{MCC} &amp;= \frac{TP - n \bar{S}\bar{P}}{n \sqrt{\bar{S}\bar{P}(1 - \bar{S})(1 - \bar{P})}} \\
&amp;= \frac{TP/n - \bar{S}\bar{P}}{\sqrt{\bar{S}\bar{P}(1-\bar{S})(1-\bar{P})}}
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="anecdote">Anecdote</h3>

<p>It turns out that Brian Matthews is the author for both “Matthews Correlation Coefficient” and “Matthews Coefficient (Probabilities)”. However, the physical meanings for these two are entirely different. People who do not study crystallography would probably never hear or use Matthews Coefficient (Probabilities).</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Matthews Correlation Coefficient is nothing special but applying Pearson Correlation Coefficient to binary classification problems where two random variables are prediction and label. That is to say, Matthews Correlation Coefficient is a discrete case for Pearson Correlation Coefficient.</p>



<p>When Pearson Correlation Coefficient or Matthews Correlation Coefficient is more close to 1.0, this means that more predictions match labels; When Pearson Correlation Coefficient is more close to -1.0, this means that more predictions disagree with labels; When Pearson Correlation Coefficient is more close to 0, this means that more predictions and labels do not have strong correlations, i.e., the predictions seem to be random.</p>



<p>I am very surprised that after so many years Pearson Correlation Coefficient was published, Pearson Correlation Coefficient was not used for binary classification problems until Brian Matthews’s work. If there are people who used Pearson Correlation Coefficient for binary classification problems, probably Matthews Correlation Coefficient has to change names.</p>

<p>Note that I am deliberately avoiding the <em>tech</em> side of this question. I’m not going to talk about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875">EEG</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078">PET</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768">MRI, and fMRI</a>. (Though they’re linked in case you want to learn more.) Modern brain-computer interface (or BCI) technologies are evolving too rapidly to bother with an overview of <em>them</em>. They’ll change in the real world by the time I press “publish,” much less by the time you read this. And sci-fi tech is most often a black box anyway. But the <em>human</em> part of the human-computer interaction model changes much more slowly. We can look to the brain as a relatively-unalterable component of the BCI question, leading us to two believability questions of sci-fi BCI.</p>



<ol><li>How can people express <em>intent</em> using their brains?</li><li>How do we prevent accidental activation using BCI?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s discuss each.</p>



<h3>1. How can people express intent using their brains? </h3>



<p>In the <em>see-think-do</em> loop of human-computer interaction…</p>



<ul><li><em>See</em> (perceive) has been a subject of visual, industrial, and auditory design.</li><li><em>Think</em> has been a matter of human cognition as informed by system interaction and content design.</li><li><em>Do</em> has long been a matter of some muscular movement that the system can detect, to start its matching <em>input-process-output</em> loop.

<p>But the first promise of BCI is to let that <em>doing</em> part happen with your brain. The brain isn’t a <em>muscle</em>, so what actions are BCI users able to take <em>in their heads</em> to signal to a BCI system what they want it to do? The answer to this question is partly physiological, about the way the brain changes as it goes about its thinking business.</p>

<p>Our brains are a dense network of bioelectric signals, chemicals, and blood flow. But it’s not chaos. It’s organized. It’s <em>locally functionalized</em>, meaning that certain parts of the brain are predictably activated when we think about certain things. But it’s not like the Christmas lights in Stranger Things, with one part lighting up discretely at a time. It’s more like an animated <a href="http://proportional symbol map">proportional symbol map</a>, with lots of places lighting up at the same time to different degrees.</p>

<p>The sizes and shapes of what’s lighting up may change slightly between people, but a basic map of healthy, undamaged brains will be similar to each other. Lots of work has gone on to map these functional areas, with researchers showing subjects lots of stimuli and noting what areas of the brain light up. Test enough of these subjects and you can build a pretty good functional map of concepts. Thereafter, you can take a “picture” of the brain, and you can cross-reference your maps to reverse-engineer what is being thought.</p>

<p>Similarly the brain maps we have are only for a small percentage of an average adult vocabulary. Jack Gallant’s semantic map viewer (pictured and linked above) shows the maps for about 140 concepts, and estimates of average active vocabulary is <a href="https://wordcounter.io/blog/how-many-words-does-the-average-person-know/#:~:text=According%20to%20lexicographer%20and%20dictionary,vocabulary%20is%20around%2040%2C000%20words.%E2%80%9D">around 20,000 words</a>, so we’re looking at a tenth of a tenth of what we can imagine (not even counting the infinite composability of language). But in the future we will not only have more concepts mapped, more confidently, but we will also have idiographs for each individual, like the personal dictionary in your smart phone.</p>



<p>All this is to say that our extant real world technology confirms that <em>thoughts</em> are a believable input for a system. This includes linguistic inputs like “Turn on the light” and “activate the vibranium sand table” and “Sincerely, Chris” and even <em>imagining</em> the desired change, like a light changing from dark to light. It might even include subconscious thoughts that yet to be formed into words.</p>



<h3>2. How do we prevent accidental activation?</h3>



<p>But we know from personal experience, we don’t want <em>all</em> our thoughts to be acted on. Take, for example, those thoughts you’re feeling <a href="https://bradfordhealth.com/halt-hunger-anger-loneliness-tiredness/">hangry</a>, or snarky, or dealing with a jerk-in-authority. Or those texts and emails that you’ve composed in the heat of the moment but wisely deleted before they get you in trouble.</p>

<p>If a speculative BCI is being read by a general artificial intelligence, it can manage that just like a smart human partner would.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>He is composing a blog post</em>, reasons the AGI, <em>so I will just disregard his thought that he needs to pee</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>And if there’s any doubt, an AGI can ask. <strong>“Did you intend me to include the bit about pee in the post?”</strong> Me: <strong>“Certainly not. Also BRB.”</strong> (Readers following the <em><a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/category/black-panther-2018/?order=asc">Black Panther</a></em> reviews will note that AGI is available to Wakandans in the form of Griot.)</p>



<p>If AGI is <em>unavailable</em> to the diegesis (and it would significantly change any diegesis of which it is a part) then we need some way to indicate when a thought is intended as input and when it isn’t. Having that be some <em>mode</em> of thought feels complicated and error-prone, like when programmers have to write regex expressions that escape escape characters. Better I think is to use some secondary channel, like a bodily interaction. Touch forefinger and pinky together, for instance, and the computer understands you intend your thoughts as input.</p>



<p><strong>So, for any BCI that appears in sci-fi, we would want to look for the presence or absence of AGI as a <em>reasonableness</em> interpreter, and, barring that, for some alternate-channel mechanism for indicating deliberateness. We would also hope to see some feedback and correction loops to understand the nuances of the edge-case interactions, but these are rare in sci-fi.</strong></p>

<h2>Even more future-full</h2>



<p>This all points to the question of what <em>seeing/perceiving</em> via a BCI might be. A simple example might be a disembodied voice that only the user can hear.</p>



<blockquote><p>A woman walks alone at night. Lost in thoughts, she hears her AI whisper to her thoughts, “Ada, be aware that a man has just left a shadowy doorstep and is following, half a block behind you. Shall I initialize your <a href="https://www.gattamatta.com/electric_scenario.html">shock shoes</a>?”</p></blockquote>



<p>What other than language can be written to the brain in the far future? Images? Movies? Ideas? A suspicion? A compulsion? A hunch? How will people know what are their own thoughts and what has been placed there from the outside? I look forward to the stories and shows that illustrate new ideas, and warn us of the dark pitfalls.</p>

    <p>My toy stock toolkit application is “feature complete” for now. I’m very happy with both the quality of the tooling and the ease of using it. Svelte combines well with Tailwind and lets me get things done on the front end more easily than I imagined. This post summarizes what I made along with what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>My code is available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~tuxpup/stock-toolkit">in this repository</a>. Bear in mind it is the very opposite of “battle-tested” in the unlikely event you do anything other than just look at it.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>My web development skills have tilted toward heavy, server-side things over the years. I wanted to update my tools and my skills over the full stack, but especially on the front end, where I was feeling closer to 1997 than 2020. So I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvzuUVysUFOvgy_72v-Poz_UPF1Rjp42Y">this tutorial</a> and did the backend in FastAPI with a different database layer and did the front end in Svelte with Tailwind CSS.</p>
<p>For more details, look at the previous posts:</p>

<li><a href="https://geoff.tuxpup.com/posts/tailwind_svelte">Getting vanilla Tailwind integrated with svelte build</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve attempted to update them with new things I’ve learned, as applicable.</p>
<h2 id="the-product">The Product</h2>
<p>This application lets the user make a list of stocks, by ticker symbol. It fetches details about these stocks from Yahoo finance. It lets the user filter based on these details, add new symbols, and delete symbols. It isn’t a particularly exciting set of functionality, but it covers a surface area that lines up fairly neatly with the things I usually want to build. This screenshot should give the general idea:</p>
<p><img src="https://geoff.tuxpup.com/posts/stock_toolkit_4/filtered_screen.png" alt="filtered screen"></p>
<p>I used svelte without leaning heavily on any UI component library. While I spent quite a bit of time exploring <a href="https://sveltematerialui.com/">Svelte Material UI</a> and <a href="https://smeltejs.com/">smelte</a> and liked both a great deal, I ultimately felt like I needed to avoid both for now. A big part of that is needing to understand svelte more deeply. For now, those both hide too much magic. smui uses sass, which I don’t understand very well. smelte uses typescript, which I also don’t understand very well. I’m interested in both (especially typescript) but felt like I was collapsing under an attempt to learn too many new things at once while hiding parts of svelte I want to understand before I use other people’s components under a bit too much magic. I was also having a hard time making smelte play well with my own usage of Tailwind. I do want to go back and look at both again once I’ve got some of my own components under my belt.</p>

<h3 id="application-shell">Application Shell</h3>
<p>The scripts in <code>App.svelte</code> are high on my list of things to golf down if I continue to do anything else with this. All of the API interaction is there and is a strong candidate for moving out to its own module. And there’s some event handling there that could probably be done just by reacting to changes to a data store. Leaving those aside, though, the app component is very simple:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;
    :<span>global</span><span>(</span>.<span>max-w-app</span><span>)</span> {

    &lt;/<span>Modal</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>By bulk, the largest part of it is some UI niceness for when no stocks are returned by the API. It also shows the two library components I did wind up using: svelte-spinner and svelte-simple-modal. I used the spinner because making one wasn’t interesting to me and I like it better than just showing the word “Loading…”. I used svelte-simple-modal because I realized I was recreating it less robustly as I was about a third of the way through making my own modal dialog class. The interesting thing about it here is that the component which shows the dialog needs to be a child of a <code>Modal</code> to get at its context.</p>
<p>The header and the stock toolbar communicate with the app shell using both events and stores.</p>
<h3 id="using-stores">Using Stores</h3>
<p>I used stores for two purposes. The first, to set a “loading” flag so that various components can decline to trigger API requests while the stock table is changing probably would’ve worked with simpler bindings. I mainly did it to learn how to use the writable store. The filter is shared between the app and the toolbar this way, too. I originally passed that as part of an event, but I tried it this way so that I could learn how to use something a little more complicated than a bool or an int in a store. I’m glad I did that, because there was an interesting and non-obvious (to me) wrinkle.</p>
<p>My filter store:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>filter</span> <span>=</span> <span>writable</span>(
    {
        <span>forward_pe</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span>,
        <span>dividend_yield</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span>,
        <span>ma50</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span>,
        <span>ma200</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span>,
        <span>is_empty</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span>() {
            <span>return</span> (<span>this</span>.<span>forward_pe</span>.<span>length</span> <span>===</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
                <span>this</span>.<span>dividend_yield</span>.<span>length</span> <span>===</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
                <span>!</span><span>this</span>.<span>ma50</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span><span>this</span>.<span>ma200</span>
            );
        }
    }
)
</code></pre></div><p>has a function to query for whether a filter is empty. I first learned that, a little contrary to my intuition, something like <code>$filter.forward_pe = "42"</code> does not update the store. And using a setter with a dictionary like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>filter</span>.<span>set</span>({<span>"forward_pe"</span><span>:</span> <span>"42"</span>, <span>"dividend_yield"</span><span>:</span> <span>"0"</span>, <span>"ma50"</span><span>:</span><span>true</span>, <span>"ma200"</span><span>:</span><span>false</span>})
</code></pre></div><p>gets rid of the is_empty() function. So this was the simplest way I could find to update the filter:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">    <span>function</span> <span>save_filter</span>() {
        <span>filter</span>.<span>set</span>({...<span>$filter</span>,
            <span>forward_pe</span><span>:</span> <span>pe_filter</span>, <span>dividend_yield</span><span>:</span> <span>dividend_filter</span>, <span>ma50</span><span>:</span> <span>ma50</span>, <span>ma200</span><span>:</span> <span>ma200</span>
        });
    }
</code></pre></div><h3 id="message-dispatching">Message Dispatching</h3>
<p>I really like the way svelte’s message dispatching works, but one thing that bit me a little was the inability to bubble up custom messages whose names may be calculated at runtime. The usual way of adding <code>on:event</code> without assignment to a component doesn’t work because there seems to be no way to have <code>event</code> be the result of evaluating a variable.</p>
<p>I wanted to use custom events to make buttons pass messages to a controller. e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">{#each toolbarItems as tbItem}
&lt;<span>Button</span> <span>action</span><span>=</span><span>{tbItem.action}</span> <span>icon</span><span>=</span><span>{tbItem.icon}</span> <span>on:</span><span>{</span><span>tbItem</span><span>.</span><span>action</span><span>}</span>&gt;
{/each}
</code></pre></div><p>That would seem to be a broadly useful pattern, but I couldn’t see a way to do that directly. It feels like it might be worth asking around about.</p>
<h3 id="stock-table">Stock Table</h3>
<p>I really like my stock table component with selectable rows. I think it turned out well, and I spent less time writing it than I did trying to figure out how to alter the one from smelte to have selectable rows. I still want to go back and look at that again, though, because smelte’s is overall a nicer table. I am especially happy with the behavior of clicking a row to select it. While I like how it turned out, it smells like I might’ve missed an opportunity to use some of the built in reactivity offered by the framework. I had a click on a row trigger a javascript function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>tr</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"bg-white lg:hover:bg-gray-100 flex lg:table-row flex-row border-b border-l border-r lg:flex-row flex-wrap lg:flex-no-wrap mb-10 lg:mb-0"</span>

</span><span></span>    <span>// by merely toggling its checked state. there may be a better way to do it; this way requires a click handler
</span><span></span>    <span>// on the checkbox to stop propagation in order to allow both direct clicks and clicks on the row.
</span><span></span>    <span>function</span> <span>clickSelected</span>(<span>record</span>) {

        <span>checkbox</span>.<span>click</span>();
    }

<div><pre><code data-lang="html">    &lt;<span>input</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"form-checkbox text-green-600"</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"{'select-' + record.id}"</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I can hardly claim to have worked professionally with 10BASE5 as when I first started building my own 10BASE2 networks in 1997, 10BASE5 was long obsolete. Back then, I knew about 10BASE5, but it wasn’t practical, affordable or interesting enough for me to attempt building one.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012, and 10BASE5 is now truly a vintage technology. Anyone studying something&nbsp;I.T. related likely will at some point have been told about this stuff, because it’s very important in the history of computing. This was the first standardised, commercially used form of Ethernet, and today, almost the entire Internet is Ethernet, but heck, who’s ever actually seen a working 10BASE5 setup? Not me, that’s for sure, nor or anyone I’ve ever met.</p>
<p>So… can I build a working setup in 2012? Read on…</p>

<p>I’ve written this page primarily for people like myself, who came into the computing scene just a bit too late to have ever seen this technology in use. A 1980s network engineer can safely skip this page.</p>

<p>In order to connect to a true 10BASE5 network, network adapters with AUI are required. AUI stands for Attachment Unit Interface. It is in effect, a media independent form of all of the physical 10Mbit ethernet variants, which I shall call 10BASE-X. AUI was to 10BASE-X what MII is to 100BASE-X, with the exception that MII is rarely found as an external connector.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for this project, networking equipment with external AUI connectors is becoming rather difficult to find.</p>
<p>As I see it, there’s 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build true 10BASE5 nodes using equipment natively supporting AUI</li>
<li>Bridge to something else i.e. 10BASE-T</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building true 10BASE5 nodes</h2>
<p>Not many options remain for connecting to modern PCs. Here’s a few:</p>
<h3>ISA Cards</h3>
<p>While this can be done, modern mainboards with ISA slots are niche and very expensive. I ruled out this option.</p>
<p><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509.jpg" alt="3c509" width="717" height="453" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509.jpg 717w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509-150x95.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></a></p>

<h3>PCI Cards</h3>
<p>Fortunately, some modern PCs still have 32-Bit/5 volt parallel PCI slots, also, PCI and 10BASE5 had enough overlap that a small number of products were manufactured. A couple of examples are the 3Com 3C900B-COMBO, and 3C905B-COMBO. At the time of writing there were a fair few of these on eBay, but often for outrageous sums of money. Fortunately I managed to pick up a couple for a few quid. 64-Bit Windows drivers do not exist, making Windows 7 32-bit likely the last version of Windows able to make use of them, short of writing some new drivers. All versions of Linux will work OK with these.</p>

Using a 3Com 3c905B-COMBO NIC with AUI</figcaption></figure>
<h3>USB or other solutions</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell no USB product was ever made. With 10BASE5 MAU’s requiring 12 volts and some 5 or more watts of power, over and above what USB can provide, this would be a problematic proposition. Also, no single chip “USB with AUI” solutions exist. From my research, it seems theoretically possible to create a 2-chip adapter, with external power supply, but apparently there is no market for such as a thing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_71" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71"><a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/usbaui/"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-800x534.jpg" alt="USB AUI Ethernet adapter proof of concept, based on a D-Link DUB-E100, NQ8502 connected to MII" width="474" height="316" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-800x534.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-150x100.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-300x200.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn.jpg 880w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71">A D-Link DUB-E100 with its 100BASE-TX PHY removed, and an NQ8502 frankensteined in its place.<br> This image illustrates my key design objective: To give an AUI interface to a USB Ethernet MAC, instead of converting from 10BASE-T.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But that didn’t stop me from building one. Above is what is quite possibly one of the worlds only USB Ethernet Adapters with AUI interface. I have a seperate project page for this&nbsp;<a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/usbaui/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Routers</h3>
<p>A Cisco NM-1E2W module could be used if one has a large ISR kicking around.</p>
<h2>Bridging 10BASE5 to modern twisted pair networks</h2>
<h3>10BASE-T Hubs equipped with AUI</h3>
<p>Using a 10BASE-T hub with AUI to bridge to a twisted pair network is probably the easiest approach. There’s thousands of these for sale on eBay for peanuts, but in my case, having one of these on each node would make the setup rather clunky.</p>
<h3>10BASE-T to AUI Media converters</h3>
<p>What I was really looking for was a few of these little boxes. Easily mistaken for a 10BASE-T MAU, these (unlike the former which tend to be spilling out of every I.T. junk box in the land) are fairly uncommon.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17"><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-800x475.jpg" alt="Allied Telesis MC12T" width="474" height="281" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-800x475.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-150x89.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-300x178.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T.jpg 872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17">An Allied Telesis MC12T next to an ordinary 10BASE-T MAU. Spot the difference?</figcaption></figure>

<p>To keep the cost of this project to a minimum, I decided my network would only have 3-4 nodes as this was sufficient to demonstrate a proper shared media network as opposed to a 2 node effective “point to point” link. For this I sourced the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x 3Com 3C900B-COMBO PCI NICs with AUI</li>
<li>3x MiLAN MIL-130A AUI-to-10BASE-T bridges</li>
<li>1x MiLAN MIL-10P 10BASE-T Transceiver (for testing AUI nodes)</li>
<li>1x Allied Telesis MC12T</li>
<li>6x Cabletron ST-500 MAU’s</li>
<li>3x AMP 228752-1 Vampire taps</li>
<li>2x AMP 221914-1 Intrusive N connector taps</li>
<li>5x AUI Drop cables</li>
<li>15M of Belden #9880 cable</li>
<li>2x 50ohm N terminators</li>
<li>2x N female to female couplers</li>
<li>10x UNC 4-40 x 1.1/2″ countersunk screws (to replace missing ones on my MAUs)</li>
</ul>

<p>A common belief persists that 10BASE5 used RG-8/U cable. This, for the most part, appears to be untrue. The cable used was purpose designed for 10BASE5 and manufactured by Belden under the part number 9880 (A few other compatible cables may exist). The reason #9880 cable was specified is that several variants of RG-8 exist with varying dimensions and manufacturing standards. Given that the main form of connection of MAU’s to 10BASE5 networks was by the precisely designed prongs in “Vampire taps”, cable dimensions and dielectric consistency had to be spot on.</p>
<p>A network designed using only intrusive N connector taps such as AMP 221914-1 could get away with using pretty much any 50 ohm coax, but then the sum total of insertion losses created by each node may prevent the full 500M segment length from being achieved. Also, this approach wouldn’t permit addition of new nodes without bringing down the network. After an evening of wrestling with RG-8/U cable (why oh why didn’t I just buy RG-58) while attempting to make a short test lead, I think I’ll stick with the Vampire Taps.</p>
<p>For someone like me who hadn’t encountered it before, no amount of looking at pictures could prepare for how big this stuff is. Short of high power transmission cables, it’s the largest coaxial cable I’ve ever seen. It is also very heavy, rigid and the bend radius is absurdly large.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of this cable is the black bands which appear every 2.5M. In 10BASE5 networks, MAUs can only be attached at 2.5M intervals, this is to ensure that signal reflections generated by taps stay out of phase, which stops them compounding across the whole segment. In a small network such as mine, it’s probably not so important to respect this tap placement rule, but I’ll respect it anyway.</p>

Either side of this frame is 10 kilos of steel, about the minimum required to hold this stuff down for the photo</figcaption></figure>

<p>Unlike the BNC connectors found on 10BASE2, the official connector used by 10BASE5 (where connectors are required) is the N connector. While still used extensively in lab/specialist environments, this large coaxial connector isn’t something the average ‘tech dude’ is likely to encounter these days. They perform exceptionally, have an intrinsic impedance of 50 ohms, are fairly common/inexpensive and easily handle the large sized #9880 cable.</p>

<p>These cables sporting male and female 15-pin D-sub connectors, connect a node to the MAU. Since the MAU is bolted to a rigid behemoth piece of coax, it wasn’t exactly convenient to try and drag that lot down to the back of a PC, so these cables bridged that gap. With a maximum length of 50 metres, that gap can be very large indeed. Also, given that taps could only be placed at 2.5M intervals, a world without drop cables would lend its self to much humour around the office, at the expense of well-intended PC and desk placement considerations.</p>
<p>One notable feature is the slide locking mechanism used in place of the usual UNC 4-40 screws. It is my personal opinion that the design of this mechanism is a bit daft. In theory it’s a good idea but in practice I think it was implemented too flimsily. AUI drop cables are often very large and rigid (likely thanks to a half a dozen layers of shielding), so much so that a mild sideways nudge on a cable can easily rip a latched connector straight out of the socket, bending/breaking the mechanism. They also have a feature that the screws in the female end often work their way out over time, inevitably to be lost forever. Even during this small scale project, I have suffered some grief over these locking mechanisms. I can imagine they were a source of many support calls in the 80s and early 90s.</p>

<p>These metal boxes are one of the key defining pieces of kit in a 10BASE5 network. They function as the transceiver, converting the primitive signals from the AUI interface to what’s required on the physical media, as well as performing collision detection. They came in 4 flavours:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE5 networks, using a Vampire Tap</li>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE5 networks, using N connectors (Rare)</li>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE2 networks, using BNC connectors</li>
<li>Without a tap (Buy your own)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose Cabletron ST-500’s, because they have blinky lights. The ST-500 (90 Series) would have been one of the last and most modern 10BASE5 MAUs manufactured. The internal component count (when compared with, say, a DEC h4000) is low.</p>

<p>By far the most common means of connection to the coax segment. The bottom half is plastic, I assume to eliminate ground loops by ensuring the braid remains electrically isolated from the metal case of the MAU. The top half is extruded aluminium. Each contains three prongs (two to connect to the braid, and one to the centre conductor). To me, the idea of using this style of connection to coaxial cable is ambitious, but it has to be said that a few spikes in a coaxial cable will equate to significantly less reflection and insertion loss …</p></div></div>

<p><em>(This is an edited and expanded version of a talk I gave in Trento, Italy in June 2018, on a panel <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/why-digital-currency-wont-save-us">with Sheila Dow</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The topic today is “Digital currencies: threat or opportunity?”</p>
<p>I’d like to offer a third alternative: New digital currencies like bitcoin are neither a threat or an opportunity. They do not raise any interesting economic questions and do not pose any significant policy problems. They do not represent any kind of technological advance on existing payment systems, which are of course already digital. They are just another asset bubble, based on the usual mix of fraud and fantasy. By historical standards, they are not a very large or threatening bubble. There is nothing important about them at all.</p>
<p>Why might you conclude that the new digital currencies don’t matter?</p>
<p>– Aggregate size – the total value of all bitcoin is on the order of $200 billion, other digital currencies are much smaller. On the scale of modern financial markets that’s not much more than a rounding error.</p>
<p>– No articulation with the rest of the financial system. No banks or other important institutions rely on cryptocurrencies to settle transactions, or have substantial holdings on their balance sheets. They’re not used as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>– Not used to structure real activity. No significant part of collective productive or reproductive activity is organized by making payments or taking positions in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Besides that, these currencies don’t even do what they claim to do. In practice, digital currencies do depend on intermediaries. Payment is inconvenient and expensive — as much as $14 per transaction, and accepted by only 3 of top 500 online retailers. And markets in these currencies are not decentralized, but dominated by a few big players. All this is documented in Mike Beggs’ wonderful <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/04/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-monetary-system">Jacobin article on cryptocurrencies</a>, which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>Compare this to the mortgage market. Total residential mortgages in the US are over $13 trillion, not far short of GDP. The scale is similar in many other countries. Mortgages are a key asset for the financial system, even when not securitized. And of course they play a central role in organizing the provision of housing (and commercial space), an absolutely essential function to social reproduction.</p>
<p>And yet here we are talking about cryptocurrencies. Why?</p>
<p>Partly it’s just hard money crankery and libertarianism, which have a outsized voice in economics discussions. And partly it’s testimony to the success of their marketing machine. One might say that the only thing that stands behind that $200 billion value, is the existence of conversations like this one.</p>
<p>But it’s not just cranks and libertarians who care about cryptocurrencies. Central bank research departments are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-cenbank-idUSKBN26Z2R0">earnestly exploring</a> the development of digital currencies. This disproportionate attention reflects, I think, some deeper problems with how we think of money and central banking. The divide over whether crypto-currencies represent anything new or important reflects a larger divide over how we conceive of the monetary system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://jwmason.org/slackwire/dont-start-from-coin/">language of Schumpeter</a> — whose discussion in his <em>History of Economic Thought</em> remains perhaps the best starting point for thinking about these things — it comes down to whether we “start from the coin.” If we start from the coin, if we think of money as a distinct tangible thing, a special kind of asset, then bitcoin may look important. We could call this the quantity view of money. But if we follow Schumpeter — and in different ways Hyman Minsky, Perry Mehrling and David Graeber — and start from balance sheets, then it won’t. Call this the ledger view of money.</p>
<p>In the quantity view, “money” is something special. The legal monopoly of governments on printing currency is very important, because that is money in a way that other assets aren’t. Credit created by banks is something different. Digital currencies are a threat or opportunity, as the case may be, because they seem to also go in this exclusive “outside money” box.</p>
<p>But from the Minsky-Mehrling-Graeber point of view, there’s nothing special about outside money. It’s just another set of tokens for recording changes in the social ledger. What matters isn’t the way that changes are recorded, but the accounts themselves. From this perspective, “money” isn’t an asset, a thing, it is simply the arbitrary units in which ledgers are kept and contracts denominated.</p>
<p>The starting point, from this point of view, is a network of money payments and commitments. Some of these commitments structure real activity (I show up for work because I expect to receive a wage). Others are free-standing. (I pay you interest because I owe you a debt.) In either case money is simply a unit of account. I have made a promise to you, you have a made a promise to someone else; these promises are in some cases commitments to specific concrete activities (to show up for work and do what you’re told), but in other cases they are quantitative, measured as a certain quantity of “money.”</p>
<p>What does money mean here? Simply whatever will be accepted as fulfilment of the promise, as specified in whatever legal or quasi-legal provisions govern it. It is entirely possible for the unit of account to have no concrete existence at all. And in any case the concrete assets that will be accepted are never identical; their equivalence is to some extent a fiction enshrined in the terms of the contract, and to some extent the result of active interventions by whatever authorities are responsible for the payments system.</p>
<p>In short, the fact that some particular asset that serves as money in this or that case is not very interesting. What matters is the balance sheets. Money is just a means of recording changes on balance sheets, of making transfers between ledgers. If we take the ledger view, then there’s no difference between physical currency and an instrument like a check. In either case the social ledger maintained by the banking system has a certain credit to you. You want to transfer a part of that to someone else, for whatever reason. So you give that person a piece of paper with the amount written on it, and they take it to their bank, which adjusts the social ledger accordingly. It makes no difference whether the piece of paper is a dollar or euro bill or a check or a money order, any more than it matters what its physical dimensions are or whether it is one sheet of paper or two.</p>
<p>And of course the majority of transactions are made, the majority of obligations, are settled without using pieces of paper at all. In fact the range of transactions you can carry out using the pieces of paper we call “money” is rather limited.</p>
<p>To put it another way: At the train station there are various machines, which will give you a piece of paper while debiting your bank account. Some of those pieces of paper can be used in exchange for a train ride, others for various other purposes. We call one a ticket machine and one an ATM. But conceptually we should think of them as the same kind of machine. Both debit your social ledger and then give you a claim on something concrete — a paper from the newsstand, say, or a train ride, as the case may be.</p>
<p>In the quantity view of money, there is some special asset called money which the rest of the payments system builds off. So the fact that something else could “be” money seems important. It matters that the government has a legal monopoly on printing currency, so it also matters that something like cryptocurrency seems to evade that monopoly. In the ledger view, on the other hand, that legal monopoly doesn’t matter at all. There are lots of systems for making transfers between bank accounts, including many purely electronic ones. And there are social ledgers maintained by institutions that we don’t officially recognize as banks. New digital currencies introduce a few more of each. So what?</p>
<p>In the quantity view, money and credit are two distinct things. We start with money, which might then be lent. This is how we learn it as children. In the ledger view, money is just anything that settles an obligation. And that is constantly done by promises or IOUs. The fact that “banks create money” in our modern economy isn’t some kind of innovation out of an original situation of cash-on-the-barrelhead exchange. Rather, it is a restriction of money-creation from the historical situation where third-party IOUs of all kinds circulated as payment.</p>
<p>Related to this are two different views of central banks. In the quantity view, the fundamental role of the central bank is in some sense setting or managing the money supply. In the ledger view, where money is just an arbitrary subset of payments media, which is constantly being created and destroyed in the course of making payments, “the money supply” is a nonsense term. What central banks are doing in this view is controlling the elasticity of the credit system. In other words, they are managing the willingness and ability of economic units to make promises to each other.</p>
<p>There are a variety of objectives in this; two important ones today are to control the pace of real activity via the elasticity of money commitments (e.g. to <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/01/federal-reserve-interest-rate-increase-janet-yellen-inflation-unemployment/">keep the wage share within certain bounds</a> by controlling the level of aggregate employment) and to maintain the integrity of the payments system in a crisis where a wave of self-perpetuating defaults is possible.</p>
<p>In either case the thing which the central bank seeks to make more scarce or abundant is not the quantity of some asset labeled as “money”, but the capacity to make promises. To reduce the level of real activity, for example, the central bank needs to make it more difficult for economic units to make claims on real resources on the basis of promises of future payments. To avoid or resolve a crisis the central bank needs to increase the trustworthiness of units so they can settle outstanding obligations by making new promises; alternatively it can substitute its …</p></div></article></div>

<h5>2,079,471 stars</h5>
<p>
To strike fear in the computing world, just whisper "traveling salesman problem."
The echo will be <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-quantum-computing-is-changing-the-world-three-israelis-are-leading-the-revolution-1.8530603">"if we want to figure out the route for 28 cities, the universe will die before we get the result."</a>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the reputation of the problem is such that advances on small instances (using admittedly cool technology) are newsworthy, such as recent reports on a new AI <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a30655520/scientists-solve-traveling-salesman-problem/">"processor to solve 22 cities"</a> or an 8-stop tour found by an ameoba <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a25686417/amoeba-math/">"that might just change the face of computing forever"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Our work is decidedly less exotic, but at a much, much larger scale.
With <a href="http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/">Keld Helsgaun</a>, from Roskilde University in Denmark, we aim to compute the shortest-possible tour through the <a href="http://www.mpia.de/~calj/tgas_distances/main.html">3D positions of over two million individual stars</a>, a point set based on the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-release-1">ESA Gaia Data Release 1</a>.
</p>


<h5>28,884,352 parsecs</h5>
<p>
From October 2017 through October 2019, week by week, we produced shorter and shorter 3D star tours, employing an array of heuristic-search techniques and ever-increasing amounts of computing power.
The foundation for this effort was Keld's <a href="http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/">LKH</a> software package, a powerhouse code for obtaining near-optimal solutions to the TSP and related routing problems. 
On top of LKH, we added methods specialized for such a large data set, combining local search and genetic algorithms, together with decomposition strategies to allow for parallel computation.
</p>

<p>
The search continued through the end of last year, but we found no further improvements on a solution from October 6, 2019.
That's the tour displayed in the moving image.
Its total length is 28,884,352.4 parsecs, or, if you prefer, 94,208,157.5 light years.
</p>


<h5>0.0000074 guarantee</h5>
<p>
A crucial point is this is not just any route through the stars.
Ours comes together with a proof that its length, if not the absolute shortest possible, is off by at most a factor of 0.0000074.
To put this in perspective, it's like a New York to Los Angles road trip guaranteed to be within half a city block of the optimal cross-country drive.
</p>

<p>
Our quality guarantee is provided by another difficult computation.
Over the past two-and-a-half years we have been running a linear programming, cutting-plane method to slowly close the gap between our solution and a lower bound on the length of each of the unimaginably many possible tours through the point set.
Our work here builds on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver">Concorde TSP Solver</a>, again making numerous adjustments to handle the expectionally large number of points and to permit extensive parallel computation.
</p>

<h5>Parsecs to dollars</h5>
<p>
We know there is no tour more than 213.4 parsecs shorter than our route.
Close enough for Jean-Luc Picard, perhaps, but attacks on closing the remaining gap may lead to mathematical techniques having wide application beyond the world of Star Trek. 
If you think you can help, I'm offering a bounty of $50 for each parsec you can save by rearranging the flight through the stars.
It would aid our work to have an improved target tour if one exists, so I'm happy to offer a reward to encourage more eyes on the data set.
</p>

<p>
And don't worry about the budget.
Keld and I won $17,000 in a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/overview">Kaggle competition</a> last year; I put some of my share aside to payoff any shortcut finders.

<p>Hello! 👋  My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>It was never part of my life goals to start my own company, let alone a company of one. In fact, if you had asked me before I actually took the leap if this was within the realm of possibility, I would have said <em>hell freakin’ no.</em></p>

<p>To be honest, I hadn’t thought about it even after I started working on Lunch Money. It was only after I saw success during launch that I decided to quit my freelancing jobs to pursue this endeavour full-time.</p>

<p>So why the 180-degree change? Upon reflection, I realized that the aggregate of my life and work experience made this a sensible decision and allowed me to transition easily into the role. I feel that I was ready for something like this for some time, but I had learned to be picky with what I spend my effort on and the right project never came up until Lunch Money. <strong>In this article, I will go into 4 specific life and career decisions that I consider foundational to my solopreneurship journey.</strong></p>



<p>I had never given much thought to how important transferrable skills were until I realized that simply being a software engineer at any tech company in the Bay Area did not result in more-or-less the same set of experiences and skills.</p>

<p>A friend told me a story of how working at [unnamed large software company] simplified a lot of processes for the sake of moving quickly. For instance, databases could be spun up via one-click deploy coupled with homegrown configuration files for adjustments. They’d later on realize as they were job hunting that setting up a data store was not so straight forward, but all the difficult parts had been abstracted out and they never got the chance to peek under the hood.</p>

<p>Consider two internships I had during my college years. The first was at Qualcomm– a large well-known international company with decades of proven engineering expertise. The second was a small seed-funded start-up of 3 founders, another intern and myself that had recently pivoted and hadn’t found their product market fit yet.</p>

<p>Granted that Qualcomm is in a totally different field of embedded software and hardware engineering, a lot of the tech I worked with was proprietary. I learned virtually no transferrable hard skills during my double-term internship at Qualcomm.</p>

<p>At the smaller (now defunct) start-up, I learned how to use Github. I worked with open source projects for the first time. I learned how to communicate with clients as I was building apps for them. I learned how to think about web versus mobile design. I learned a ton of Javascript. These are all skillsets I am still tapping into today.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you need to be strategic with the company you choose to join. Your time is valuable!</p>



<p>I feel strongly that working on three different teams at Twitter helped me gain experience critical to running Lunch Money on my own today. I stayed on each team for roughly 1 year, having made significant impact before moving onto the next.</p>

<p>I started on Observability which was responsible for building a monitoring tool for internal use. I was specifically hired to work on the front-end side of things so I had full autonomy over the UI and UX of these dashboards.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/observability.png" alt=""> <span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2013/observability-at-twitter.html" target="_blank">source</a></span><span>I designed and implemented data visualization and monitoring systems using Ruby on Rails and backbone.js at Twitter</span></p>

<p>I would have probably stayed on longer if it weren’t for my manager and another team that was looking to “borrow” an engineer for some high priority growth initiatives. My manager volunteered me and I was excited to work on a public-facing project for once. Little did I know there was a breakdown in communication and the receiving team, hearing that I was coming from “Platform Engineering”, assumed that I was a backend and Scala wiz.</p>

<p>Despite my initial uneasiness, I tapped into my “fake it til you make it” mentality and I learned Scala on the job. It wasn’t easy going from Javascript to a strongly-typed language but with a few late nights and the help of some very patient engineers, I was able to ship a couple of high impact features. I also ended up being the sole backend engineer supporting the new user onboarding process during the World Cup.</p>

<p>I later switched to the messaging team (working on SMS, push notifications and email) where I rewrote from scratch the entire infrastructure that interpreted text messages.</p>

<p>All in all, I left Twitter with an incredible breadth and depth of experience– having worked up and down the stack, in both existing codebases and greenfield projects, on my own and under the watchful eye of staff engineers. I gained an unreal amount of confidence in my engineering skills and more importantly, my ability to learn a new technology quickly.</p>



<p>In my early 20s, I got really into electronic dance music (EDM). I found myself going out dancing most Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Since San Francisco was home to numerous clubs, it became a chore to discover events. You basically had to go to each individual venue’s (often janky) website and navigate their calendars to find what was coming up. From there, specific event details were either on Facebook or ticketing platforms like Eventbrite, Ticketfly, etc.</p>

<p>I later found out from a friend that there used to be a popular site that aggregated all EDM events in the Bay Area until it eventually shut down. I thought this was a fantastic idea and well within my technical scope so I got to work.</p>

<p>I hammered out a minimal viable product (MVP) with Ruby on Rails (thanks to having learned this on the job at Twitter). The MVP was basically a one-pager with a list of manually-inserted events for the next 2 weeks. I started to tell my friends about the site and it quickly proved invaluable.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/futuraretro1.png" alt=""> <span>The first iteration of futuraretro</span></p>

<p>Fuelled by passion, I poured hours of effort every week into growing my site. I learned to incorporate the Gracenote API which would label each event with the specific genre of EDM. The Eventbrite and Ticketfly APIs helped automate adding new event details. I implemented a form where promoters could suggest upcoming shows. I started a Facebook page which grew to hundreds of followers. I sent out weekly emails via Mailchimp and made a few bucks every month with affiliate ads.</p>

<p>Over the course of several months, word of mouth continued to spread and my site ultimately peaked at 1000 weekly active users.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/futuraretro2.png" alt="">
<span>The second and last redesign of futuraretro</span></p>

<p>The coolest part (which I’ve yet to re-experience with Lunch Money) was when I met someone at a show. I asked them if they had heard of my site and they pulled up their phone to show me it was the last site they had visited. That blew my mind!</p>

<p>The eventual fade of my interest in EDM also meant the end of futuraretro. While it didn’t get anywhere significant, I strengthened my muscle of “learning by doing”. Since then, I’ve started a number of other micro-sites spawned from short-lived curiosities and interests. My first few projects did not end up being the breakthrough ones but they helped me get used to putting myself out there and launching things.</p>



<p>Moving out of San Francisco permanently and subsequently taking a sabbatical helped strip away the biases that were stemming from my environment. If you were to ask me when I was living in San Francisco my motivations for wanting to start a company, my honest answer would probably be related to boosting my ego, gaining clout among my Silicon Valley peers, or making a ton of money so I could afford a little condo in the Mission.</p>

<p><a href="https://lunchbag.ca/pre-departure-thoughts/">I took significant time off to travel in 2017</a>. I sought after experiences I knew I would never come across otherwise such as spending time <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/thailand/">in various abodes in Northeastern Thailand</a> and <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/lunchbag-in-france-living-in-the-mountains/">the French countryside</a>. Being in new and unfamiliar environments helped me see almost right away that I wanted to end up in Toronto. I was reminded of the other joys in life– family, nature and community, and <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/checking-in-things-i-ve-learned/">I gained clarity on myself</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/sabbatical.jpg" alt=""><span>Pure joy in the Burgundy countryside where I spent 5 weeks as a bartender and waitress at a French restaurant</span></p>

<p>It may seem drastic, but leaving behind all my comforts was my big ‘ah ha!’ moment. I don’t think it changed me as a person, rather, it allowed me to recalibrate for my desired life path without external influences.</p>

<p>Now that I have a better footing on my goals and values, I am rebuilding my life around that and I couldn’t be happier. See, if I wanted to make a bunch of money and make a name for myself, I would not be a solopreneur. Solopreneurship optimizes for freedom first, not money. And right now, running Lunch Money as a company of one while living in Taipei is exactly where I want to be.</p>

<p>My journey was largely influenced by my extensive technical background, and I’d love to take this space to highlight someone else’s story. <a href="https://allisonseboldt.com/">Allison Seboldt</a>, solo founder of <a href="https://fantasycongress.com/">Fantasy Congress</a> and a political sciences major, shares her approach into web development <a href="https://allisonseboldt.com/how-i-got-my-first-job-as-a-developer/">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
  <p>Relativity is one of my favorite topics in physics. Its origins were almost pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein's_thought_experiments">logic puzzle science</a>, which in my opinion is one of the most fun and satisfying types of science. Most people have a vague sense of what relativity is – the speed of light is finite, and something about time travel? – but they don’t really know what it is, which is too bad because the principles are very simple, and the results are pretty awesome.</p>

<p>There are two halves of relativity as Einstein developed it: special relativity and general relativity.</p>

<p>Special relativity is, at heart, two ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The laws of physics are the same to everyone everywhere, as long as they are using a non-accelerating (“inertial”) frame of reference.</li>
  <li>The speed of light in a vacuum is the same regardless of frame of reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before Einstein, these two things were widely considered to be paradoxical: how could it be that the speed of light is constant for everyone – its velocity is not added to your velocity, if you are moving – but also physics doesn’t depend on your perspective? What Einstein did was take both of these things seriously and realized that when you put them together, you get a space-time connection and lot of other really powerful stuff.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation">time dilation</a> immediately falls out. Imagine that you are standing on the platform of a train station while a train flies past, and your friend is onboard the train. If your friend puts a mirror on the ceiling of the train car and, lying on the floor, points a flashlight at it, he will see the light reflected back at him having gone up in a straight line and returned in a straight line to the floor. However, from your perspective on the platform, while the light is traveling up and down, it is also traveling sideways. This means the path it travels is <em>longer</em> than the path it appears to travel to your friend. Since the speed of light is constant, and the distance between the floor and the ceiling don’t change, from your perspective, time must be passing more slowly for your friend than for you. And indeed this is an experimentally tested real effect! (For example, you need to take it into account for GPS to work reliably.) It is important to note that your friend, on the train, never feels anything different: from their perspective, time is passing just fine at the same rate it always does. The effect is entirely about the difference in your perspectives.</p>

<p>The idea that the laws of physics are the same of everyone is sometimes called “general covariance” and is really important for the tractability of a description of physics overall. There isn’t necessarily a guarantee that it would be true in our universe, but it turns out that it is.</p>

<p>General relativity adds one more idea: when an observer is using an accelerating (“non-inertial”) frame of reference, the laws of physics might appear to be different, and that difference shows up as a gravitational field.</p>

<p>For example, if you are in a car accelerating on the highway and you throw a ball into the air, it will veer towards the back of the car. You know that this is because the car is accelerating - but it is also completely equivalent to model this as a gravitational field coming from the back of a non-accelerating car! In fact, the equivalence principle says that if you were in a windowless box that was either being accelerated by a rope or is in the presence of a gravitational field, there is no measurement you could make that would tell them apart.</p>

<p>The language of physics is math, and so while it’s easy to get the big ideas that underlie relativity, getting the full depth of the implications requires going to the equations. The math of special relativity is mostly pretty easy – you can get surprisingly far with high school level math – but general relativity is a completely different beast, and one of the reasons Einstein’s original GR papers are so challenging is because the math really required to do it well (e.g. differential geometry) didn’t exist at the time. Einstein had the realization that the universe has no sense of coordinates, just a way of measuring distances between events, which he described as “no prior geometry,” but it took a while for the full mathematical description of what this actually meant to be worked out.</p>

<p>Anyway, relativity is incredibly trippy and fascinating, so if you’ve liked this sneak peek I highly recommend checking out Einstein’s short 1916 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity:_The_Special_and_the_General_Theory">“Relativity: The Special and the General Theory”</a> which is written for laypeople and uses very little math while still walking you through the core of it all with Einstein’s unique incisive clarity. General relativity is certainly one of the most beautiful things in all of science (possibly <em>the</em> most; quantum field theory is very cool too, though it lacks the intrinsic elegance of GR), and I wish more people had the chance to understand and appreciate it.</p>

I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it.

Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Hold on! Before you call me crazy, please let me clarify. Yes, I am going to tell you how to handle C++ exceptions in C code,
but don't worry, I know this is a terrible idea, and (hopefully) no one is <em>actually</em> going to do that.</p>

<p>But why, you might ask, would anyone even begin to ponder such a silly idea? Well, poking things and making them do things they
aren't <em>supposed to</em> do is a excellent way to figure out how they work. And exception handling is certainly a very interesting
, and perhaps quite important, practical <strong>computer algorithm</strong>. So it's quite natural for someone to have curiosity about how it works.</p>

<p>Alright. But where do we even start? If you search for information on exception handling online, what you would find is
usually cryptic and incomplete documentation about ELF, Dwarf, and C++ ABI. Often they are difficult to understand, and it
is usually hard for someone to see how they all fit together.</p>

<p>So instead, let's work in reverse. Let's inspect something that actually does exception handling.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>throw_exception</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>throw_exception</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>e</span><span>){</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a baseline program that throws an exception and catches it. Let's try compiling it and see what comes out:</p>



<p>If you are wondering what <code>-S</code> does, it tells the compiler to stop after producing the assembly, without assembling or linking the code.
You should try this step yourself, and look at the assembly produced. Here, I picked out a few relevant snippets, and simplified them to
make them easier to read.</p>

<p>Let's look at the throwing side first:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>throw_exception</span><span>():</span>
<span>.LFB0:</span>
	<span>push</span>	<span>rbp</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>edi</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span>
	<span>call</span>	<span>__cxa_allocate_exception@PLT</span> <span>; &lt;----</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>QWORD</span> <span>PTR</span> <span>[</span><span>rax</span><span>],</span> <span>0</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>edx</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>
	<span>lea</span>	<span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>_ZTIDn</span><span>[</span><span>rip</span><span>]</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
	<span>call</span>	<span>__cxa_throw@PLT</span>              <span>; &lt;----</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are not used to looking at assembly, this might look quite daunting. But luckily, you don't have to know any assembly at all to pick out the interesting bits here:
<code>__cxa_allocate_exception</code> and <code>__cxa_throw</code>.</p>

<p>As their names suggest, <code>__cxa_allocate_exception</code> allocates space for the thrown exception, and <code>__cxa_throw</code> actually commences the throwing.
(the <code>__cxa_</code> bit probably means "cxx abi", I am not sure.) You don't have to take my words, you can find this information <a href="https://libcxxabi.llvm.org/spec.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are curious, you can find the code of <code>__cxa_throw</code> <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/a16da48bf19bb139e5461e5b5b7f072d5369b054/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/eh_throw.cc#L75">here</a>.
For the rest of us, we will move on to the catching side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>main:</span>
<span>.LFB1:</span>
	<span>push</span>	<span>rbp</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>

<span>.L7:</span>
	<span>cmp</span>	<span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
	<span>je</span>	<span>.L5</span>

<span>.LEHB1:</span>
	<span>call</span>	<span>_Unwind_Resume@PLT</span>
<span>.LEHE1:</span>
<span>.L5:</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
	<span>call</span>	<span>__cxa_begin_catch@PLT</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>QWORD</span> <span>PTR</span> <span>-</span><span>8</span><span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>],</span> <span>rax</span>

<span>.L8:</span> <span>; &lt;- this is a label</span>
	<span>leave</span>
	<span>ret</span> <span>; &lt;- this means "return"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(If you don't know how to read this assembly, you just need to know this: instructions which start with letter <code>j</code> mean jump. The thing which follows the jump instruction is a "label", which is also what the <code>.Lxxx:</code> you see in the code are.
The jump instruction will jump to the matching label when executed)</p>

<p>OK, here we spot <code>__cxa_begin_catch</code> and <code>__cxa_end_catch</code>, which seems to match the <code>catch</code> block in the source code. However, they don't seem to be reachable. If you follow the call to <code>throw_exception()</code>,
you can see after it returns, the code immediately jumps to <code>.L8</code>, which returns to the caller. So who is going to trigger the <code>catch</code> block?</p>

<p>Let's look a bit further into the assembly:</p>

        <span>.uleb128</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This assembly block defines <em>data</em>. After being assembled and linked, they become data bytes stored verbatim in the executable. And in there, we find a reference to <code>.L7</code>.
Look back at the code, we can see <code>.L7</code> contains a jump to <code>.L5</code>, which is the <code>catch</code> block.</p>

<p>From this, we can infer that, there is some information stored in the executable ("metadata"), which, when an exception is thrown, the throwers will read to figure out the code to run.</p>

<p>Alright, now we have a <span id="rough">rough</span> picture of how exception handling works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The thrower prepares the exception, then call <code>__cxa_throw</code></li>
  <li><code>__cxa_throw</code> looks through the metadata of the callers in the function call stack, to find a suitable handler</li>
  <li>The program jumps to the handler</li>
</ul>

<p>Looks simple, right? If we can <em>somehow</em> make the metadata of a <em>C</em> function declare: "hey, look here, I have an exception handler!", we will be done.</p>

<p>But, as you might know, there is no such thing as exceptions in the C language. There can't possibly be a way to declare a function as having an exception handler, right?</p>

<p>Well, there is not a <em>standard</em> way. But there is a way. There is this extension to C, implemented by the GCC compiler (and later Clang), which allows you to attach a
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Variable-Attributes.html#:~:text=cleanup">"cleanup"</a> function to a local variable. This cleanup function will be called when
the local variable goes out of scope.</p>

<p>Because of the excellent interoperability between C and C++, you can have the situation where an C++ exception is thrown "through" a C function. Normally, the cleanup functions
aren't going to run in that case. However, this makes people unhappy. So, now, there <em>is</em> a way to make them run.</p>

<p>Passing the <code>-fexceptions</code> option to GCC, makes it generate exception-aware code even when compiling C code. And in that mode, the cleanup functions will be registered as exception handlers! Just like the local variable destructors in C++.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// file1.cc</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>void</span> <span>throw_exception</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>extern</span>  <span>"C"</span> <span>void</span> <span>might_throw</span><span>();</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// OK, we have to have a try/catch in main,</span>
        <span>// because if C++ cannot find an actual `catch` block,</span>
        <span>// it will just abort(), without going through the throw</span>
        <span>// process at all.</span>
        <span>might_throw</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// file2.c</span>
<span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>throw_exception</span><span>();</span>
<span>void</span> <span>the_cleanup_function</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>stderr</span><span>,</span> <span>"cleanup called</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>void</span> <span>might_throw</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Call the_cleanup_function when `x` goes out of scope</span>
    <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>cleanup</span><span>(</span><span>the_cleanup_function</span><span>)))</span> <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>throw_exception</span><span>();</span>
    <span>fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>stderr</span><span>,</span> <span>"do more stuff</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span> <span>// we don't get to this point :'(</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Compile and run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g++ file1.cc <span>-c</span>
gcc file2.c <span>-fexceptions</span> <span>-c</span>
g++ file1.o file2.o
./a.out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will see it says:</p>

<pre><code>cleanup called
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at the assembly of <code>file2.c</code>, you will see structures very similar to the <code>try/catch</code> block in <code>file1.cc</code>.</p>

<p>OK, we are able to get a C function called during the handling of a <em>C++</em> exception. But this exception still propagated through the C function, which is
normal, given we didn't actually catch the signal. But what exactly is going on here? How did the control flow slip away from our hands?</p>

<p>Let's look at the assembly again:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>might_throw:</span>
<span>; ... skipped ...</span>
<span>.L7:</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
	<span>jmp</span>	<span>.L5</span>
<span>.L5:</span>
	<span>lea</span>	<span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>]</span>
<span>.LEHB2:</span>
	<span>call</span>	<span>the_cleanup_function</span>
	<span>mov</span>	<span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rbp</span>
	<span>call</span>	<span>_Unwind_Resume@PLT</span>
<span>; ... more skipped ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can easily see the call to <code>the_cleanup_function</code>, right after that, is a call to <code>_Unwind_Resume</code>. What does that do?</p>

<p>First of all, what does "unwind" mean here? You might have already known, the program needs to "unwind its stack" when an exception is thrown. Basically it has to remove entries on its call stack, until a handler is found.
Which is the process we already described <a href="#rough">above</a>.</p>

<p>So, inferring from the function name again, we can guess that <code>_Unwind_Resume</code> resumes an interrupted stack unwinding (which is, by the way,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201016174844id_/https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-S390/LSB-Core-S390/baselib--unwind-resume.html">correct</a>).
And our cleanup function does interrupt the unwind, so after the cleanup function returns, the program calls <code>_Unwind_Resume</code> to resume the unwinding.</p>

<p>Alright, <em>if</em>, we can stop that function from being called. If we can do that, we would have "caught" the exception.</p>

<p>Basically, we want <code>the_cleanup_function</code> to skip over everything in <code>might_throw</code> that is after the call to <code>the_cleanup_function</code>. Clearly, we need something that could interrupt the normal execution flow of the program.
<code>goto</code> is not enough, because our skip is cross-function. We need something stronger.</p>

<p>And there is indeed something stronger. <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>! A call to <code>longjmp</code> allows you to jump to a point in the program where you have previously called <code>setjmp</code> (the
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setjmp.3.html">man page</a> explains these functions very well). So we just need to use <code>setjmp</code> to put an anchor in the normal return path of <code>might_throw</code>, then have
<code>the_cleanup_function</code> jump to there with <code>longjmp</code>, and we would have skipped the <code>_Unwind_Resume</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a version of <code>might_throw</code> that does this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;
</span><span>struct</span> <span>Catch</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>jmp_buf</span> <span>env</span><span>;</span>

	<span>// The cleanup function will be called when the exception is thrown,</span>
	<span>// but then it will be called again when we return from `might_throw`.</span>
	<span>// We don't want it to perform the longjmp when `might_throw` is returning</span>
	<span>// normally, so we use a flag to indicate whether a longjmp should be</span>
	<span>// performed.</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>do_jump</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
<span>void</span> <span>the_cleanup_function</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Catch</span> <span>*</span><span>env</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>env</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>do_jump</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>longjmp</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>env</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>void</span> <span>might_throw</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>cleanup</span><span>(</span><span>the_cleanup_function</span><span>)))</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Catch</span> <span>env</span><span>;</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>setjmp</span><span>(</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>env</span><span>.</span><span>do_jump</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
		<span>throw_exception</span><span>();</span>
	<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>stderr</span><span>,</span> <span>"exception caught</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
		<span>env</span><span>.</span><span>do_jump</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
	<span>}</span>
	<span>fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>stderr</span><span>,</span> <span>"do more stuff after having caught the exception</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And running it, we get:</p>

<pre><code>exception caught
do more stuff after having caught the exception
</code></pre>

<p>Voilà! We have caught a C++ exception in C.</p>

<p>OK, are we done?</p>

<p>No! This result might be good enough, but I …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><a href="https://telemelt.com/">Telemelt</a> is a web-based multi-emulator (<a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>/<a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro</a>) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends.</p>
<p>Gathering around a TV and collectively attempting to beat a game has been a consistent joy throughout my life, and is one of the rituals I miss the most with the ones we're separated from right now. I wanted to create a way to play single player/hotseat games with friends remotely that was free and required minimal setup. Netplay has always been unsatisfying for this, since only the host had low enough latency for games that require tight timing. I started this project in March, and have been pouring my heart into it every day possible since then.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2F6dfcbe63-2f80-4bb3-a780-a48a51dc0a19.image.png?v=1602011998888" alt="collage"></p>
<p>The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience <strong>zero network latency</strong> for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Designed to be lowest hassle way to play emulated games with a friend or loved one, even if they are not tech savvy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No port forwarding, no IP addresses thanks to auto-generated URL</li>
<li>No installation or downloads, everything works in browser</li>
<li>Mappings for common/inexpensive controllers (PS3/4, XB360/1, Switch JC/Pro etc..) on both USB/BT thanks to RetroArch bindings</li>
<li>Always free! No tracking, no logins, no paid advertisements - personal budget allocated for Azure costs to serve thousands of users for months</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focus on the experience of passing <em>a single controller</em> between people</strong></p>

<li>User state error checked per frame and reconciled via <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> server if needed</li>
<li>Takes advantage of deterministic nature of certain libretro cores - like a broadcasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun">TAS</a></li>

<p>This post details my adventures with the Linux virtual memory subsystem, and my discovery of a creative way to taunt the OOM (out of memory) killer by accumulating memory in the kernel, rather than in userspace.</p>



<p>Keep reading and you’ll learn:</p>



<ul><li>Internal details of the Linux kernel’s demand paging implementation</li><li>How to exploit virtual memory to implement highly efficient sparse data structures</li><li>What page tables are and how to calculate the memory overhead incurred by them</li><li>A cute way to get killed by the OOM killer while appearing to consume very little memory (great for parties)</li></ul>



<h2>Part 1: Demand paging is nuanced</h2>



<p>As usual, the story begins with me asking questions about implementation details. This time, about the Linux kernel’s demand paging implementation.</p>



<p>In Operating Systems 101 we learn that operating systems are “lazy” when they allocate memory to processes. When you mmap() an anonymous page, the kernel slyly returns a pointer immediately. It then waits until you trigger a page fault by “touching” that memory before doing the real memory allocation work. This is called “demand paging”.</p>



<p>This is efficient — if the memory is never touched, no physical memory is ever allocated. This also means you can allocate virtual memory in vast excess of what is physically available (“overcommit”), which can be useful.<span id="easy-footnote-1-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-496" title="Some examples of applications that allocate immense virtual memory are Address Sanitizer and Webkit."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. You just can’t touch it all.</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper. Barring execution, “touching” memory means reading or writing. Writes to a new mmap’d region require the kernel to perform a full memory allocation. You need memory, you need it <em>now</em>, and the kernel can’t push it off any longer.</p>



<p>Now, the question: <strong>What about reads?</strong></p>



<p>Unlike writes, reads to a new mmap’d region do <em>not</em> trigger a memory allocation. The kernel continues to push off the allocation by exploiting how new anonymous mappings must be zero initialized. Instead of allocating memory, the kernel services the page fault using the “zero page”: a pre-allocated page of physical memory, completely filled with zeros. In theory this is “free” — a single physical frame can back all zero-initialized pages.</p>



<p>The point? <strong>Demand paging is nuanced — not all ways of accessing a new mapping require the kernel to allocate memory</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s see what this looks like in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.12/source/mm/memory.c#L4191">source</a>. The core page fault handler, <code>handle_mm_fault</code> is in <code>mm/memory.c</code>. A few calls deep via <code>__handle_mm_fault</code> and <code>handle_pte_fault</code>, we hit this block:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C"><code>static vm_fault_t handle_pte_fault(struct vm_fault *vmf)
{
	// ...

	if (!vmf-&gt;pte) {
		if (vma_is_anonymous(vmf-&gt;vma))
			return do_anonymous_page(vmf);
		else
			// ...
	}

	// ...
}</code></pre></div>



<p>Which leads us to <code>do_anonymous_page</code> — the core page fault handler for anonymous pages. </p>



<div><pre data-lang="C"><code>static vm_fault_t do_anonymous_page(struct vm_fault *vmf)
{
	// ...
	
	if (pte_alloc(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;pmd))
		return VM_FAULT_OOM;
	// ...

	/* Use the zero-page for reads */
	if (!(vmf-&gt;flags &amp; FAULT_FLAG_WRITE) &amp;&amp; // (1)
			!mm_forbids_zeropage(vma-&gt;vm_mm)) {
		entry = pte_mkspecial(pfn_pte(my_zero_pfn(vmf-&gt;address), // (2)
						vma-&gt;vm_page_prot));
		vmf-&gt;pte = pte_offset_map_lock(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;pmd,
				vmf-&gt;address, &amp;vmf-&gt;ptl);
		// ...
		goto setpte;
	}
	// ...
setpte:
	set_pte_at(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;address, vmf-&gt;pte, entry); // (3)
	// ...
	return ret;

	// ...
}</code></pre></div>



<p>Bingo. It checks whether a read caused the fault (1), then maps the virtual page to the zero page (2 and 3).</p>



<p>Note that this all happens in the page fault handler, which is an implementation choice. The mmap <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.12/source/mm/mmap.c#L1687">core logic</a> does not touch the page tables at all, and only records the presence of the new mapping. It leaves the mapping’s page table entry non-present (present bit = 0) which will trigger a page fault on access.</p>



<p>Alternatively, mmap could proactively allocate the page table entry, and initialize it to the zero page. This would avoid a page fault on the first read, but at the cost of initializing (potentially many) page table entries up front. Given that it’s most efficient to be maximally lazy, the current implementation is best.</p>



<h2>Part 2: Allocating infinite memory, and touching it too</h2>



<p>This led me to another question. Since reads from anonymous mappings are “free”, in addition to allocating excessive virtual memory, can’t you actually touch all of it? As long as that “touch” is a read?</p>



<p>Time for an experiment. Here’s some code that allocates 100 GB of linear memory, and tries to read from the first byte of each page. It allocates 512 MB at a time because I <a href="https://twitter.com/damageboy/status/1317676450393300994">incorrectly thought</a> you couldn’t mmap 100GB at once <s>you can’t directly ask mmap for 100 GB 🙂</s>.<span id="easy-footnote-2-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-496" title="Thanks to <a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/damageboy&quot;>@damageboy</a> for pointing this out."><sup>2</sup></a></span><span id="easy-footnote-3-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-496" title="This is lazy, dirty research code :) It is not sound or portable, and only just works because Linux happens to place the mmaps contiguously, growing down in memory."><sup>3</sup></a></span> My test system was a x64 Ubuntu 20.04 VPS.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

const size_t MB = 1024 * 1024;
const size_t GB = MB * 1024;

int main() {
  size_t alloc_size = 512 * MB;
  size_t total_alloc = 100 * GB;
  size_t num_allocs = total_alloc / alloc_size;

  // std::cout &lt;&lt; "alloc_size (MB)" &lt;&lt; alloc_size / (1024*1024)&lt;&lt; "\n";

  // std::cout &lt;&lt; "num_allocs " &lt;&lt; num_allocs &lt;&lt; "\n";

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Allocating mem...\n";

  char* base = nullptr;

  // Allocate a ton of memory
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; num_allocs; i++) {
    // Unsound alert - assuming allocations are contiguous and grow down.
    base = (char*)mmap(NULL, alloc_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
    if (base == MAP_FAILED) {
      perror(NULL);
      throw std::runtime_error("Fail");
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; (void*)base &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
  }

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Allocated Virtual Mem (GB): " &lt;&lt; total_alloc / GB &lt;&lt; "\n";
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Base Addr: " &lt;&lt; (void*)base &lt;&lt; "\n";
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Press enter to start reading.\n";
  getchar();
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Reading each page...\n";

  // Read the first byte of each page
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; total_alloc; i += 0x1000) {
    auto x = base[i];
  }

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Done!\n";
  getchar();
}</code></pre></div>



<p>When we run it, here’s what we see:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Bash"><code>$ ./demo

<p>htop confirms that 100 GB of virtual memory is allocated (VIRT column), but a much more reasonable 1540 KB of resident memory (RES) is actually occupying RAM. Note the MINFLT column — this is the number of “minor” page faults that have occurred. A minor page fault is one that does not require loading from disk. We will be triggering lots of these and should expect to see this number grow dramatically.</p>



<p>Here’s what happens after I press enter to trigger reading.</p>



<div><pre><code>0x7f26cd300000 198

Press enter to start reading.

<p>The process hits the “Done!” print. This means it successfully touched every page of the 100 GB allocation!</p>

<p>htop confirms that many minor faults have occurred. We would expect it to cause exactly 26214400 faults (100 GB / 4 KB), and indeed, 26214552 – 26214400 = 152, the number we started with. Intriguingly, the resident memory appears to have also increased, which should not have happened. See the <a href="#rss-spike">Appendix A</a> for discussion of this.</p>



<p>Here’s a video to see it all in action:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Allocating 100 GB and touching it all (Demand Paging Pt 1)" width="625" height="469" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYNMt6FWsI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>So the theory is confirmed! You can apparently “Allocate your memory, and touch it too” (as long as that touch is a read).</strong><span id="easy-footnote-4-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-496" title="Or if you prefer, the famous Henry Ford <a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/23494-any-customer-can-have-a-car-painted-any-colour-that&quot;>quote</a>:  &amp;#8220;You can touch as much memory as you want, as long as you are only reading&amp;#8221;."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>If your application, for some reason, benefits from the ability to have a 100 GB array of zeros then this is perfect for you. What about the rest of us?</p>



<p>A closer-to-real-life application is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">sparse array</a>. A sparse array is a (typically very large) array, whose elements are mostly zero. By exploiting demand paging, you can implement a memory efficient sparse array, where the majority of the array is backed by the zero page (or not even mapped). You get the fast indexing benefits of an array while avoiding the memory overhead.</p>



<h2>Part 3: Playing with a killer</h2>



<p>I have a confession. Remember when I said not all ways of accessing memory require the kernel to allocate memory? Yeah, that’s a lie.</p>



<p>Even though a read can be serviced by the shared zero page, that doesn’t mean no memory is allocated. Even the process of mapping a zero page requires allocating  memory. And here’s where we get into the nitty gritty.</p>



<h3>The hidden overhead of page tables</h3>



<p>The overhead comes from the virtual memory infrastructure itself — the page tables. Page tables are data structures that power the virtual memory subsystem. Like regular data structures, they occupy memory, only their overhead is easy to overlook, since it’s hidden from userspace.</p>



<p>This is what page tables on x86_64 look like:</p>
