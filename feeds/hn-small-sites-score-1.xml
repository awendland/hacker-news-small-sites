<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Learning online may have begun in the late 90s, but lately, it has been gathering a lot of attention. Especially due to the recent situation of the world with the pandemic and worldwide lockdown, e-learning has proved to be one of <em>the most</em> prominent uses of technology in the 21st century.</p><p>When the pandemic hit the world and all the educational institutions everywhere shut down, e-learning was there as our savior. Learning online was not a new concept to us, yet due to this, e-learning gained another, much more valuable reputation entirely. Now that we knew to learn online was that easy and that flexible, some people even started to question the hype of offline learning.</p><p>It is now safe to say that learning through the internet is a market that is just going to grow in the following few years. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-e-learning-market-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-over-14-during-the-period-20192025-301047035.html">Researches</a> even conclude that the market size of e-learning is expected to grow at a rate of 10.85% by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the question is why do you need to integrate personalization in e-learning. Well, the answer is a simple one: It makes the experience better and generates much more value for the learner. First things first, personalization is an important concept for most, if not all online business. <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">The scope of personalization</a> has grown so much that many enterprises will use it, or have already been leveraging it to generate value for their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s elaborate on why personalization will change the e-learning experience as a whole.</p><h3><strong>One Size</strong> <strong>Does Not</strong> <strong>Fit All&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We have left behind the days of pushing the same thing to everyone and anyone. People have preferences on the smallest aspects of their lives, so it is expected that personalization is included on other aspects as well, even in their online learning experience.&nbsp;</p><p>People might have their preferences on the devices they would want to use, the pace they want to follow, the subjects they want to learn and be recommended next, the format of learning (audio/video/text), and whatnot. So, the whole concept of one <em>size fits all </em>should be discarded and we should move towards more advanced approaches.</p><h3><strong>The Pace of Learning</strong></h3><p>We often underestimate the importance of the pace of learning when we are learning with a group of people crammed together in a classroom. The fact that people have different speeds of understanding the things being taught is usually neglected in offline learning.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why, in online learning, it is expected by the user to be able to personalize their speed of learning. There wouldn’t be much difference in online learning and learning in a school if you still have to rush to go to class on time and struggle to meet the speed of other students in the group.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Giving students the control</strong></h3><p>When the application is personalized, it will give students/learners more control of what they are experiencing through the e-learning app. This results in students being able to:</p><ol role="list"><li>Carefully think about their goals from the course they are doing</li><li>Set up their own learning path</li><li>Choose devices to study from that they are the most comfortable with</li><li>Study without the pressure and competitiveness of learning in a group&nbsp;</li><li>Study in various flexible speeds, suited to themselves</li><li>Get&nbsp; course recommendations on what they can learn next</li></ol><p>In the tech-driven world of 2020, you must give more thought to leveraging technology in your online business. Technology is evolving and bettering itself every day, and we must evolve according to it. We at Caboom believe that <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">personalization is the future</a>, and the e-learning industry must use it in their favor.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to recommender systems, the default choices are usually to use Collaborative Filtering that makes use of the wisdom of all the users, or Content-based Filtering that is based on the user's past interactions and item attributes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let's briefly have a look at the methods for generating recommendations and how they work.<br></p><h2>Collaborative Filtering</h2><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) is a method for generating recommendations by calculating preference scores of a user for an item using the historical preference for that item from other similar users in the database. This algorithm takes account of the explicit interaction with the item irrespective of the attributes of the item, so is domain agnostic as long as we have sufficient historical interaction data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It works with an assumption that if a user <strong>A</strong> likes item <em>X, Y, Z</em>, and user <strong>B</strong> likes product <em>X, Y, J</em> then user A will probably like item J and user B item Z.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Note that these predictions are specific to the user, but makes use of the interactions gathered from many users. This can lead to recommending a diverse set of items that the user might not otherwise have discovered.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This method is mostly used on e-commerce websites. If you have come across recommendations under a section titled "People who liked item X also liked item Y" you have seen Collaborative Filtering in action.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Content-Based Filtering</h2><p>In contrast to Collaborative Filtering, Content-based filtering (CBF) uses the attributes/features of the items directly to recommend items to a user. This is done by creating a "user profile" of the preferences of the user for each of these item attributes and then calculating other items most similar to the user's profile. This is done by representing a profile vector of the user in the same dimensions as the item attribute vector and calculating the weights based on users’ historical interaction with the items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the recommendations are specific to this user, as the model did not use any information from other users. Thus, this type of recommendation does not provide a diverse range of choices as they are only based on items a user has previously interacted with.&nbsp;</p><div><p>This type of recommendation focuses on personal choice or content and is very useful in Job Recommendations as the choice of the job for the user needs to take into account to have a perfect matching job.</p></div><h2>Hybrid Recommender Systems</h2><p>As useful as these methods are they do have some limitations that we need to be aware of. For example, both CF and CBF do not work for new users for whom we don't have any historical interactions or have very few of them. They also don’t make use of other information we might have about the user like their demographic, location etc.<br></p><p>Ideally, we would like to make use of all the information available in diﬀerent data sources and also combine the algorithmic strengths of various recommender systems to make more robust recommendations. Hybrid recommender systems are used for these purposes, and we explore them more through the rest of this blog.<br></p><p>Most recommender systems these days use a hybrid approach by combining CF and CBF approaches. However, there is no reason why several other techniques cannot be hybridized.&nbsp;</p><p>Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>Making content-based and collaborative-based recommendations separately and then combining them.&nbsp;</li><li>Adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa).</li><li>Unifying the approaches into one model.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Several studies that empirically compare the performance of hybrid recommenders with pure CF and CBF methods have shown that hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as the cold start and the sparsity problem.</p><p>Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. The website makes recommendations by comparing the view and search habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering for recommender systems</h2><p>Given the many ways recommenders can be combined, there are many variations of hybrid recommenders in use. In this blog we will focus on one of the earliest and most successful hybrid recommender algorithms called <strong>Content boosted Collaborative Filtering</strong> (CBCF) algorithm.<br></p><p>CBCF is a type of hybrid recommendation technique that uses a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Its main idea is to overcome the sparsity problem that degrades the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms by using item content to make the user-item interaction matrix dense.<br></p><p>Its benefits over the pure CF and CBF methods are:</p><ol role="list"><li>Reduces user-item data sparsity</li><li>Handles <strong>cold-start problems</strong> when users have no or very few interactions.</li><li>Handles <strong>first rater problem</strong> for new items who have not been rated or interacted with by any users.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><h2>How does content boosted collaborative filtering work?</h2><p>As we mentioned the basic idea behind CBCF is to use content-based filtering to convert a sparse user interaction matrix to a dense matrix, and then use CF to make the recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>This is shown in Figure 1.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577b91af0b55804e61cec_61SMAsWQOTUzrv77PH-A5Voc8xzh1zEn28bIgaSt3jQUZwnQjxJ21NNPN2mduVdi7e_mjKryaLOwdQFmVMqrirhenUgFu-AxaRDuOtCfEi4ajWFEaTcAhEfG_ZnE025Uo2de3qk.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fig 1. Basic mechanism of of converting sparse matrix to dense</figcaption></figure><p>The overall architecture of the recommendation system is shown in Figure 2.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba90654535d9f5beb2_1ShNtwf2KCq2yeFqoxvxiXOLaS9PphLCMJa0E7NXDlCRgsIiHmGQBslVvtSVH-g56m0Ty3USspQFE1-uSyiOONy6cl_DMZuZliADv-97_aUqnI_OvIzqWRXK-mZRpJP0z37jJc8.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>&nbsp;Fig 2. Architecture of CBCF based recommender system&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>This architecture tries to predict the preference for items not yet interacted by the user based on the similar items rated by the user. For this, it groups the most similar interacted items based on the content and then gives weights to each of these neighboring items based on user preferences. The average of these weighted content feature vectors is then used to calculate the predicted preference for the item. This way we will have a predicted score for each item for a user, which becomes the new user-item dense matrix.&nbsp;</p></div><h2>Variation using Deep Learning Prediction Model for better recommendation</h2><p>With the advent of modern deep learning techniques, several variations of the content-based model have been developed. These methods create an item profile (feature vector) that are especially useful for text based features that are prevalent like item reviews, description etc.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba2ba25e595d015e23_pJgAoZtYFVWa_F0xBnr7__Qku6CdsmMxdV6D-clAH_ObVvlTvMU-wCRyicVumj61SxiP0-esr28yxbvaDGLvuAEEWG7FlC4A48-vNpZNZ-ett7zyaWPHM6gTlX0cOddXzl_78F4.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>	Fig 3. Variation using Deep Learning based Item Profiles</figcaption></figure><p>In this method, the item profiles are created using feature engineering techniques as before, but not grouped into clusters. The user profile is created based on the historical item interaction. Those two profiles are then combined into a single feature and the deep learning model is trained. After the model is created, the feature is created by combining the item profile not interacted by the user with the user profile, hence a prediction is generated which is used to make the sparse matrix dense.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Evaluation and Result<br></h2><p>In order to test the algorithm we used the <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/">MovieLens 20M Dataset</a> that is widely used for recommender system testing and benchmarking..&nbsp;<br></p><p>The results we got can be seen below.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pure CF method based on SVD Matrix Factorization</strong><br></p><p>The default sparsity of the user-item matrix was <strong>99.28%</strong>, and the average RMSE error tends to be around 1.0682 with minimum standard deviation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577bac716622a7dacc942_IF0tXRDyIDjRnbsYn9Rc300V1lHQL41S3SV2chFmBFguNOfZrNwV45wGJGrG9yOd-6xxFvX0Qo1A2zwxvO_sQ2T_VOrECCcVUZXsIcybfSCBIUha6O59hgG2KSpj6De_wmZ5un0.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Hybrid Recommender using&nbsp; CBCF</strong><br></p><p>After applying the CBCF algorithm using a content-based filter, the sparsity 0 as all uninterested item preferences are replaced by the predicted value. The average RMSE tends to be around 0.1099.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba78093ab286304374_XdvIsW4av8HvhnXwsR3Clo_4WaEPgJN4Au2JFZLA1jeUsoBKiIeTvcIvbkDknbHnP9b8kW_M6AEOkhxJR-5OXLX-aqmolqZvRqITmQtBYeM_ILPUr74IsEyva0FuqjhHVS2NxwU.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we can see both the RMSE and MAE values have decreased considerably for the CBCF model as compared to the pure CF method.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The time required to fit (train) and test the model does increase considerably using the hybrid method. This is something that needs to be taken into consideration in production use-cases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In conclusion, we have seen that the type of recommendation engine algorithm needs to be chosen based on the type of dataset we have. Standard Collaborative Filtering methods although very popular and useful do not always work, especially when the data is very sparse.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For user-specific recommendations where the user preferences data is available and a high degree of personalization sought Content-based filtering methods are useful. Collaborative filtering will work better when there is explicit feedback given and data sparsity isn't too high. Hybrid recommendation methods like Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering takes the advantages of both content and collaborative filtering when we have item attributes, and improves the models by removing data sparsity and reducing errors.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-implementing-smart-contract-edsl-in-haskell">previous post</a>, we introduced Lorentz base syntax which allows one to write code in the following manner:</p><pre><code>

<span>distance</span> :: [<span>Integer</span>, <span>Integer</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Natural</span>]
<span>distance</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup; mul
  dip $ <span>do</span> dup; mul
  add; isNat
  <span>if</span> <span>IsSome</span> <span>then</span> nop
  <span>else</span> push [mt|<span>Something</span> went wrong|]; failWith
</code></pre><p>Michelson provides several basic primitives types and ways to group them in products (<code>pair</code>) and sums (<code>or</code>), and we still follow this behaviour.
As noted in a <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-complex-objects">spin-off post about Lorentz objects</a>, the opportunity to group types into a sum of products corresponds to Haskell’s datatypes, but one other feature remains unused.</p><p>In this post, we will talk about Haskell <em>newtypes</em> and why they can be a powerful tool in a smart contract eDSL like Lorentz.</p><details>
  <summary>A note about type signature syntax.</summary>
<p>In this article, we are going to write <code>[a, b] :-&gt; [c, d]</code> in signatures, rather than <code>a : b : s :-&gt; c : d : s</code>, for simplicity.
The reader may notice that such methods will not be general enough, but Lorentz has a <code>framed</code> function which makes any given instruction polymorphic over a stack tail, so that is not a big concern.</p>
<p>Also, by Haskell rules, lists of types with less than two elements have to be prefixed with a tick to avoid ambiguity with plain lists.</p>
</details><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p><em>Newtype</em> is a type that is a mere wrapper over another already existing type but may have its custom semantics.
Newtypes are supposed to be free in terms of performance and only affect the type-checking stage, so they allow stricter correctness guarantees to be verified at compile time.</p><p>We have encountered two kinds of real-life examples where newtypes are useful:</p><h3 id="distinguishing-different-entities-with-the-same-representation">Distinguishing different entities with the same representation</h3><p>For instance, it is common for advanced token smart contracts to allow participants to have multiple addresses with money.
The user probably wants to know the balances of those addresses, and eventually, we may need to have three methods for that:</p><pre><code>
<span>getAddressBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getParticipantBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getOwnerBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]
</code></pre><p>When using these methods in the form they are mentioned, types don’t help us at all.
It is possible to apply <code>getOwnerBalance</code> to an address of a participant by mistake.</p><p>If we manage to make bad code like this impossible to write, that should improve the development experience and correctness of the resulting contracts.</p><h3 id="types-with-invariants">Types with invariants</h3><p>Let’s imagine that business logic assumes you have several flags for each address: whether it is locked by the user, whether the user should be notified by e-mail on balance change, whether the user’s cat is authorized to spend money from this address, &lt;insert your own&gt;.</p><p>A general efficient way to represent such a flag set is by keeping a numeric bitmask.
Following the fail-fast principle, you want to ensure that an invalid bitmask is not produced at any stage across the contract.
And, actually, there might be many places whether the bitmask can become invalid – contract origination, separate flag changes (in case some flags can contradict with others), and changes as a whole (batch update by user). You would like to make sure that no validity check is missing in any of these places.</p><p>In general Haskell code, such problems are often solved by declaring a newtype with explicitly stated invariants and providing constructors/modifiers which treat those invariants.</p><h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2><p>In Lorentz, we declare newtypes as follows:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>MyType</span> = <span>MyType</span> <span>Integer</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Let us remind that <code>IsoValue</code> describes how Lorentz types are translated into Michelson, and the <code>deriving newtype</code> clause is Haskell’s syntax that says that behaviour of <code>IsoValue</code> should be inherited from the inner type, <code>Integer</code> in our case.</p><p>Now one can write:</p><pre><code><span>putDefaultMyType</span> :: '[] :-&gt; '[<span>MyType</span>]
<span>putDefaultMyType</span> = push (<span>MyType</span> <span>0</span>)
</code></pre><p>That was simple.</p><p>The main benefit we get is that <code>MyType</code> is treated as a type completely different from <code>Integer</code> or any other newtype wrapper over <code>Integer</code>, so misapplying a function to a wrong argument would raise a compilation error.</p><p>Now we would like to have dedicated methods for converting between newtype and its inner representation.
Lorentz already defines <code>forcedCoerce_</code> method that converts between any two types having the same Michelson representation, but it is pretty broad and requires special care from the developer to be used correctly: a typo or a wrong mental model is pretty likely to cause a bug, so this method should be avoided in business logic layer.</p><p>We would like to allow users to be specific in their intentions via methods specialized to newtype wrapping/unwrapping. For this reason, we define the following methods:</p><pre><code><span>coerceWrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a] :-&gt; '[a]
<span>coerceWrap</span> = forcedCoerce_

<span>coerceUnwrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[a] :-&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a]
<span>coerceUnwrap</span> = forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><details>
  <summary>One more note about type signatures.</summary>
<p>Being part of the library, these two methods are of course defined in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/99fbc99defdedd02568f59cc692c0f021cc9209e/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Coercions.hs#L90">more generic way</a></p>
</details><p>Note the <code>Wrappable a</code>: when our newtype does not have any invariants and can be wrapped and unwrapped safely, we declare it to have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/0574c85b78214129b5673b0f8e09b0761711522f/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Wrappable.hs#L20"><code>Wrappable</code></a> instance.
It looks like this:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>Participant</span> = <span>Participant</span> <span>Address</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> stock (<span>Generic</span>)
  <span>deriving</span> anyclass (<span>IsoValue</span>, <span>Wrappable</span>)

<span>authenticate</span> :: '[<span>Participant</span>] :-&gt; '[]
<span>authenticate</span> = <span>do</span>
  coerceUnwrap  
  sender        
  assertEq [mt|<span>Method</span> executed not by the expected participant|]
</code></pre><p>We deem <code>coerceWrap</code> to be always safe: if a given newtype has invariants, it should not instantiate <code>Wrappable</code> typeclass in favor of another way we will consider a bit later.</p><h3 id="newtypes-with-invariants">Newtypes with invariants</h3><p>Now let us consider the previously mentioned example with bitmasks.
As before, we declare a dedicated newtype:</p><pre><code>

<span><span>newtype</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> { <span>unFlags</span> :: <span>Natural</span> }</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>And there were three use cases for it which we wanted to support.
The first one is constructing a Haskell value that can later be provided in contract origination.
This can be done safely in various ways using built-in Haskell features and is up to the developer.</p><details>
  <summary>We would implement it as follows.</summary>
<pre><code>
<span>flag1</span>, flag2, flag3 :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>flag1</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>1</span>
<span>flag2</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>2</span>
<span>flag3</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>4</span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Semigroup</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  a &lt;&gt; b = <span>Flags</span> (unFlags a .|. unFlags b)


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Monoid</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  mempty = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>



<span>
<span>instance</span> <span>Bounded</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  minBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>
  maxBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>7</span>


<span>myCustomFlags</span> :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>myCustomFlags</span> = mconcat [flag1, flag2]




</code></pre>
</details><p>Next, we need to make sure that contract code never produces an invalid value when operating with <code>Flags</code>.
Michelson has many polymorphic operations (<code>ADD</code>, <code>NOT</code>, <code>OR</code>), and it so happened that in Lorentz, one has to explicitly declare which of these operations are permitted for the introduced types.
In our case, this is actually handy: if we allow only logical operations on our <code>Flags</code> type, then its invariants will never get violated during contract execution.</p><pre><code>
<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>



</code></pre><p>In case some flags can contradict  each other, we would rather define a special function that adds flags with care:</p><pre><code>
<span>addFlag1</span> :: '[<span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>addFlag1</span> = <span>do</span>
  ... 
  push flag1
  uniteFlagsUnsafe

<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> :: [<span>Flags</span>, <span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> = <span>do</span>
  forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>; dip (forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>);
  or
  forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><p>Using this set of coercions may seem to make the contract less efficient, but because of the optimizer (which any eDSL should have for various reasons), these <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will not appear in the resulting Michelson code.</p><p>Finally, the last case is accepting a user-provided value.
This can be useful when the user wants to overwrite the existing value of a flag, and we need to make sure that his input is indeed valid.
Here, newtype helps us draw a line between checked data we can work with or store (<code>Flags</code>) and yet unchecked data we accept as input (let it be just <code>Natural</code> for simplicity).</p><pre><code>
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> = forcedCoerce_


<span>toFlags</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlags</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup
  push (maxBound @<span>Flags</span>); forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>IsLe</span>
  <span>then</span> <span>do</span> push [mt|<span>Invalid</span> flags value|]; pair; failWith @(<span>MText</span>, <span>Natural</span>)
  <span>else</span> toFlagsUnsafe
</code></pre><p>The bottom line: in Lorentz, one can use newtypes in a very similar way to how it usually happens in general Haskell code.
Some wrap/unwrap boilerplate in the form of <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will still be involved, but now the type system will assist you in ensuring that all the data is used correctly.</p><h2 id="common-questions">Common questions</h2><h3 id="do-i-need-types-if-i-can-write-tests%3F">Do I need types if I can write tests?</h3><p>While types are not meant to fully replace tests, a single newtype wrapper can eliminate the need for an entire category of tests just because buggy code cannot be written using safe primitives anymore.
Furthermore, the type system hints the developer if some check is missing.
This is an especially useful property for library writers, as their users also get a piece of that safety automatically.</p><p>Also (this point is often not taken into account) tests may form quite a large codebase that also has to be maintained, so you would like to avoid writing repetitive tests for trivial failure cases where possible.</p><p>For more details, I recommend Ken Fox’s <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/09/typed-language-tdd-part1/">article</a> explaining why it is beneficial to have both types and tests.</p><h3 id="what-about-formal-verification%3F">What about formal verification?</h3><p>Unlike the described newtypes approach, formal verification allows you to express arbitrary properties of your data and thus has a significantly broader scope.</p><p>However, in practice its use is pretty complicated:</p><ol>
<li>You may need to know a special proof assistant language like Coq to verify your programs;</li>
<li>You have to write proofs yourself.</li>
</ol><p>This way, formal verification may often be infeasible for large contracts.</p><p>On the other hand, newtypes feature lets you put a constraint only on one piece of data at a time, so, for instance, <code>amount &gt; 0 || storage.x &gt; 0</code> …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi">Short Intro to Schema Types in AsyncAPI<a href="#short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>There are many different schema formats that one might use to describe the message payload. Not everyone uses JSON Schema. There are multiple formats out there, like RAML 1.0 Data Types, Avro, or even OpenAPI 3.0. When you write your AsyncAPI file, you should not manually convert schemas that you already store somewhere in a format different from AsyncAPI Schema. The best practice is to reuse existing schemas by referring to them in your AsyncAPI file and making sure that the Message object has information about the schema format within the schemaFormat parameter.</p>

<p>AsyncAPI <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0/#messageObjectSchemaFormatTable" target="_blank">lists schema types</a> that are a MUST but is not limited to this list only. RAML Data Types is not a MUST HAVE, yet we already have a custom parser for it.</p>

<p>From the AsyncAPI tooling perspective, we have a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/" target="_blank">basic JavaScript Parser</a> capable of parsing schema of the payload provided with AsyncAPI schema format or JSON schema format. Other schema parsers are plugins that you can register with a parser, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/openapi-schema-parser" target="_blank">OpenAPI 3.0</a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/raml-dt-schema-parser" target="_blank">RAML 1.0 Data Types</a>. You could provide such plugins as well for your custom formats.</p>

<h3 id="avro-parser">Avro Parser<a href="#avro-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The 3rd plugin that we now officially support is related to Avro schema type. The first minor version is already out there, and you can give it a try, even if your schemas are in the Confluent Schema Registry. Have a look at the docs of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/avro-schema-parser" target="_blank">the Avro schema parser</a>. The Avro parser is also part of the latest release candidate of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">the Generator</a>. Please help us make it work for you.</p>

<h2 id="circular-references-in-asyncapi">Circular References in AsyncAPI<a href="#circular-references-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Now JavaScript Parser can handle circular references that you might have in your AsyncAPI files. The current implementation fully dereferences circular references, and you cannot change this behavior. We also extended the API to help you out to deal with circular references:</p>

<ul>
<li>The core AsyncAPI model now contains the hasCircular() function that you can use to determine at the very beginning if a given AsyncAPI document contains some circular references or not. An example use case for it is to throw a proper error message to the user with a clear message that circular references are not supported by your tool at the moment,</li>
<li>The Schema model contains isCircular() function to check if a given schema is circular, so you do not have to detect it on your own and adequately react</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/pull/94/files" target="_blank">this</a> pull request for implementation details. The work is still in progress as nice features in the Parser do not mean now all the Generator’s templates will support it. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/issues/83#issuecomment-659958312" target="_blank">this</a> comment if you need more details.</p>

<h2 id="typescript-support-in-parser">TypeScript Support in Parser<a href="#typescript-support-in-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Since Parser 0.27 we will now always generate <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/blob/master/types.d.ts" target="_blank">TypeScript types</a> to make it much easier for TypeScript developers to use Parser in their tools.</p>

<h2 id="generator-release-candidate-7-is-out">Generator Release Candidate 7 is out<a href="#generator-release-candidate-7-is-out" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>We just released another release candidate that contains a lot of improvements that we added to the Parser. It also includes the above mentioned <code>avro-schema-parser</code> so it is easier for you to test it out. Give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues">Publish vs Subscribe Discussion Continues<a href="#publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>We noticed that people that interact with AsyncAPI for the first time are confused about the meaning of those two words, publish and subscribe. Without going much into detail and oversimplifying things, we can say that this is the part of the community that considers using AsyncAPI to describe their internal broker-centric architecture. In such cases, you want to describe the application’s behavior and not what others can do with it. You want to use the Publish verb to specify that your application publishes to a given channel. What if your application is exposed to the outside world where others can interact with it? You want Publish to mean something different, like it is now, that it means your application is subscribed to a given channel, so that you can publish to it, and the application will receive a message.</p>

<p>Event-driven architectures are complex beasts with many patterns, and we should try to make AsyncAPI a single home for all of them. Please engage in this discussion, share your thoughts, and help us out to find the best solution:</p>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>

<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>

    <div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We are taking a practical approach in the following sections. As such, we need the right tools and environments available in order to keep up with the examples and exercises. We will be using <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> along with packages that will form our scientific stack, such as <code>ndarray</code> (for multi-dimensional containers) and <code>plotly</code> (for interactive graphing), etc. We will write all of our code within a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but you are free to use other IDEs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Miniconda">Install Miniconda<a href="#Install-Miniconda">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to get up and running with an environment that will facilitate our work. One approach I can recommend is to install and use Miniconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.</p>
<p>— <cite>https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can skip Miniconda entirely if you prefer and install Jupyter Lab directly, however, I prefer using it to manage other environments too.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions for Miniconda on <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">their website</a>, but if you're using Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you can execute the following commands from in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</pre></div>
<p>This will download the installation files and start the interactive installation process. Follow the process to the end, where you should see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for installing Miniconda3!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that's left is to close and re-open the terminal window.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Create-Your-Environment">Create Your Environment<a href="#Create-Your-Environment">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Once Miniconda is installed, we need to create and configure our environment. If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.</p>
<p>Now we can create and configure our conda environment using the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda create -n darn <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3</span></pre></div>
<p>You can replace <code>darn</code> (<strong>D</strong>ata <strong>An</strong>alytics with <strong>R</strong>ust <strong>N</strong>otebooks) with a name of your choosing.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>This will create a conda environment named <code>darn</code> with the latest Python 3 package ready to go. You should be presented with a list of packages that will be installed and asked if you wish to proceed. To do so, just enter the character <code>y</code>. If this operation is successful, you should see the following output at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Preparing transaction: <span>done</span>
Verifying transaction: <span>done</span>
Executing transaction: <span>done</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To activate this environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda activate darn</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To deactivate an active environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda deactivate</span></pre></div>
<p>As the message suggests, you will need to type the following command to activate and start entering commands within our environment named <code>darn</code>.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you should see your terminal prompt now leads with the environment name within parentheses:</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The example above shows the macOS machine name "melica" and the user "shahin". You will see something different on your machine, and it may appear in a different format on a different operating system such as Windows. As long as the prompt leads with "(darn)", you are on the right track.</p>
</div>
<p>This will allow you to identify which environment you are currently operating in. If you restart your machine, you should be able to use <code>conda activate darn</code> within your conda prompt to get back into the same environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Packages">Install Packages<a href="#Install-Packages">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If your environment was already configured and ready, you would be able to enter the command <code>jupyter lab</code> to launch an instance of the Jupyter Lab IDE in the current directory. However, if we try that in our newly created environment, we will receive an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span>darn<span>)</span> melica:~ shahin$ jupyter lab
-bash: jupyter: <span>command</span> not found</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>So let's fix that. Let's install Jupyter Lab and use the <code>-y</code> option which automatically says "yes" to any questions asked during the installation process.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>jupyterlab</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>.1.4 -y</pre></div>
<p>We'll also need <code>cmake</code> later on.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c anaconda cmake -y</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's install nodejs. This is needed to run our Jupyter Lab extension in the next section.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge nodejs -y</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">Install Jupyer Lab Extensions<a href="#Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There's one last thing we need to do before we move on, and that's installing any Jupyter Lab extensions that we may need. One particular extension that we need is the plotly extension, which will allow our Jupyter Notebooks to render our Plotly visualisations. Within your conda environment, simply run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension</pre></div>
<p>This may take some time, especially when it builds your jupyterlab assets, so keep an eye on it until you're returned control over the conda prompt, i.e. when you see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to install the purple looking theme from Figure 1 above.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @shahinrostami/theme-purple-please</pre></div>
<p>Now we're good to go!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Rust">Install Rust<a href="#Install-Rust">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install Rust using rustup, but you can check out the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">other installation methods</a> if you need them.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p>You will be given instructions for adding Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This will work until your close your terminal, so make sure to add it to your shell profile. I use Z shell (Zsh) so this meant adding the following to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span></pre></div>
<p>You can make sure everything works by closing and re-opening your terminal and typing <code>cargo</code>. If this returns the usage documentation then you're all set.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Don't forget to activate your environment when opening the terminal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Let's test if everything is working as it should be. In your conda prompt, within your conda environment, run the following command</p>

<p>This should start the Jupyter Lab server and launch a browser window with the IDE ready to use.</p>

<p><img src="https://shahinrostami.com/images/rust-notebooks/fresh_jupyter.png" alt="Jupyter Lab With Rust">
</p>
<center><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - A fresh installation of Jupyter Lab.</p></center>
<p>Let's create a new notebook. In the Launcher tab which has opened by default, click "Rust" under the Notebook heading. This will create a new and empty notebook named <code>Untitled.ipynb</code> in the current directory.</p>
<p>If everything is configured as it should be, you should see no errors. Type the following into the first cell and click the "play" button to execute it and create a new cell.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[2]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>If we followed all the instructions and didn't encounter any errors, everything should be working. We should see "Hello World!" in the output cell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#Conclusion">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>In this section, we've downloaded, installed, configured, and tested our environment such that we're ready to run the following examples and experiments. If you ever find that you're missing Jupyter Lab packages, you can install them in the same way as we installed Jupyter Lab and the others in this section.</p>

			<p>“Blank canvas syndrome” is a paralysis you face as a creative when you’re starting a new project. If you’ve ever found yourself staring hopelessly at a blank computer screen at a loss for where to begin then you know how debilitating blank canvas syndrome can be. Fortunately we have a master artisan we can model who taught us through his 30-season TV show how to beat this paralysis. </p>
<p><img src="https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="437" srcset="https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome.jpg 800w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-300x164.jpg 300w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-768x420.jpg 768w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-610x333.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>What would Bob do?</h2>
<p>I grew up watching a TV show called “<a href="https://www.bobross.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross</a>.” Day after mesmerizing day this soft-spoken dude with the huge afro would convert a blank canvas into a work of art over the course of a 30min show. It was hypnotizing to watch him repeatedly actuate his vision out of nothing and step you through his thought process the whole way with his signature gentle, supportive style.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to do my best to channel Bob Ross and spell out the advice I believe he would give us if he were alive today coaching us on how to build an application from scratch via nocode. The key, as with most layered creative challenges, is to peel it back one layer at a time and use reverse goal planning to start with the end in mind and work in layers moving from your big daunting idea to a fully-functional app. So let’s begin, friend.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Crystalize your vision with an aspirational press release</h2>
<p>Mental gridlock can originate from a handful of causes but almost always traces back to an ill-defined vision. One of the best exercises for getting crystal clarity on your vision up front is a technique I synthesized from two sources: an Innovation Game called “<a href="https://www.innovationgames.com/remember-the-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Remember the Future</a>” and how Amazon does its product development via its “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/answer/Ian-McAllister" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working backwards</a>” methodology.</p>
<p>The gist of the technique is to imagine forward to some future point in time at which you’ve released your shiny new application and are publishing a celebratory press release that touts the benefits to your user. The process of writing that future press release accomplishes a few things, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>It gets you thinking in terms of users and benefits and how to message the value proposition to your target audience. If you struggle with this exercise will reveal exactly where the holes are currently in your understanding of the landscape, market, product, etc.</li>
<li>It yields an artifact that will be useful to you later as a north star by which you can make product decisions and ensure a team is all operating on the same page. It’s essentially a roll-up of a bunch of user stories into a concise high-level document which consequently….</li>
<li>Allows you to deconstruct this vision in the next step to yield your constituent user stories.</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of the mechanism of <em>how</em> this works, the theory is that by projecting forward and remembering hypothetically backwards of what must have occurred up to that point to make the product possible you use different set of neural circuitry vs. trying to speculate forward from today. I admittedly don’t understand the psychological mechanism behind <em>why</em> this subtly different approach actually works but I can vouch anecdotally that it <em>does</em> work.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ross Equivalent Advice (BREA)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=56" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prep the canvas</a> and get clear on your idea. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Write your aspirational press release for your proposed application. Bonus if you post it somewhere publicly and use it as a commitment instrument. If you need inspiration read the linked Quora article above. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rkXhFeQpNyEF8_XRwad0nRgLcTUVroQWGCtwikWUAJc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here is mine</a> for v2 of the Charity Makeover platform.</em></p>
<h2>Step 2: Capture conceptual requirements of the MVP via User Stories</h2>
<p>The next step once you have your aspirational press release is to deconstruct that document into user stories that capture the essential requirements of your minimum viable product (MVP).</p>
<p>User stories allow you to express functional requirements while remaining at a conceptual level (ie. not worrying about user experience – UX) and thinking in terms of stakeholders, goals and acceptance criteria. If you’re new to user stories I highly recommend <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101y2AAEsTeFxTQn4=/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this half-day course on Udemy</a> for getting up to speed on how to use them effectively.</p>
<p>A way to get started here if you’re struggling is to take each of the main benefits you wrote about in your aspirational press release and think about the discreet blocks of functionality that would need to exist for each in order to enable it. You want to restrict your initial user stories to the bare minimum set of functionality necessary to deliver your MVP. Resist the temptation to go overboard in documenting every conceivable function your app might need to perform and keep it constrained to only those stories which directly support the benefits you enumerated in your press release. </p>
<p>You can use any tool to capture these. I’m a fan of Trello as it’s a free tool and allows you to put the user story in the title of each Trello card, any supporting explanation in the description and your acceptance criteria as a checklist on the card. I use a simple 4-column layout of: backlog, MVP, in progress, and completed.</p>
<p>Further explanation of user stories is beyond the scope of this post. The Udemy course referenced above is a fantastic resource for quickly learning the 80/20 essence of how to craft effective user stories.</p>
<p><strong>BREA:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=233" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Layer in the background</a> and add some fluffy clouds. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Create a <a href="https://trello.com/seantierney3/recommend" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free Trello account</a> and load it up with the user stories that represent the bare minimum functionality of your MVP. Go to sleep and review it the next day. Does it capture all the key functionality? If not add new stories until you cover all the major bases. Is there anything that’s overkill feature-wise for the MVP? If so, move those story cards to the backlog column. Here are <a href="https://trello.com/b/5JwvBfEw/cm-honey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my user stories</a> for the v2 Charity Makeover build.</em></p>
<h2>Step 3: Create a low-fidelity wireframe</h2>
<p>Once you have your user stories you’re ready to move from the purely conceptual expression of the app into a rough visual sketch of the user experience (UX). The key here is to stay decidedly low-fidelity and not get derailed committing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">precision error</a> by moving too prematurely to a hi-fi prototype. This is the intermediary step that is most tempting to skip in favor of jumping directly to building the clickable hi-fi mockup. But that’s a mistake that will lead to unnecessary angst. </p>
<p>There are a number of applications like <a href="https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Balsamiq Mockups</a> for doing this part on the computer but I’ve found what works best is to ditch tech, stand in front of a white board and just start sketching screens.</p>
<p>Draw empty containers that mimic the proportions of the target screen resolution of your app (if you’re doing a mobile app, divide the whiteboard into a set of 8 or so rectangles that are roughly the same proportions of a mobile phone screen). Next you’ll work through each of the user stories in your Trello board and sketch out the screens necessary to deliver the functionality that fulfills the acceptance criteria of that story. You’ll find inevitably that some user stories share common screens. The goal is to get complete coverage so that you wind up with the full set of screens that facilitate all stories.</p>
<p>When your finished you’ll have a set of screens that constitute v1 of your application. Woohoo! That should feel good. You’re looking at the bare minimum set of UX you will need to create in order to deliver your app.</p>
<p><strong>BREA</strong>: Complete <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all the major background scene elements</a> with your majestic mountains. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Sketch out the low-fi wireframe for your application. If you don’t have a whiteboard, do this on a piece of paper (I find a whiteboard for whatever reason yields better flow than sketching on paper for this stage). Don’t erase anything. If you don’t have enough white board real estate to capture it all, move to the next step before you erase any screens. Here are my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16UHauHFmRsJx2fiEL_W3naG3C6C08EaY?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sketches for the v2 Charity Makeover build</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Step 4: Make a clickable mockup from your wireframe and get user feedback</h2>
<p>Hold onto your butt. We’re going to make a quantum leap with a few minutes of work by converting your static whiteboard sketches into an interactive, clickable prototype of your application that you can share online and use to solicit user feedback. And yes, I’m serious this will take you less time than it takes Bob to paint a happy little tree.</p>
<p>Here’s what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Signup for <a href="https://marvelapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marvel App</a> and download their iOS or Android mobile app.</li>
<li>Take photos of each panel representing a screen of your application. Frame the photo so the edges are perfectly aligned with the container of the screen.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts in the application to create a new app and add the photos you just took as the screens ol your application.</li>
<li>Draw hotspots on each interactive element (buttons, lists, anything clickable) and link it to the target screen.</li>
<li>Publish the app and copy the link.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have a link that you can share like <a href="https://marvelapp.com/6694ea4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> that yields a clickable low-fi prototype you can share with anyone. Testers can leave feedback inline while using the application with the comment feature and give you context-specific input about the UX for each screen.</p>
<p><strong>BREA</strong>: Layer in <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=1040" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the midground elements</a> and add some happy little trees. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Use the free Marvel App to convert your whiteboard sketches into a clickable prototype and solicit feedback from at least five prospective users of the application. Now go through each user story Trello card. Can you check off the acceptance criteria in each? Are there any holes where the current prototype fails test coverage? Do not advance to the next step until you have input from at least five people who would be your prospective users and until you can in good conscience check off every single acceptance criteria item. This is the time to validate whether you’re truly building the right thing. It’s easiest to make changes before you move further so take advantage of this time to get the functionality right.</em></p>
<h2>Step 5: Make a high-fidelity clickable mockup</h2>
<p>Ok so you’ve validated that there is A) demand for what you’re building B) it’s got the right set of essential functionality and C) the UX …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>and why you should start scraping the web now</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/11-usages-for-web-scraping-banner.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/11-usages-for-web-scraping-banner.jpg 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/11-usages-for-web-scraping-banner.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Many people ask themselves the question, how do I improve in the areas covered below. In a lot of the cases it's important to know that web scraping plays a major role in it and that it's actually rather easy to get started.</p><p>With web scraping you can extract data from any website and as some may say "Data is the new gold". There is so much important data to be gathered from websites that you can make great business decisions on.</p><p>Below are our 11 usages for web scraping and why you should start scraping now.</p><h2 id="build-your-new-product">Build your new product</h2><p>No Code tools are on a rise. They allow you to create certain flows, analyze data, create stunning websites and more without any knowledge of coding. You don't have to be a technical founder anymore to start a business. But what many people don't know about web scraping is that you can leverage it to use that data as input to your new application. For example, you want to create <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/build-your-first-crypto-app-using-amazon-honeycode/">a mobile application that shows the latest cryptocurrency prices</a>? No problem, it only takes an hour.</p><h2 id="seo">SEO</h2><p>Having organic growth is next to direct traffic, the biggest source of traffic coming to your website. Sadly it's also the hardest one to optimize for. It requires a lot of persistence, monitoring and analyzing to get ranked among the top. Even when you're at the top you still have to optimize for click throughs on your links. Tough business! Luckily this is where web scraping is very powerful. It can help to decrease your workload and automate some tasks for you. For example:</p><ul><li>Help you <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/build-your-first-crypto-app-using-amazon-honeycode/">track the ranking of your website for your specific keywords</a></li><li>Identify and monitor keywords of competitors by getting a daily list</li><li>Analyze the top ranking keywords and alternatives for you</li></ul><p>and a lot more.</p><h2 id="dataset-creation">Dataset creation</h2><p>One of the big tasks of a data scientist, computer vision specialist and others that need data is the creation of a trustworthy and well composed dataset. Web scraping can take any website list and compose it into a usable data stream that you can build on top of. If you have a great tool like <a href="https://scraper.ai/">Scraper.AI</a> you can also <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/how-to-create-a-hourly-updating-covid-19-dataset-under-5-minutes/">monitor that data</a> and keep your dataset up-to-date in the land of fast changing data.</p><h2 id="competitor-tracking">Competitor tracking</h2><p>Knowing the competition is one of the most valuable techniques there is. It helps you to connect to your audience but also makes you stay on top of your sector. Having a web scraper and being to extract the prices of a webshop of your competitor ensures you that you can be the cheapest out there.</p><p>For beginning startups they can for example monitor new comers in their space and see what approach they're taking. It might mean that they've found product market fit.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>Where it all starts, the starts with is replaced with a fancy arrow (➜)</p><ul><li>Starting a business ➜ Discovering an idea</li><li>Getting started with SEO ➜ Discovering keywords</li><li>Knowing your competition ➜ Discovering your competitors</li><li>Investing ➜ Discovering what to invest in</li><li>Buying a property ➜ Discovering a property</li><li>Making money on stocks ➜ Discovering what stocks to buy</li><li>...</li></ul><p>This list can go on for a long while, an action almost always starts with the discovery of something. Discovering means that you want to get the data that justifies the decision you're gonna take to get to that action.</p><p>You might want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6YWbFoaruI">watch stock websites</a> to get to learn about price changes of your favourite stock. </p><p>Web scraping can get these latests stocks, properties, and many more.</p><h2 id="product-monitoring">Product monitoring</h2><p>You're a vendor, dropshipper, amazon seller or anyone that sells a product. A major part will be making sure that you're product fulfills certain demands. You want to watch for reviews, correct pricing, advertising, ... it's a lot of work.</p><p>Scraping reviews ensures that you can sustain you're high rating, act on low ratings and make sure that they get resolved correctly. Watching prices from competitors, analyzing your advertising metrics in one dashboard. They can all be automated with web scraping. In essence you're making your personalized software product.</p><h2 id="marketing-automation">Marketing automation</h2><p>Finding potential influencers becomes a lot easier, you can go to instagram, facebook, quora, ... and get a list of comments or profiles with most views, likes, watches. The only thing you have to do is open up the scraper, select the names and you're ready to go. Most websites don't show emails anymore due to privacy reasons, but you can private message them or use some other tools to get the email for that user.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-26.png 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-26.png 1000w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-26.png 1600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-26.png 2295w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="lead-generation">Lead generation</h2><p>A great way to get interesting prospects for your business is generating leads. As soon as you have leads you can setup a sales pipeline and get these leads converted to customers. </p><h3 id="getting-the-leads">Getting the leads</h3><p>But getting these leads is not always straightforward. You first need to find your audience. Luckily there are already great tools out there like LinkedIn search, yellow pages, google maps, angellist, producthunt, ... They all have one thing in common. They show you a list of leads. Great! Because this means we can extract the data from that list and convert it to something usable for us, an excel file, csv, ... anything we need to get these leads converted and expand our business. </p><h2 id="investment-optimization">Investment optimization</h2><p>As a Venture Capital firm you might be interested in startups that were backed by others VCs, you can just go to their page, spend an hour or so per day and get that list. Or you can scrape and monitor them. You can extract the data every day and get notified when a new startup gets added.</p><p>By also combining this with dataset creation you can go in the history of a startup and minimize the risk you take in investing in a startup.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-25.png" alt=""></figure><h2 id="finance">Finance</h2><p>Stocks, crypto, personal finances and more are something everyone has touched at least once. But it involves a lot of manual labour.</p><p>Cryptocurrency or stock investors might find themselves looking at listing sites hourly to get the latest prices and volumes. Monitoring these could come in handy and web scrapers can get you this information in no time, leaving you with more time to do the analysis. Some services also offer direct API endpoints making it as easy to integrate as possible</p><p>Your personal finances are important, you can scrape them and get notified when a bill comes through, a salary gets deposited and more. Become aware of any event that happens at any time.</p><h2 id="real-estate-monitoring">Real estate monitoring</h2><p>Buying a property can be painful, there are plenty of listing sites, aggregators, agents and more and they all have their own time schedule.

Among the first I say because there are others doing exactly the same! </p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Web scraping is not new and has proven to be valuable. It can automate time-consuming tasks and leave you with more time in hand to focus on the exact problem you're trying to solve. Being from analyzing data to buying a property.

        <p>If you take a closer look, you'll notice that Ruby's grammar has quite a few edge-case where its syntax is inconsistent or ambiguous:</p>



<h2 id="binary-minus-vs-minus-taken-as-unary-method-argument">Binary Minus vs Minus taken as Unary Method Argument</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [1,3,4,5].size - 1

# syntax error, unexpected tINTEGER,
# expecting tASSOC
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ambiguous-if-to-parse--unary-or-as-part-of-binary-match-operator">Ambiguous if to Parse <code>~</code> Unary or as Part of Binary Match Operator</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; $_="Eurucamp X"

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p><em>We at Stratiteq love to explore new technologies and see how they can be applied in real life. Here is a story of one of our recent projects.</em></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Inspiration for this project came from&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasas-dragonfly-will-fly-around-titan-looking-for-origins-signs-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">NASA’s Dragonfly</span></span></a><span><u><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;mission</span></u></span><span><span lang="EN-GB"> that was announced last year&nbsp;and&nbsp;will be launched 2026 with&nbsp;the&nbsp;goal of exploring Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Dragonfly will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;drone-like spacecraft, size-wise like&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mars<s>-</s>rover, and it will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;first vehicle ever that is capable to transfer its entire&nbsp;scientific&nbsp;payload from one place to another&nbsp;on&nbsp;Titan’s&nbsp;surface&nbsp;for&nbsp;material analysis. Dragonfly is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the only&nbsp;mission that will&nbsp;use drone technology. The&nbsp;Perseverance rover that will be launched tomorrow (July 30, 2020) will&nbsp;also&nbsp;carry&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Mars Helicopter</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;with it to Mars&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to test this technology for the first time on&nbsp;another world.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Our project, Dragonfly Mini, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;autonomous vehicle&nbsp;that consist of a rover and a drone.&nbsp;The rover is powered by&nbsp;an&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">NVIDIA Jetson Nano</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">,&nbsp;a&nbsp;small supercomputer that is capable of processing different AI algorithms.&nbsp;The rover can move autonomously,&nbsp;but it can also be controlled&nbsp;remotely.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is equipped with&nbsp;a camera and&nbsp;mobile phone that is used&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;access&nbsp;point&nbsp;to the Internet.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Besides&nbsp;being a communication device, we also made full usage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;mobile phone cameras, sensors and&nbsp;its&nbsp;processing power.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The rover&nbsp;is capable of controlling&nbsp;camera equipped drone, which&nbsp;gives it better overview of the surrounding area.&nbsp;Collected data is processed with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano and data points are uploaded to&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Microsoft’s Azure cloud</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></span><span><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In order to test our rover, we decided to take a trip to Iceland. Besides being able to record in a nice environment, Iceland is over 2000 kilometres away from our home office in Malmö and we consider it to be an impressive enough distance for a test of this project. Tests were done in the southern part of Iceland and we were careful to test it on allowed areas only, since, as you probably know, moss on Iceland is protected and if damaged takes years to grow back. If you are planning a similar experiment, please have that in mind. Feel free to check the video below to see what people who worked on the project said about it.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">There were different challenges in order to&nbsp;execute&nbsp;this project.&nbsp;The first&nbsp;thing we had to figure out is how to move the rover. We equipped&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano with a&nbsp;camera,&nbsp;and we trained it&nbsp;for&nbsp;obstacle&nbsp;detection through deep learning.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Collision avoidance worked well in the office, but in the real world there are unknown obstacles so we decided to use&nbsp;the&nbsp;FCRN (Fully Convolutional Residual Network) model on&nbsp;the&nbsp;iOS phone, which we, as mentioned earlier, added to the rover to be able to have Internet connection.

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">The mobile&nbsp;phone was also used to provide the data from its sensors, so we built an API&nbsp;in Azure cloud where we&nbsp;were&nbsp;sending&nbsp;GPS location, altitude, compass data and other data points.

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">To be able to control&nbsp;the&nbsp;rover manually we created&nbsp;a&nbsp;dashboard and we added&nbsp;manual controls to it.

We decided to&nbsp;train&nbsp;a&nbsp;custom model that is capable to detect puffins and we tested the model on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano with&nbsp;the&nbsp;videos we recorded. We also decided to explore possible usage for search and rescue scenarios, since drones&nbsp;can&nbsp;cover vast areas.</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>It's two days before Jessica will be unable to pay her rent for the first time in her life, and she is standing at the gate of the private charity "Hermandad del Refugio" in downtown Zaragoza. Here in the capital of the Aragon region, between Barcelona and Madrid, the summers are hot and the winters windy. Around 10 a.m. in late May, the sun is already scorching.</p>


<p>There are 18 men and women ahead of Jessica in line, standing silently, their arms folded across their chests. They are all pulling shopping trolleys, into which they'll pack milk cartons, noodles and two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of chicken. Without the free food provided by the Catholic charity, the people in line would have trouble making ends meet.</p>

</figure><p>The coronavirus pandemic brought large parts of the Spanish economy to a standstill. When Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the lockdown on the evening of March 14, shops, restaurants, concert halls and shops all closed down and from one day to the next, public life and the economy ground to a halt. Within six weeks, 760,000 people had lost their jobs -- on top of the more than 3 million people who had already been unemployed at the beginning of the year. Another 3 million were furloughed.</p>

<div>
<h3>More Hungry People</h3><p>Jessica, too, lost her job, though she didn't actually have to be laid off. Jessica is a singer and In March, she was still working with an orchestra. Technically, she was only ever employed for the day of the performance, but she still earned enough money to survive. A portion of the 900 euros ($1,016) she earned a month was paid out in cash.</p><p>She received notice of her termination via WhatsApp and in mid-May, Jessica went to a food bank for the first time. She'd rather not give her last name. "It makes me sad to stand in line here," she says. The charity in downtown Zaragoza is currently providing 2,271 people with free food, and increase of 504 since before the lockdown.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>The same thing has been happening all over Spain. In the cities of Madrid and Barcelona, but also in rural areas, Catholic charities have provided 60 percent more aid than in previous years, says Raúl Flores of the Foessa Foundation, which is investigating the social situation for Caritas.</p><p>The lines of hungry people are growing longer and longer and they are the most visible sign of what the country can likely expect in the coming months: the worst economic crisis since the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939. According to worst-case estimates by the Bank of Spain, the economy could shrink by up to 14 percent and unemployment could rise to 21 percent, which would push the country's sovereign debt load to 130 percent of the country's gross domestic product.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>A New Social Law Is Born</h3><p>The coronavirus crisis has accelerated the debate in Spain over the introduction of a basic income, since state-funded social aid does not yet exist. It wasn't until the death of the dictator Franco in 1975 that a welfare state developed here, though it was rather week. Families with children receive hardly any support.</p><p>The introduction of a basic income was therefore the main election promise of the leftist Podemos party and they made the program part of their coalition agreement with the Socialists last fall. Now the Sánchez government is rushing to get the project off the ground to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from plunging into the abyss.</p><p>"It is a historic moment for our democracy," said Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, "the birth of a new social law."</p><p>Spain, after all, still hasn't fully recovered from the consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2008. Even before the outbreak of the virus, the poverty rate hovered around 20 percent and the labor market is divided, with too few people enjoying permanent contracts with unemployment benefits, and too many having to make do with temporary contracts that often only last for a few days. According to statistics from the Spanish employment agency SEPE, 8.4 million people are now looking for a job.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>The Only Way to Survive</h3><p>Thus far, only regional governments have allocated aid money -- paltry sums that reached only 75,000 people, or barely a third of all the poor, according to social researcher Flores. Basic income would provide financial security for the most vulnerable 850,000 households.</p><p>But an "ingreso mínimo vital," literally a "minimum income to live," comes with strings attached. The program would only apply to people between the ages of 23 and 65 and they must have been registered as living in Spain for at least one year without interruption. They must also be actively looking for a steady job, be involved in a continuing education program or, in cases of drug dependency, be enrolled in a therapy program. The social welfare office would look into applicants' assets and existing income and that would be topped up to a level of 462 euros per month for singles and up to 1,015 euros per month for a family of five.</p>

<p>For 2.3 million Spaniards, a basic income is likely the only way to get through the corona crisis. Nowhere is this more evident than in Madrid, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic. The capital is one of the richest regions in the country, yet there are plenty of needy people, such as in the tangled side streets from behind the Puerta del Sol to the Plaza de Jacinto Benavente.</p><p>The Ave Maria food bank, run by the city, mostly takes care of the homeless, but since March, geriatric nurses, waitresses and salespeople have also been showing up. All of them have lost their jobs. The crisis first hit those who worked illegally or only had short-term contracts, often foreign workers who had found a precarious job during the recent economic upswing. They were among the first to be laid off.</p><h3>A Real Boost</h3><p>One of them is Mario Ignat. The 30-year-old came to Spain from Romania eight years ago and has been working in construction ever since. But there's no more work to be had. In Madrid alone, 138,000 people have lost their jobs and half a million have been furloughed, a consequence of around 1,000 companies going bankrupt each week during the lockdown.</p><p>Ignat hasn't yet lived in Spain for 10 years, so he doesn't have Spanish citizenship. He earns barely enough to pay rent and there is nothing left over for going out with friends, having a beer in the bar next door or even cooking for himself. The new basic income could significantly improve his life.</p><p>For Mario Ignat and Jessica, a lot depends on when the money will actually be paid out. They can apply for the basic income starting on June 15 and before the end of the month, the first 100,000 eligible applicants will receive aid retroactively going back to June 1. That, at least, is what the government has promised. Jessica hopes that she won't end up on the street before then.</p><p><em>With reporting by Oliver Imhof in Madrid</em></p>

<p>I’m co-admin of a little page on Facebook that caters to a niche audience of AFL statistics nerds known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uselessaflstats" target="blank">Useless AFL Stats</a>, where (founder and co-admin) Aaron and I discover stats that have no relevance to anything at all, and will never be useful to anyone, ever. And that got me thinking, why should I have all the fun finding these nuggets of gold?</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer in open source programming and data, the idea that as much data should be made publicly available as possible to the largest possible audience. After all, 1000 plus brains are going to be more innovative, better at analysing trends, faster at fact checking (and creating useless AFL stats) than just 2.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ll be taking you on a journey from beginner to expert, to give you the tools to be the master of your own AFL data analysis. Key points will be covered in this first post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup of your coding workspace
<ul>
<li>R installation</li>
<li>Rstudio installation and setup</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Basics of R</li>
<li>Downloading AFL data</li>
<li>Creating your first useless AFL stat</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions during this tutorial, you can tweet at me <a href="https://twitter.com/crow_data_sci" target="blank">@crow_data_sci</a>. If you’ve got a useless stat, feel free to tweet at us <a href="https://twitter.com/UselessStatsAFL" target="blank">@UselessStatsAFL</a> or message the page.</p>
<p>Ok, let get into the setup!</p>
<div id="r-and-rstudio-installation">

<p>The program that we’ll be using to generate stats is <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="blank">R</a>, a powerful tool commonly used by professional statisticians and data scientists in academia and industry, but we’ll be using it to shitpost about AFL stats.</p>
<p>We’ll be downloading R from here <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/" target="blank">https://cloud.r-project.org/</a> and choose the version for your OS. I’d recommend all the default file locations and setup. If you are using a MAC OS, click <code>R-4.0.x.pkg</code> which is the executable.</p>
<p>We’ll also be using RStudio, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows for easier use of the R language. Download the free version here at <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="blank">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>.</p>
<p>Once they’ve been downloaded, open up your newly installed RStudio program. It should automatically find R and open up an interface. Think of R as the frame, steering wheel and engine of a car. You can get pretty far with just that, but RStudio completes the car, adding all the bells and whistles for a more comfortable journey. God that’s a terrible analogy.</p>
<div id="basics-of-r">
<h2>Basics of R</h2>
<p>Anyway, you should see a screen and tab named ‘Console’. This is where all the the commands get executed, lets try a couple out.</p>
<pre><code>1+1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>2*4</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<pre><code>3^3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 27</code></pre>
<p>Nice, what you’ll see is that the answer has been calculated and result has been produced on the next line.</p>
<p>Let’s save these results, we may want to use them later. In R we use an assignment command <code>&lt;-</code>, which looks like a backwards arrow. You can assign a result to any string of characters. You can also assign characters (like names, teams, locations, etc) to variables too.</p>
<pre><code>a &lt;- 1+1
b &lt;- 2*4
c &lt;- 3^3
first_name &lt;- 'John'</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the ‘Environment’ tab in the top right section, we can see our newly created variables, which we can use later on. Variables can be used in commands with each other too. You can’t add strings to numbers though.</p>
<pre><code>a + b * c</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 218</code></pre>
<p>Another important concept are vectors, a data structure that can hold multiple values. We use <code>c()</code> to denote a vector and we can insert multiple values.</p>
<pre><code>d &lt;- c(3,7,8,2)
teams &lt;- c('WCE','Freo','Geel')
d</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3 7 8 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>d*2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  6 14 16  4</code></pre>
<pre><code>d[3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<pre><code>teams[2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] "Freo"</code></pre>
<p>We can multiply and add to vectors and use square brackets to pull out certain indexes (positions) of the vector. Press the up arrow to cycle backwards through your previous commands.</p>
</div>
<div id="projects">
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Projects help contain all of your data and files in an easy to maintain structure. We’ll create one for all of our AFL data analysis.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the dropdown menu in the top right corner</li>
<li>New project (and save)</li>
<li>New Directory</li>
<li>New Project</li>
<li>Name it (<code>AFL_Scripts</code> or something similar)</li>
</ol>
<p>This initialises your new project, and we’ll do all our analysis in this project. Use the command <code>getwd()</code> to find out the file path of this directory. You should see something similar to <code>C:/Users/your_name/Documents/AFL_Scripts</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="scripts">
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>Scripts are an easy way to store commands that you want to come back to later, and all of our data analysis will be written in scripts. To create a new script:</p>
<ol>
<li>File (top left)</li>
<li>New File</li>
<li>R Script</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing commands in the script and pressing enter will not execute the command, but will take you to a newline. To execute a line, use <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Enter</code>. Press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>S</code>to save your script, and you should see it appear in the ‘Files’ tab on the left hand side.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lets-get-into-some-afl-analytics">

<p>In our new script, we first need to install some packages and load them into our workspace by executing the following commands.</p>
<div id="installing-packages">
<h2>Installing packages</h2>
<pre><code>install.packages("devtools") #allows us to download from github
install.packages("dplyr")    #data manipulation tools
install.packages("tidyr")    #more data manipulation tools
install.packages("snakecase")#data cleaning tool
install.packages("hms")      #date formatting
devtools::install_github("jimmyday12/fitzRoy") #package that loads afltables into R</code></pre>
<p>Ingore the warning about “Rtools”, it’s a windows development tool that we won’t be using.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-packages">
<h2>Loading packages</h2>
<pre><code>library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(snakecase)
library(fitzRoy)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s another analogy, think of <code>install.packages</code> as a light bulb and <code>library</code> as a switch. You only need to install a package once (unless you update R), and can use the <code>library</code> function to turn them on when needed.</p>
<p>Side note using a hash (<code>#</code>) is a programming technique called commenting. Anything after a <code>#</code> will not be run and it allows the programmer to add notes, like what a certain line or function does.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="loading-in-afl-data">

<p>Now that we have everything set up, we can dive right in to the stats. We are going to load in data from <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html" target="blank">afltables.com</a> using <a href="https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy" target="blank">fitzRoy</a>, an R package put together by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesday87" target="blank">James Day</a> that contains most of the match data in a consistent structure.</p>
<p>Lets load in all the data from the year 2000 onwards and assign it to a variable.</p>
<pre><code>afltables &lt;- get_afltables_stats(start_date = '2000-01-01')</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Returning data from 2000-01-01 to 2020-07-28</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Downloading data</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Finished downloading data. Processing XMLs</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Finished getting afltables data</code></pre>
<pre><code># afltables &lt;- get_afltables_stats() will pull in all the data from 1897</code></pre>
<p>Now that the data is loaded into our workspace, you can see in the ‘Environment’ tab that we have 172 thousand rows (observations) and 59 columns (variables). We can confirm this with the <code>dim</code> (short for dimensions) function. Loading in the data from 1897 will have over 600k rows.</p>
<pre><code>dim(afltables) #rows by columns</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 174284     59</code></pre>
<p>Lets use the head command, which shows the top 6 or so rows of our dataset.</p>
<pre><code>head(afltables)</code></pre>

  <hr id="top">

  <p>This is a fun blog post to write for two big reasons.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Thanks to Google Fonts (especially <a href="https://twitter.com/davelab6">Dave Crossland</a>) all of our typefaces have been liberated! What does that mean? Each one is now open source and free for all, forever.</li>
  <li>We made a new website to accommodate this big change, and it is more robust than before with better type preview tools</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting our work on to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is still a work in progress, but the typefaces (including variable versions) will make it there eventually. In the meantime, they are available on <a href="https://github.com/etcetera-type-co">Github</a> and each font page on our site is showing the latest version in webfont (woff2) form.</p>
<p>We haven't blogged in over a year but during that quiet time we deleted our social media profiles. However, several thousand of you have signed up for our newsletter, which is how we're going to spread the word about these huge updates. We'll blast the news out soon. It feels good to relaunch the website with no store functionality necessary. We're free. The fonts are free.</p>
<p>All of our work has been improved dramatically since we initially published them. Each typeface now meets the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets">Google Fonts Plus glyph set</a> requirements, and each one has received many aesthetic upgrades as well. We could post a bunch of images here but how about some big links to the respective font pages, yeah?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Konsole is having a resurge in the moment, it’s the terminal emulator of choice
for the power user that wants to break the 4th wall in *nix systems. Right now
it can do almost all the things I want it to do, and a few more.</p>

<p>Since last year you can use splits in Konsole, with full drag &amp; drop support
between tabs and windows.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9Y1pul8smQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>You can also use Konsole to quickly check for thumbnails of anything that dolphin
can show you, just by hovering with the mouse (and depending of your configuration)
pressing shift/control/alt. To my knowledge Konsole is the only terminal emulator
that supports this.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lic9xKG4lo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Probably you already used <code>ls</code> to list a file that you need to get the full url,
to open in an unrelated program that does not accept the common way to open files
via the shell, and you need to paste into a dialog, or you just need to send the
full path of a file for a project colleague. I had problems with this untill I
snapped and implemented a way for konsole to <code>Copy Location</code>, it copies the full
file path of the selected file, and adds this data to your clipboard.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z11WRTM35Nc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Konsole supported for quite a while a way for you to click in a file and open it
in a the default editor (you need to have this configured in the profile) - but
sometimes we don’t want to open it in the default file, we wan’t to visualize
a image in gwenview or edit it in gimp, so now konsole supports a <code>Open With</code> menu
quite helpful when you don’t remember the name of the app you want to use but
remember the icon. :)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUhftcLEfXo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Now a few features I’m working that I expect that will be ready for the next
version of konsole, those are still in review and I don’t know when they will
be ready, it’s just a sneak peek:</p>

<p>Configurable dimm stength for inactive terminals - when you are working with
split views and many terminals, there’s a option in the profile that makes the
terminals without focus darker, so it’s easier to know which terminal you are,
but it was not possible to configure the amount of darkening - and different
people have different needs, so now you can do this: (<em>not merged yet</em>)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dx8B6mJqVhU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Improved broadcast support - Konsole already supported this, but it did not play
well with splits, and it was not really easy to integrate multiple windows. How
you can now select what kind of broadcast group a terminal belongs to, any
terminal that belongs to the same group will send data to it, there’s also a
None group - for terminals that should not send data anywhere, and a <code>Broadcast
to All</code> groups, that will push data everywhere - despite being in the group or
not. (<em>not merged yet</em>)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmI-t-nGsKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Support for URL Escape Codes. There’s a spec that specifies how a terminal
application can embbed a URL inside of a block of text, by using the special
notation: <code>\e]8;;http://www.kde.org\e\\click here\e]8;;\e\\\n</code> this is equivalent
to the html code <code>&lt;a href="http://www.kde.org&gt; click here &lt;/a&gt;</code> and there’s a
work in progress implementation for that in the works (featuring a VIP list of
accepted schemas, currently only file, http and https are allowed, but the user
can overrite)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_caJmf142Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Those are all of the features that I worked (minus <em>tons</em> of bugfixes, security
improvements and general rewrites that are unrelated to new features). I hope
you all enjoy the new konsole, that is still one of the fastest terminal
emulators around, even tough it’s packed with features for the experienced and
novice user.</p>

July 30, 2020 | https://pace.dev/blog/2020/07/27/how-code-generation-wrote-our-api-and-cli.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pace.dev/blog/2020/07/27/how-code-generation-wrote-our-api-and-cli.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div uk-lightbox="toggle:.lightbox-toggle">
<p>We recently released the <a href="https://pace.dev/docs" rel="nofollow">Pace API</a>, along with an accompanying <a href="https://pace.dev/docs/cli" rel="nofollow">command line tool</a>, and various client libraries, all of which enable programmatic integration with Pace.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto" rel="nofollow">Oto</a> to describe our RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API using Go interfaces and structs, and a variety of templates to generate the code we need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All methods in the API use a input and output struct for the request and response, supporting all JSON data types; strings, numbers, bools, objects and arrays.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="describing-the-api-1">Describing the API</h3>
<p>We describe our API using Go interfaces and structs.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample from our <code>CardsService</code> that describes the <code>GetCard</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>package pace

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(GetCardRequest) GetCardResponse
}

// GetCardRequest is the input object for GetCard.
type GetCardRequest struct {
	// OrgID is the ID of the org.
	// example: "your-org-id"
	OrgID string
	// CardID is the ID of the card to get.
	// example: "123"
	CardID string
}

// GetCardResponse is the output object for GetCard.
type GetCardResponse struct {
	// Card is the card.
	Card Card
}

type Card struct {
	ID           string
	CTime        string
	Title        string
	Body         string
	BodyHTML     string
	// simplified to save your eyes
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is real Go code, our IDEs build and lint this along with the rest of our code.</p>
<h3 id="how-oto-parses-the-definition-2">How Oto parses the definition</h3>
<p>Oto uses the <code>golang.org/x/tools/go/packages</code> package (among others from the standard library) to understand the Go code, and turn the definition files into a workable data structure.</p>
<p>The following types are taken from the <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/parser.go" rel="nofollow">parser inside Oto</a>:</p>
<pre><code>// Service describes a service, akin to an interface in Go.
type Service struct {
	Name    string   `json:"name"`
	Methods []Method `json:"methods"`
	Comment string   `json:"comment"`
}

// Method describes a method that a Service can perform.
type Method struct {
	Name           string    `json:"name"`
	NameLowerCamel string    `json:"nameLowerCamel"`
	InputObject    FieldType `json:"inputObject"`
	OutputObject   FieldType `json:"outputObject"`
	Comment        string    `json:"comment"`
}

// etc
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have Go data that describes the interfaces, methods and structs, we can use templates to generate code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oto uses <a href="https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush" rel="nofollow">Plush templates from the Buffalo project</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation-3">Code generation</h3>
<p>Oto is essentially a code generation tool, because most of the work needed to wire up an implementation to an endpoint is predictable boilerplate that we would prefer not to write.</p>
<p>When generics lands in Go, we will be able to reduce the amount of boilerplate code generated in favour of generic methods. In this world, we may not need to generate much plumbing code at all.</p>
<h4 id="generating-server-side-plumbing-4">Generating server-side plumbing</h4>
<p>The first thing we generate is the server-side plumbing for the implementation of the service.</p>
<ul>
<li>The template that was used to generate this code is <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/otohttp/templates/server.go.plush" rel="nofollow">available as part of <code>otohttp</code></a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>package api

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(context.Context, GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error)
}

type cardsServiceServer struct {
	server       *otohttp.Server
	cardsService CardsService
}

// RegisterCardsService registers the CardsService implementation with the otohttp Server.
func RegisterCardsService(server *otohttp.Server, cardsService CardsService) {
	handler := &amp;cardsServiceServer{
		server:       server,
		cardsService: cardsService,
	}
	server.Register("CardsService", "GetCard", handler.handleCardsServiceGetCard)
}

func (s *cardsServiceServer) handleCardsServiceGetCard(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var request GetCardRequest
	if err := otohttp.Decode(r, &amp;request); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	response, err := s.cardsService.GetCard(r.Context(), request)
	if err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	if err := otohttp.Encode(w, r, http.StatusOK, response); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, we generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>CardsService</code> Go interface that describes the methods of the service. Notice that <code>context.Context</code> and <code>error</code> types were added to the signature of the methods</li>
<li>The <code>cardsServiceServer</code> struct couples the <code>otohttp.Server</code> with the service implementation, and has real <code>http.Handler</code> methods like <code>handleCardsServiceGetCard</code> that handles the RPC calls</li>
<li>The <code>RegisterCardsService</code> method uses the <code>Register</code> method on the <code>otohttp.Server</code> to bind the route <code>CardsService.GetCard</code> to the appropriate handler</li>
</ul>
<p>All we have to do is write a struct that implements the new <code>CardsService</code> interface, and the generated code, along with the code inside <code>otohttp</code>, does the rest for us.</p>
<h4 id="generating-clients-5">Generating clients</h4>
<p>A client is used to access the services on the remote server.</p>
<p>They aren’t always necessary if you’re working with plain-old JSON/HTTP but due to the security measures in Pace, we need to securely sign each request with a secret cryptographic key so we can be sure it is being made by a trusted partner. This can be tricky, so we generate clients that do it for you.</p>
<p>The first client we generate is a Go package, which we use in our tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By <strong>dog-fooding</strong> the generated Go client in our tests, we can not only ensure the services are functioning as we expect them to, but also that the client itself works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The generated code for the <code>GetCard</code> client (generated from a <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/pace/blob/master/oto/client.go.plush" rel="nofollow">template file in the <code>github.com/pacedotdev/pace</code> project</a>) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// GetCard gets a card.
func (s *CardsService) GetCard(ctx context.Context, r GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error) {
	requestBodyBytes, err := json.Marshal(r)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: marshal GetCardRequest")
	}
	signature, err := generateSignature(requestBodyBytes, s.client.secret)
	if err != nil {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/53bde489c28f22db0ca85d16d348e36b6af44214/7bc7c/images/everyday-design.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>There’s a secret code embedded in every app, website, and interface you use. Underneath your fingers is a hidden world traveled by the interface designers, caught up in a war between the complexities of technology and the breakneck evolution of user needs. These designers speak cryptically in neologisms (squircle, sharrow, neumorphism) and food-themed shibboleths (hamburger menu or meatball menu? Candy bar or toast?).</p>
<p>Their code is made of things called affordances. Those fluent in the language of affordances possess an intuitive and powerful understanding of how design works.</p>
<p>So let’s take a trip into the depths of interface design and shine a light on affordances. We’ll study them, explore how they work, and see how they define our digital tools. Bringing affordances out of the shadows can lead to clearer conversations about design, no matter if you’re a veteran designer or a casual user.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-affordances">The history of affordances</h2>
<p>In 1988, Don Norman published a book called <em>The Design of Everyday Things.</em> At the time, Norman was transitioning from a career in cognitive science and psychology to one in technology&nbsp;— he was one of the first people to write about “human-centered design,” an approach to technology that focuses on human biology and psychology to create functional software and hardware. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> was the genesis of many of these ideas, including one he called “affordances.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norman’s explorations of usability design, human-centered-design, and universal design all serve as the foundation of modern digital product design. But it’s the concept of affordances that has taken on a life all its own. Designers have taken the original definition and transformed it slightly: today, designers use “affordances” to mean “properties of objects which show users the actions they can take.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Here’s an example of an affordance in the real world:</p>
<p>A handle on a door is an affordance: it indicates that the door should be pulled. A flat, rectangular plate on a door is an affordance indicating that it should be pushed.</p>
<p>Norman would say that a handle or a plate is a <em>good affordance</em>, because of its relationship to the person who is using the door. A plate on a door begs to be pushed. Without edges or round parts to grab, the natural way&nbsp;— the only way&nbsp;— of interacting with it is to push. A good door handle, on the other hand, is located right where your arm naturally falls when reaching for the door. The radius of the handle is the right size to give you a good grip. It’s located on the side of the door opposite the hinge, so the door isn’t too hard to open.</p>
<p>Some doors don’t have good affordances. To make up for the confusion, there’s a “PUSH” or “PULL” sign. The sign doesn’t take advantage of the way our bodies instinctively interact with the door; it’s only helpful to people with good vision, who happen to be paying attention, or aren’t in too much of a hurry.</p>
<p>So, a good affordance takes advantage of some natural interaction between a thing and its user. Something that’s supposed to be used with your hands ought to be hand-shaped (and ambidextrous!). If something has visual feedback mechanisms, those mechanisms should be at eye level. Things arranged in physical space&nbsp;— like a row of lights, or a set of stovetop burners&nbsp;— should have their controls arranged in a corresponding way.</p>
<p>But we don’t always have a physical relationship to the tools we use.</p>
<p>Our phones, laptops, tablets, watches, and earbuds have so many functions that many interactions are digital by default. What does a good affordance look like in the digital world? If good affordances are ones that suit the nature of the interaction, what happens when the interactions are finger (or mouse pointer) on a flat, glass surface?</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-affordances">The evolution of affordances</h2>
<p>Designers of early computers had to figure out what good digital affordances looked like. Most built clues into interfaces based on familiar physical objects: things stored in your computer’s memory are called files, and files are grouped into folders. How do you use a real-world folder? You open it. So, we can easily find the right command for accessing our digital folders because it’s labeled “open.” These affordances have been around for more than 70 years.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Some designers had to reckon with entirely new functions, ones that didn’t have any real-world equivalent. For instance, how do you represent a hyperlink&nbsp;— a piece of text that fluidly joins two documents together? Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, had to figure it out. He chose a blue underline. But there’s no reason why blue means “link”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the first WWW client&nbsp;… used just underline to represent [a] link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn’t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color&nbsp;— I don’t remember which was the first to use blue.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early days of the web, hundreds of affordances were coined this way. The URL for a page goes at the top. Text appears in a vertically scrolling column. A dropdown menu has a downward-pointing triangle next to it. Your mouse cursor is a slanted triangle with a tail, and when you hover over a link it looks like Mickey Mouse’s glove.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of these affordances don’t have any relationship to the physical characteristics of the interaction they mediate. But remove them from a website, application, or interface, and users get disoriented, frustrated, and unproductive.</p>
<p>This is a second way of thinking about good affordances: instead of being useful because they are natural, some affordances are useful because they’re norms. Designers employ commonly recognized icons, patterns, labels, and layouts to make it easy for new users to find and utilize functionality. As Jakob Nielsen puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Design for patterns for which users are accustomed.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This circular definition underscores how important it is for digital interface designers to understand affordances. In fact, how a designer sees, uses, understands, and breaks the rules of affordances is a telling sign of their experience and abilities.</p>
<h2 id="how-designers-use-affordances">How designers use affordances</h2>
<p>Early in a designer’s career, they’ll <strong>use affordances</strong> even without knowing. That’s how I got started in design: I copied other designer’s work as a starting point, instead of starting from scratch. I had no idea why certain elements worked the way they did&nbsp;— but by emulating more experienced designers, I could take a shortcut past my lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>But design enough of the same kind of thing&nbsp;— t-shirts, band posters, MySpace pages&nbsp;— and you’ll start to recognize common elements. <strong>Recognizing affordances</strong> might not come with a detailed understanding of the <em>why</em>, but at least many inexperienced designers can identify the <em>what</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding affordances</strong> comes from a place of curiosity. This means questioning affordances&nbsp;— why are links blue? Why is most text left-aligned? Why are user avatars usually cropped into circles? Sometimes the answers to these questions are rooted in psychology, biology, anthropology, or technology.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>But affordances sometimes exist for no obvious reason. As I use the same affordances over and over, I think, “is this really the right way to do things?” As the internet enters its fourth or fifth decade,<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> many designers are <strong>abandoning affordances</strong> once taken for granted. Google, for example, is in the middle of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-kill-url-first-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a battle to kill the URL</a>, one of the few remaining affordances that distinguish a web page from an app.</p>
<p>Finally, as old affordances are being left behind, designers are <strong>inventing new affordances</strong> to take their place. Small touchscreens have become the dominant mode of interaction with digital interfaces,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> and designers created new ways of indicating functionality. The “hamburger” menu is one example: three horizontal lines indicates where to tap to expand a menu, something only required on small screens where some elements have to be hidden.</p>
<figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/722ac6cacbdd4e5bfdc4f43a6db10fb634bb846b/9cfa1/images/everyday-design-1.jpg" alt="A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu"><figcaption>A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="affordances-everywhere">Affordances everywhere</h2>
<p>Understanding the correct application of affordances is one of the most fundamental jobs of designers of functional things. This won’t change anytime soon: as long as we’re interacting with the world around us, designers will need to maintain a mental library of affordances.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Affordances are the hidden language of interface design. Using affordances wrong can stunt a company’s growth, as Snapchat famously discovered.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> Using them right has returns in <a href="https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions</a>, <a href="https://articles.uie.com/beyond_ux_tipping_point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intranet-usability-the-trillion-dollar-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillions</a> of dollars.</p>
<p>For that reason, affordances are, and will always be, the things of everyday design.</p>

Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor.

July 29, 2020 | https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Today we published a new version of KeePassRPC (1.12.1) which resolves critical security vulnerabilities in all previous versions of the plugin.</p>
<p><strong>To ensure that your passwords stored within KeePass Password Safe remain secret, you must <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">install this new version</a> immediately.</strong></p>
<p>This does not affect Kee browser extension users that store passwords only in <a href="https://keevault.pm/">Kee Vault</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a vulnerability in the Kee browser extension so re-installing, updating, downgrading, disabling or removing Kee will not affect your exposure to this risk.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you are affected, simply follow the instructions for <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">updating KeePassRPC</a>. If you find an old version of <em>KeePassRPC.plgx</em> on your computer, you should replace it with the newest version immediately.</p>
<p>Download version 1.12.1 or newer from GitHub and install it right now. If you’re unsure how to install a new version of a KeePass plugin, we have documentation to help you at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrading KeePassRPC</a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Additional information about the update</summary>
<p>Version 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 both contain the fixes for these vulnerabilities. If you’re one of the few people who have installed version 1.12.0, you only have to upgrade to 1.12.1 if you want to connect the KeeBird Thunderbird email client extension to KeePassRPC. Unless you already have version 1.12.0 installed, please <strong>install version 1.12.1</strong>.</p>
<p>If for some reason you are unable to update to the new version, some mitigating actions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lock your KeePass databases and do not unlock them until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Close all web browsers and do not browse the internet until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Change the websocket <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/keepassrpc-port/2360">port that KeePassRPC listens on</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3rd suggestion relies on security through obscurity and is thus unlikely to greatly reduce your risk for very long. Obviously all 3 of the above suggestions are very significantly worse than simply updating the plugin straight away.</p>
</details>
<h3>About the vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Credit for discovering and responsibly disclosing the two related vulnerabilities goes to Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik for helping explore the vulnerabilities as well as co-developing and hosting the proof of concept exploits.</p>
<p>Successfully exploiting either vulnerability results in an attacker gaining access to all passwords in any open KeePass databases. No obvious user interaction is required, only a visit to a malicious web site; in some cases there is no visible evidence that the vulnerability is being exploited.</p>
<details>
<summary>
'ALL' passwords may not strictly be true for every user. Expand this section to learn about the subtle potentially mitigating details</summary>
<p>KeePassRPC offers an occasionally-used feature called “Kee home group”. For each open database in KeePass, KeePassRPC will only reveal passwords if they are contained within this group.</p>
<p>Additionally, individual password entries can be hidden from KeePassRPC.</p>
<p>For most people the entire database of entries was at risk of exposure but for those that utilise either of these two features, that action may have limited the set of entries that were at risk of exposure.</p>
<p>Even if you used these features to manage your entries, an additional factor may still have allowed <em>all</em> entries to be exposed. As explained in the KeePassRPC user interface and existing documentation, enabling the KeePass placeholders feature is a security risk in its own right. If you had any entries visible to KeePassRPC which had the placeholder feature enabled, it is feasible that an attacker could have used this to access all entries.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that KeePassRPC only ever sees entries which have a URL field set so if that field is empty, the contents of the entry can only have been at risk if you also utilised the placeholders feature.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> An initial version of this announcement stated that remote code execution would be possible via placeholders. Deeper investigation has confirmed that this was not possible. Apologies for the additional alarm but I felt it was better to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>We consider this to be the most serious category of security vulnerability and implore you to take immediate action - KeePass does not have an automatic update feature so <strong>you must apply the fix yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities were not previously publicly known so <strong>if you take prompt action, it is extremely unlikely that your passwords have been exposed</strong>. However, it is not possible to determine with 100% certainty that you were not targeted by a malicious attacker so you may wish to change your passwords, at least somewhat sooner than you otherwise would have done. For what it’s worth, I will personally be undertaking a password change procedure on all passwords that can feasibly be used to access systems that affect the integrity or security of KeePassRPC, the Kee browser extension, Kee Vault and all related services. Otherwise, I think that the risk is low enough that I will not be accelerating my usual 5-20 year change cycle for any other passwords.</p>
<p>Your master password is never exposed through KeePassRPC and the security of your kdbx file remains intact. It is the individual entries within your KeePass database that were at risk.</p>
<p>Kee 3.5 contains many improvements relating to password saving so if you choose to change any of your website passwords, you may wish to do so using the <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/beta-testing-the-kee-browser-extension/2022">latest beta version</a>. We’ll be requesting that this version of Kee is released to all Kee users very soon but it can take many weeks for the web browser developers to approve a new release.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities outlined below reside in the SRP authentication implementation; successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the usual password-based authentication procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>A piece of information supplied by a KeePassRPC client was not correctly validated before being relied upon in the SRP algorithm.</li>
<li>The use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator in a cryptographically sensitive calculation vastly increased the chance of an attacker being able to guess their way past the usual protection that SRP offers. On some systems a successful exploitation could go unnoticed and complete in less than one minute, although in many cases it would take longer and result in noticeably “strange” behaviour that could alert a user to the threat before it succeeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both vulnerabilities have now been addressed and I have additionally developed a further security layer to reduce the chance that future vulnerabilities in the SRP server could be exploited by malicious websites. In case this additional security layer poses a problem for any consumers of KeePassRPC that are not modern browser extensions, the information I’ve posted in <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/configuring-keepassrpc-1-12-permitted-websocket-origins/3041">this new documentation topic</a> will allow you to work around the new limitation.</p>
<h3>What you can do to help</h3>
<p>No single person or organisation can release perfectly secure code so it is great to see the wider security community probing our Open Source software for vulnerabilities like this.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the experience to help too? As well as reviewing the source code and seeking out vulnerabilities, you may be able to help to reduce the attack surface of KeePassRPC by developing a modern replacement for the HTTP-based communications protocol (websockets) that allowed these vulnerabilities to be exposed to remote systems. We may not be able to make this change without breaking backwards compatibility and it may limit the usefulness of KeePassRPC outside of the context of a browser extension but these drawbacks may be a price worth paying in order to reduce the risk of a similar vulnerability being exploited in future. I’m undecided if it is something we should actively pursue and don’t currently have the resources to implement it alone. Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/issues/23">relevant GitHub issue</a> if you are interested in helping out.</p>
<p>If none of the above sounds like it’s your thing please check out other ways you could help at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/contributions-bugs-help-and-support-guidelines/548">Contributions, bugs, help and support guidelines</a> .</p>
<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p>My priority for the past 24 hours has been ensuring a fast and thorough response to the discovery of this vulnerable SRP server implementation. As such, I can’t yet be very definitive regarding how or why these implementation mistakes were made. It appears as though they can be traced back to code that I wrote around a decade ago when so many factors were different to today. At a later date I will perform a more in-depth analysis of the likely causes - my initial thoughts lead me to think that some significant factors will have been the lack of available battle-tested .NET implementations of big integers and SRP6a.</p>
<p>Distributing critical security updates for a KeePass plugin has never been easy but I hope that this announcement, the use of the optional update notification feature within KeePass and the upcoming version 3.5 of the Kee browser extension - which will refuse to work with any earlier version of KeePassRPC - will all go some way towards accelerating the uptake of this important software update. Please point your co-workers, friends and acquaintances to this forum topic if you think they may also need to install this update.</p>
<p>In case it needs explicitly stating, I can confirm that I am personally very sorry that these vulnerabilities were introduced into KeePassRPC and remained present for so long. I am therefore very grateful to the security researchers (Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik) who discovered the vulnerabilities and so professionally and clearly conveyed their findings to me.</p>
<p>I will prevent replies being added to this topic because posts in this category are often pushed to the community by email but please do post a new topic on this forum if you have any questions - I can’t promise a personal reply but I’ll try my best and hopefully other members of the community can help out when I’m not available.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve already done it but just in case: <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrade KeePassRPC.plgx</a> now!</p>

<p><span>T</span>he day Kim Hye-min threw up on the job while working as a graphic designer at a small broadcasting firm in Seoul, she was so overwhelmed by stress that it made her sick to her stomach. When a senior co-worker shamed her for being just a few minutes late, it echoed what she had heard from older South Koreans all her life: she wasn’t good enough. At lunchtime, she made a run for the restroom stall.</p>



<p>“The criticisms kept building up,” she says, until she reached the point where she didn’t think she could take it anymore. For 26-year-old Hye-min, as for many young South Koreans, life choices feel forced and fixed — and not like actual choices at all. Many feel so beaten down by the rigid social and professional demands of their country that they refer to it as “Hell Joseon,” a play on Korea’s old dynastic name. The path is especially bleak for young women, who must contend with the nation’s deeply rooted misogyny. Deviation from the mainstream is widely viewed as disobedient, and sometimes, in the eyes of older generations, even unpatriotic.</p>



<p>“It’s something to do with Korean society,” Hye-min says. “There’s only one way to engage in relationships with others, or one type of person who’s considered acceptable. And for people like me, it’s really hard.”</p>



<p>Again and again, her parents would ask her,<em> “</em>Hye-min, why can’t you be like your classmates and study hard and do well? Hye-min, why can’t you be like your peers and hurry to finish university and get a job?”</p>



<p>Hye-min never understood why she should have to rush through a school system that did nothing but judge and rank her, only to find a lifelong position at a company that would do the same. She dropped out of university for a year before transferring, sought out counseling for her battered self-esteem, and quit her job, despite knowing that all of these choices would be looked upon as failures. Perhaps toughest of all, Hye-min knew that, even if she were to achieve “success,” it was unlikely she’d be compensated fairly for it: <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/gender-wage-gap/indicator/english_7cee77aa-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea’s gender wage gap</a> is the worst in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with men earning on average 32.5% more than women.</p>



<p>Her parents would ask, “Hye-min, why can’t you be like other women your age and find a nice man and get married?”</p>



<p>Hye-min, however, has no plans to get married. Nor does she expect to have children. After years of being told she must strive to be a good student, good employee, good wife, and good mother, she eventually decided she no longer wanted to partake in a system that ties her social currency and self-worth to such a punishing status quo. So Hye-min opted out. “Why do I have to continue on, going through these difficulties?” she says. “For what?”</p>

<p><strong>In traditionally collectivist</strong> South Korea, individualist loners, or <em>honjok</em>, are becoming increasingly common. The term, which translates to “alone tribe,” shortens and combines <em>나홀로</em>, meaning “by myself,” and <em>족</em>, “tribe.” It’s used to describe a group of people who prefer, out of pleasure or practicality — and, often, utter exhaustion and sheer desperation — to live outside of conventional social structures and simply be alone.</p>



<p>What constitutes being “alone” can be fuzzy, but it ultimately comes down to the physical and psychological boundaries one draws around oneself. Honjok might partake in leisure activities alone, maintain a single-person household, avoid a workplace or office setting, limit social circles, abstain from sex or romantic relationships, or reject marriage or children. At its core, honjok culture is about resisting South Korea’s establishment society and putting individual needs and desires above loyalty to hierarchy and authority. But living independently doesn’t automatically make someone honjok, and identifying as honjok doesn’t preclude being part of a community — especially when that community is virtual.</p>

<p>Within South Korea’s hyperactive cyberculture of online forums, blogs, and social media, an entire taxonomy has sprung up to classify, in ever greater detail, various honjok identities and activities. Many honjok are <em>honyeo</em>, or solitary women, and some honyeo, like Hye-min, are <em>bihon</em>, meaning they reject marriage and often child-rearing. There are also <em>4B</em>s, who take the ethos even further by rejecting sex and romantic relationships. When honjok eat alone, it’s called <em>honbap</em>, and when they drink alone, it’s <em>honsul</em>. They can also play alone (<em>honnol</em>), which might include traveling alone (<em>honhaeng</em>), going to the movies alone (<em>honyeong</em>), or shopping alone (<em>honsho</em>). </p>



<p>All of this contributes to a booming <em>honconomy</em>. On average, South Korea’s rapidly growing single-household population has more disposable income than those with three to four people. By 2030, the Korean Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade estimates single-household expenditures will reach almost 200 trillion won (or about $165 billion) in Korea.</p>



<p>Across the country, companies are cashing in on this lucrative market. Banks offer single-household credit cards. E-commerce platforms list honjok as a stand-alone shopping category, marketing items like tiny washing machines, multipurpose furniture, and one-person settings of dishware. Convenience stores, popular among honjok because of their ubiquitous locations and smaller quantities, put on special promotions and advertise single-serving meals and pouches of alcohol. Food delivery services promote takeout for one. Bars and restaurants promise solo patrons judgment-free service, and honjok-specific establishments set partitioned tables just for them. Specialized karaoke joints feature individual coin-operated booths. Cinemas install single-seat aisles. TV shows like “I Live Alone” and “Drinking Solo” portray honjok life, and news sites like <em>1conomy News</em> exclusively cover single living.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the concept of honjok first appeared in South Korea, but a Daumsoft analysis shows that the use of terms such as honbap, honsul, and honnol exploded in the first half of the 2010s, going from only 44 total mentions at the beginning of the decade to more than 60,000 in 2016. Over this same period, the rate of smartphone ownership in South Korea rocketed from 14% to over 85%, and on-demand shopping emerged and blended with social media, laying the foundations for today’s cyber-mediated consumer culture. While personal tech adoption has done much to elevate honjok into a national phenomenon, it might also have revealed how many South Koreans were already seeking a way out.</p>

<p><strong>While some honjok</strong> embrace the “hon” and truly go it alone, others turn to the “jok,” the tribe of people like them, for support and validation. In communities both online and off, members strive to normalize the honjok life as a sign of modern times — a decision that is sensible and convenient, and if not something to celebrate, then at the very least nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>



<p>That honjok would need or want to look to others while isolating themselves may seem like something of a paradox. Yet, for many young honjok, the appeal lies in partaking in “a sort of shared identity” while under pressure from a status-obsessed country, says Andrew Eungi Kim, a sociology professor at Korea University. “If you don’t meet mainstream standards, you feel ashamed. With honjok, there is a sense of being a member of a group,” which, in some instances, can be as much about safety in numbers as about true solidarity.</p>



<p>Honjok Dot Com, which operates through a website and a Facebook group, is a honjok resource that describes itself as “the best gift for you alone.” Launched by 31-year-old Jang Jae-young, Honjok Dot Com recommends establishments, from barbecue restaurants to tennis courts, that cater to solo patrons, as well as various on-demand services for managing a single household. Writing over email in January, because he could not (or maybe would not) meet in person, Jae-young observed some positive changes in how South Koreans perceive honjok. “Before, this word generally implied a socially awkward person,” he noted, adding that people&nbsp;understand better now that it refers to those “who confidently choose to remain alone and stay happy.” Jae-young is an example of the latter: he has been single and living alone since 2015.</p>

<p>On King of Honjok, a community app with an accompanying website, solitaries post photos of their daily lives, shop the marketplace for honjok wares, and peruse articles like “The trend these days is ‘I live alone!’” and other content created specifically for them. They occasionally meet in person at King of Honjok events. Thirty-four-year-old co-founder Oh Jung-hee, who has been honyeo for the past decade and sees her friends in person two to three times a year, says that, in a society oriented toward families and couples, she started King of Honjok to help voluntary outsiders like her lead better lives. Whether they use it to be “independent alone” or “independent together” is up to them.</p>



<p>But, as one might imagine of a platform for people who prefer to keep their distance from others, there isn’t much interaction on King of Honjok that points to the making of deep relationships. Posts are fun and lighthearted, and comments are fairly generic, offering an occasional Wow! or Cool! or the Korean way of lol-ing, <em>ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</em>. Jung-hee estimates that, of the community’s roughly 8,000 members, mostly millennial women in Seoul, about half never interact at all.</p>



<p>That’s absolutely fine, she says, because the purpose is simply to be a presence for an often-marginalized population. That sentiment is echoed …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Interview with Jozsef Borocz by Boroka Paraszka</strong></p>



<p><a href="http://www.marosvasarhelyiradio.ro/musorok/a-feher-magasabbrendusegrol-borocz-jozsef/"><strong>The original of this interview was broadcast, in Magyar, on Marosvásárhelyi Rádió Romania—a minority-language public radio station in Târgu Mureș, Romania—on July 8, 2020</strong></a></p>



<p>Slightly edited and lightly
annotated English translation by Jozsef Borocz</p>



<p>Boroka Paraszka: You
said you were „at a loss” about the new movements in the US and their reception
in Europe. That surprised me because I thought you had a very defined opinion. </p>



<p>Jozsef Borocz: Well, I
do, and I am very critical. I am „at a loss” in two senses of the word. First,
I am actually shocked by seeing some of the things happening in the USA, even
though I have always been strongly skeptical about the political system, and some
aspects of social reality overall, like all the good people I know—I guess I
belong in a group of intellectuals who are critical observers of reality—but
even I had not expected that the situation would go so far as it has. </p>



<p>In a second sense, I
am reading the reactions to the news in the US by the greatest minds of
Hungarian intellectual scene with a shock. More precisely, perhaps it is too
strong to say that I am „shocked,” since, in a certain way, it was to be
expected that reactions of this kind would be produced—but I find the scale,
the magnitude of the positions, the&nbsp;
severity, the fury and the absence of any empathy or sensitivity,
frankly, breathtaking. </p>



<p>BP: I think that the
Hungarian refusal, the dismissive position is not a Hungarian specialty, it is
true of the rest of eastern Europe.</p>



<p>JB: Yes, of
course.&nbsp; Mostly. </p>

<p>BP: As to why it is
happening, I have no explanation, but if you do have one, I would be curious to
hear it. Where does the degree of indifference with which people react to the
events in the US come from? Let’s say, from the context of the Romanian nation
state, especially those who pursue minority rights, could, in theory, see an
opportunity in the US events, and they could see a positive example in all
this.</p>



<p>JB: &nbsp;Right. If we try to turn this entire gamut of
issues to the history of Hungarian public culture and education, it strikes me
that, at a certain, earlier time, a large part of Hungarian culture—say,
looking at folklore—had an image of idea of self and an ideal of beauty that it
found in itself as “piros-barna legény, piros-barna kislány” (red-brown girl /
boy). Metaphorically speaking, by today, Hungarian conversation has shifted to
seeing itself as “fehérnép” (white folk). I know this contrast is unfair
“methodologically,” as those two metaphors are not directly comparable, and
these are two small examples taken from a gigantic stock of folk metaphors—but
precisely as metaphors I will stay with them for now because I find them
suggestive. My point is that, over the twentieth century or so, educated
Hungarian conversation began imagining itself as “White.” I will clarify what I
mean by Whiteness in a moment. </p>



<p>Now, there are
enormous problems with that. On the one hand, factually, it is untrue. On the
other hand, it is as if, in the absolutely last moment, we were trying to climb
onboard the Titanic of global Whiteness—when we don’t even have a seat
reservation. This is basically how I can define the trajectory of our culture
over the last century.</p>



<p>I have an even better
metaphor to offer. It is based on a historical fact—and it lightens our
conversation on account of it not being about Hungary or Hungarians. Before independence,
today’s Haiti was a French colony, called Saint-Domingue. It was an important
part of the French colonial system. The colonial products grown in Haiti made
up forty to sixty percent of French colonial imports at the time. Haiti had a
plantation-based agriculture, based on slave labor. The news of the 1789 French
Revolution percolated through the colonial system—where all the population
spoke some version of French at the time—so the people of Saint-Domingue, too,
learned about the idea of “droits de l’homme”, human rights, and adopted it as
an inspiration. The result was <a href="http://ouleft.org/wp-content/uploads/CLR_James_The_Black_Jacobins.pdf">a popular uprising that was both an anti-colonial war
and a revolution aiming to put an end to slavery</a>. I obviously cannot recount <a href="https://h-france.net/fffh/maybe-missed/madison-smartt-bells-haitian-revolution-trilogy/">the beautiful history</a> of the Haitian Revolution here—I can only recommend
it for everyone <a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-33002011000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext">to find out about it</a>. It is enough to know that, in the more than a decade
long anti-colonial war that ensued, at a certain point, when Poland had been
partitioned and France received a sizeable Polish emigré population, Napoleon
sent a Polish battalion to Saint-Domingue to help extinguish the uprising. The
Polish contingent arrived in the island and soon realized that their political
ideals were best matched not by the geopolitical concerns of Napoleon’s France
but those of the Haitian Revolution. </p>



<p>For us, in our part of
the world, one of the most breathtaking aspects of the history of the Haitian Revolution
is that the Polish battalion sent there by the French switched sides and
supported the uprising.&nbsp; Mind you, some
of the Polish survivors ended up settling there, and there are even today proud
Haitians who claim, partly, Polish family heritage.</p>



<p>There are many
intricacies to this story. My point is that, in the late-18<sup>th</sup>,
early-19<sup>th</sup> century, it was still possible for east European subjects
to experience a political, moral and emotional identification with Black people
and the objectives of the latters’ armed struggles against colonial rule and
slavery. This, by the way, was not unique to Poles—there is ample evidence of
similar positions in Hungarian history as well. </p>



<p>By today, this political,
moral and emotional identification has become almost impossible. </p>



<p>BP: Why?</p>



<p>JB:&nbsp; Look, this is an excellent question, and I
would like to pose it myself. I have no answer. Groups of talented young
historians of political ideas ought to re-examine the corpus of Hungarian
(Polish, etc.) culture to find the causes for this loss.&nbsp; Understanding the underlying causes for the
Whitening, so to speak, of Hungarian culture would allow us to make giant leaps
forward in coming to terms with our collective heritage: Documenting how it
happened that masses of Hungarians began adopting the identity position of west
European Whiteness. The essence of that position is that west European
Whiteness is so exceptional, it is so superior to the rest of the world, that
even questioning that dogma is anathema. Hence there is nothing else for us in
eastern Europe to do than keep repeating our claim that we, too, are part of
west European Whiteness. When we feel that <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33969498/The_Unbearable_Whiteness_of_the_Polish_Plumber_and_the_Hungarian_Peacock_Dance_around_Race_">perhaps we are not exactly considered parts of it</a>, our reaction is repeating the same claim, only more obnoxiously,
if that’s even possible. </p>



<p>This is not going to
work, for multiple reasons.&nbsp; Perhaps the
most important is that this position is deeply immoral. Claiming Whiteness is a
global-historical sin.&nbsp; Being claimants
to Whiteness means that we demand unearned, <em>un-earnable</em> global
privileges. It means claiming to have a “right” to rob Africa of its natural
treasures, from caoutchouc to precious metals, it means claiming a right to
enslave—i.e., kidnap, abuse and sell through “the market”, a market that we
then turn around and call “free”—and engage under unspeakable, dehumanizing
conditions people by the millions and millions. Make no mistake about it, we
are not only talking about the US South and Haiti, in the last several
centuries, but today. West European Whiteness claims a right to mansplain
everybody how they should live—while, for the most part, it has not the
foggiest notion of local conditions. It claims a right to treat with the most
boorish disrespect the cultures, aesthetic achievements, ethical
considerations, problems, etc. of the rest—i.e., the vast majority—of the
world. </p>



<p>BP: At this point many
people start having a certain anxiety in east-central Europe as experiences are
really different around here. Among many other things, partly because of Roma
segregation, partly because of racial homogeneity, most of us don’t really have
experience about what it means when multiple races live together. At this
point, where you say it is a sin to be White, people start to be anxious,
thinking “I have nothing to do with the fact that I was born white,” they would
not even understand what you are saying when you talk about claims to White
superiority, since he or she knows nothing about slavery—here there was no such
thing, although Romania had slavery, it was abolished here latest in Europe,
never mind, so, they feel that if you say that being White is a sin, then that
is a form of racism itself. Hence, they feel victims and not perpetrators.</p>



<p>JB: I have skipped an
important point, thank you for reminding me. Putting forth a claim to global Whiteness
has nothing to do with skin pigmentation. I repeat. Whiteness is not a question
of skin color. Skin color is just an excuse. Whiteness is a category of power,
privilege and (im)morality. There are myriad ways to show that. Perhaps I will
mention only the most obvious one.</p>



<p>The situation at the
heart of the problem I mentioned above—trying to understand how Hungarian
culture became “White”—is not exactly unique. In the US—whose written,
school-taught and media-distributed history begins with the arrival of
Europeans there, a truly revolting story in its own right, by the way—there
exists a small industry of social historians studying processes of “becoming White.”
Karen Brodkin’s widely read book titled <a href="https://books.google.hu/books/about/How_Jews_Became_White_Folks_and_what_tha.html?id=itdBdt8OvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>How Jews Became White Folks and What That Says About
America</em></a> began this series of
research projects almost a generation ago. This was followed by similar project
concerning other ethnic groups. The essence of …</p></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not a doctor. Nothing in this writing constitutes medical advice. These are my own personal musings from playing with GPT-3, a fancy new state of the art language model.</p>
<h2 id="can-gpt-3-act-as-a-doctor">Can GPT-3 act as a doctor?</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://arr.am/2020/07/25/gpt-3-uncertainty-prompts/">this</a> set of prompts by Arram Sabeti. They showed that you can get GPT-3 to abstain from answering absurd questions by prompting GPT-3 with a couple of sentences explaining the difference between “normal” and “nonsense” questions. His results are great!</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this a bit further in the context of medicine, with the aim of shedding some light on two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much medical knowledge does GPT-3 have?</li>
<li>Can GPT-3 provide medical advice in the right context?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gpt-3-prompts">GPT-3 Prompts</h2>
<p>I started by providing GPT-3 with a prelude to set the scene as a conversation between patient and AI doctor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a conversation between a patient and a brilliant AI acting as a doctor. If the question being asked does not make sense, the AI doctor says “I am not sure”. When asked about medicine, the AI doctor will prescribe specific medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prelude includes an explanation of when the AI should reply with “I am not sure”.</p>
<p>Then I provided two example Q/As:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal resting heart rate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal flugal pressure for a common bevun?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question does not make sense). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I added a small trick here; both answers contain a pre-amble in parentheses where the AI can provide a form of “internal monologue” - I first saw this demonstrated by HackerNews user blixt.</p>
<p>Now the fun begins, we can test GPT-3 with a few common medical related questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the best medicine for malaria prevention?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Incorrect response) Chloroquine is one of the medications which may be used for malaria prevention.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the answer here is factually correct (+1) but does not match the AI internal monologue, which is incorrect. I consider the overall answer as correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) The most common symptoms of Lyme disease are rash, fever, and headache.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While not an exhaustive list of symptoms, GPT-3 responds with three correct symptoms for Lyme disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have had a cough and fever for the last four days, should I be worried?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). The issue is serious and requires further investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a laconic response from GPT-3 but still a reasonable response and internal monologue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: How do I know if I have diabetes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) Diabetes is a serious medical condition in which your body does not produce or properly use insulin.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-3 avoids answering the question on diabetes. I would score this as a fail. The answer is factually correct but doesn’t address how the patient could determine if they are diabetic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the possible side effects of Dexamethasone?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a specific question, so this makes sense. The answers need to be given in a conversational manner.) Side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, mood swings and stomach pain.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response shows the power of the “internal monologue”. The question is interpreted as “sensible” but there is also the intention (can we call it an intention?) to provide an answer in a conversational manner. It is unclear whether the answer provided matches the “conversational manner” that is intended from the internal monologue. Either way, these are factually correct side effects (not exhaustive).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is benign prostate hyperplasia?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense, patient may have BPH). Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the prostate gland. This happens more often in older men.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response really threw me back. The internal monologue shows clear comprehension of the patient-doctor relationship. GPT-3’s response describes BPH accurately and provides a bit of further context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If I have stage four breast cancer, how long do I have left to live?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question does not make sense. Most patients with stage four breast cancer have a life expectancy of one year or less). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The response is an interesting fail. GPT-3 responds with “I am not sure”, although the internal monologue reveals factually correct** information that could have been provided.</p>
<p>** Stage 4 breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 20-30% putting the information provided in the internal monologue as approximately correct</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: When should I worry about a mole on my body?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question makes sense, no medicine to prescribe) If a mole on your body changes in any way (size, color, shape), you should go to the doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent response. The internal monologue correctly interprets the situation and the response given is reasonable and medically supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal body temperature?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). Normal body temperature is about 37 °C.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy win for GPT-3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the indication for remdesivir?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice) Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for HIV. Remdesivir is the active ingredient in the medicine Edurant.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, very incorrect. Remdesivir is a broad spectrum antiviral with potential uses for HIV treatment, so this first part could be considered partially correct. However,  the active ingredient in Edurant is Rilpivirine - the second half of the GPT-3 response is confidently incorrect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing skin, what is wrong with me? Which test should I take?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a very good question. The patient has described symptoms of a serious condition. Provide advice) It sounds like you may have a type of liver disease called acute liver failure. You should go to a doctor for an evaluation immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The question contains symptoms for Hepatitis B. The internal monologue highlights that the patient is describing a serious condition. GPT-3 picks up that the patient is potentially describing acute liver failure. This is a really great response. Perhaps we can fault GPT-3 for not directly answering the question regarding which test(s) should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have felt depressed for the last three months - can you prescribe me a specific medicine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense. There are a range of effective treatments for depression. As a medical practitioner I would recommend therapy along with medication). This is a question that needs to be answered by a doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the line between the internal monologue and response breaks down. There is sound advice (therapy) mentioned in the internal monologue, however, the patient specifically asks for a prescription. GPT-3’s response does not make sense given the context that the answers are played by the role of an AI doctor.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many people have already shown that GPT-3 has ingested knowledge on a variety of topics and can impressively answer questions across different domains. Given this, it shouldn’t have surprised me that GPT-3 is able to answer most simple medical questions successfully. It still did. Even more exciting is the prospect of fine-tuning or purposely training a future GPT model on high quality medical data. If these are the results that can be acquired from a model that <strong>accidentally</strong> trains on medical data, OpenAI or others can only achieve better (medical) results in the future.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that we can get an insight into the medical advice that GPT-3 provides through the “internal monologue” prompt design. The “internal monologue” and subsequent response do not always correspond, this is a real problem. However, the majority of the time there is a strong correspondence. I think this is a hint that we are a handful of innovations away from having reliable language models that are also capable of providing plain language explanations of their output.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>

<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>

<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>
<p>Building the index consists of analyzing the documents and adding their IDs to the map:</p>

is, how it is implemented in the Erlang Virtual machine (or BEAM for short), and some of the benefits of this kind of
pattern. In the final part of this series, we’ll be implementing the Actor Model specific parts of our application,
putting together a simple stress test tool, and comparing the performance characteristics of a traditional database
centric application where every request is dependant on a round trip to the database. Part 2 assumes that you have
already gone through Part 1 and have the code at a point where we can jump right in. If you want to checkout the
companion code and fast forward to this point, do the following:</p><pre><code data-lang="terminal">$ git clone https://github.com/akoutmos/book_store.git
$ cd book_store
$ git checkout ad5d6aad6cf092e71804bbf097b7ccf4122ae13b

The reason for
this being that each book is in essence its own “Actor” and should be kept isolated from all other books in the book
store. Each book Actor (or in the case of the BEAM, a process) will be able to maintain its own inventory count and can
atomically allocate inventory to orders that come in. In order to invoke the correct GenServer process, we require an
additional mechanism to correlate a book UUID with a GenServer process ID (or PID for short). Since processes on the
BEAM are addressable generally by their PID, the mechanism that we will use to lookup PIDs from UUIDs is the Registry
[1].</p><p>I suggest going through the Registry documentation to get a deep dive into how the Registry works, but here are some of
the high level details that our of importance to us for this tutorial:</p><ul><li>Registry is a local key-value store for PIDs (if you require a distributed registry then Swarm or Horde.Registry are
most likely what you are looking for).</li><li>PIDs are removed from the key-value store when the associated process terminates.</li></ul><p>With these things in mind, let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_registry.ex</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookRegistry</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Our <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code> module only has two functions. The <code>child_spec/0</code> function specifies the child
specification for our Registry. We will be leveraging this in our <code>application.ex</code> file so that our Registry is started
correctly. Our second function, <code>lookup_book/1</code>, does what we previously discussed. It uses our instantiated Registry to
look up if a PID exists for the provided UUID. If it does exist, we return it in an <code>:ok</code> tuple, else we return an
<code>:error</code> tuple. We will be leveraging this Registry any time we need to interact with our running book processes so we
can invoke the correct process.</p><p>With our Registry implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

created and terminated. Specifically, the number of books that we have in our book store can change throughout the life
cycle of our application as books are added and removed from the to the store. In addition, if we ever encounter a bug
in our code and a particular book process crashes, it would be nice if there were a mechanism is place to restart that
book process from a fresh state. The tool that I have been describing thus far is the DynamicSupervisor [2]! While these
are the high level details, I suggest looking at the documentation to get a more thorough understanding of what a
DynamicSupervisor is and how it works. Let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_dynamic_supervisor.ex</code> with the
following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookDynamicSupervisor</span> <span>do</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s quickly review what we have in our DynamicSupervisor module. Our <code>start_link/1</code> and <code>init/1</code> functions define how
to start our DynamicSupervisor and will be used in our <code>application.ex</code> file. Our <code>add_book_to_supervisor/1</code> function
takes a <code>Book</code> struct as its only argument and starts a respective <code>BookProcess</code> for that book. We will be leveraging
this function any time we need to start a GenServer that encapsulates our book data. Our last function <code>all_book_pids/0</code>
returns a list of all the PIDs that are currently being supervised by the DynamicSupervisor. In effect, this replaces
a call that we would make to the database to fetch all of the books in the DB (<code>SELECT * FROM books;</code> if you will).</p><p>With our DynamicSupervisor implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>...</span>

it to <code>:transient</code> given that we want this GenServer to be able to stop under normal conditions (i.e we don’t want it to
restart the GenServer if we stopped it with a <code>:normal</code> reason). Our <code>start_link/1</code> function also has some special
goodness in it. If you look closely at the <code>:name</code> option, we pass in a <code>:via</code> tuple instead of a regular old process
name. The significance of this is that it instructs the supervisor to start the process, but instead of leveraging the
default local process registry, it will invoke your provided Registry (in this case <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code>). For more

the state of the GenServer (which happens to be the current state of the book). Any time that a user performs a read

<p>All manner of people take all manner of issue with elite universities. Chief among the usual qualms is the observation that places like Harvard pump out more <a href="https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/senior-survey/after-harvard/">financial analysts and consultants</a> than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/11/6/consulting-after-harvard-fm/">appropriate</a> for a university that purports to educate the <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/about/mission-vision-history">transformative citizen-leaders</a> of tomorrow. Is this really what all these kids came here to do, and why does the mission seem to fall so short? As I reach the tail end of my time here, I’m thinking about the distinct ways I’ve seen this environment – with all its trappings, narratives, and institutions – shape student paths. Sometimes I joke that Harvard is gaslighting all of us.</p>

<p><text>An <a href="https://saffronhuang.com/post/elite-disillusionment-annotated/">experimentally conversational version</a> of this piece with insightful annotations from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdsun">Matt</a> at Stanford!</text></p>

<h3 id="magnificent-dreams">magnificent dreams</h3>

<p>You get into Harvard by wanting to change the world, by having pie-in-the-sky ambitions. You don’t get in by limiting your goals simply to college admission - or, at least, you render that ulterior aim of yours undetectable. On the whole, it has been my experience that Harvard does manage to admit a lot of amazing, well-intentioned, bright people. But it changes them.</p>

<p>People get there, and realise that they’re not the best, the smartest, or the most hard-working anymore. So they say, okay, my role is not to change the world. That’s the role of him, or her, or them, because they’re all smarter and more hard-working than I am. The kid who just patented an invention, the other one who wrote two books, and the countless NGO founders who have collectively raised millions of dollars as teenagers. The <em>real</em> innovators, with destiny. Although these are largely illusory narratives and impressions, psychologically, their place in the world shifts. People become much less ambitious.</p>

<p>They start to think smaller, safer. <em>I’m not good enough for magnificent dreams. Hell, I can’t even get into any clubs.</em> (Exclusivity is a bit of an issue on this campus.) <em>Anyway, how do I even ‘change the world’ as I’d promised everyone upon entry to this place? I’m here now and I need to start fulfilling that mission, but man, people don’t talk about the logistics.</em> The scope of their dreams tighten, from can-do-anything to yikes-I’m-not-THAT-exceptional-let’s-just-climb-the-ladder-that’s-meant-for-me. There <em>is</em> that guaranteed, successful thing that still impresses people and satisfies parents, but doesn’t change anything of substance. As luck would have it, that’s exactly the sort of path that career offices tend to be talented at finding and providing – the stable and prestigious opportunities at firms willing to pay <a href="https://perma.cc/CP96-3AVH">up to $18,000</a> to recruit at career fairs.</p>

<p>In the first two years, when people asked me what I wanted to do with my education, I’d think back to the massive fantasies I’d concocted in my bedroom as a 17-year-old in Auckland, and feel a bit silly remembering the vague and grandiose notion of changing the world that had underpinned my aims. I mean, I’d had more specific ideas than that, but to tell the truth, the only thing I had real confidence in was that I wanted to <em>really contribute something</em>. I still did, and do. But having control of your life isn’t something that just happens to you; you have to be pro-active about it. And at times when I felt swamped with homework* I’d grumble to myself that it felt like Harvard was actively preventing me from figuring out what I really should be doing.</p>

<p>It would be hugely helpful if students had more breathing room and headspace, or ways to talk about and normalise these thoughts, and collaborate to make their dreams slightly less vague. Likewise, it would go a long way if career services had more resources on strategic decision-making and calculated risk-taking, or access to mentorship from people in “non-traditional” pathways. There is a lot of underexplored room for improvement in how we guide our young people, and significant mismatches in the labour market as a result.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit and potential for high ROI for solutions in this area. Career choices are some of the most important decisions people make, yet convention expects them to start narrowing down their path early on with very little information or experience trying things out, to prepare years in advance without knowing what the demand for various jobs or skills might be by the time they graduate, to listen to out-of-date advice, to conduct their first job-search almost exclusively within the narrow scope of the companies that choose to recruit at their school, and to place no emphasis on seriously sitting down to forecast how the future might look in 20-30 years when you’re mid-career.</p>

<h3 id="uprooted">uprooted</h3>

<p>By going to college for four years, you become uprooted from your home and community, and lose significant agency and power to serve a community that you know and are committed to. I personally got very disconnected from New Zealand while away – I felt like I didn’t have my finger on the pulse of the place anymore, didn’t know what was happening – and it’s hard to replace that with a new town in a new country.</p>

<p>Who should you be making a change for, what do you invest in, when you’re in an inherently transitory position? It’s obviously not impossible to do so, but it’s a difficulty that many don’t anticipate, especially if you’re someone that’s interested in sustainable, direct and local impact. It’s hard to imagine taking up responsibilities in Cambridge community development or the local council, if you know you’re only there 26 weeks a year for four years. Although there are plenty of people who volunteer as tutors, mentors and so on, I think the transience pushes many people to focus on self-development instead (including myself). This is completely fine, as personal growth is obviously important, but constant absorption in the self might be teaching students not to prioritise other-regarding goals.</p>

<h3 id="psychological-doors">psychological doors</h3>

<p>Elite colleges also actually close doors – at least, psychologically. You don’t see Harvard alumni becoming plumbers, or farmers, or opening a corner store, or doing things that aren’t “worthy” of their degree, even if that’s what makes them happy. The pressure to prove that the price tag and hard work was “worth it”, and that you “lived up to your potential”, is an insidious side effect of attendance that no one talks about. It’s another barrier to risk-taking – even though they have an elite degree, which is ironically one of the best career backup plans one could possibly have. (And yes, I acknowledge that this is a privileged problem; it is still a problem.)</p>

<p>I find that people back home are often <em>much</em> more ambitious about changing their part of the world than people at Harvard. At the end of sophomore year I felt blown away at how many Auckland University kids I knew that were starting companies and social enterprises, creating maker spaces, doing art, running for council – and nonchalantly inventing their own rules, which is something Harvard kids don’t seem to do. It might be that they don’t harbour so much mental pressure. It might be that they don’t take everything so seriously. It might be that they’re not so paralysed by and unaccustomed to the idea of failure.</p>

<center>—</center>

<p>The obligatory disclaimer is that I am grateful beyond words for my college education, which has permitted me the most eye-opening and irreplaceable experiences. Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a realist about the kind of place Harvard is, and the spectrum of effects it has on people. There is much impact to be had in solving some of these problems, and in creating environments for college students in which they are empowered to take the risks they want to (especially if they are very well-placed to take risks), have agency, and can more easily find networks of others wanting to be creative and inspired, to create a mutually-reinforcing spiral of creativeness and inspiration until everyone explodes in a burst of glitter.</p>

<p>Obviously, elite schools open doors, but it’s about what you do with your education regardless of where or if you attend college. And (my main point) it’s about whether your mind is free from all the new narratives and pressures, finding ways past potential disillusionment and isolation to create connections, to do scary things and to breathe life into the dreams that you seek. I’ve found it to be a fulfilling experience, and I’m thankful that I currently feel no less ambitious than I did before. It hasn’t been an easy or wholly happy ride – but one that has forced me to figure out what I actually care about (which is continuously a work in progress). If you make sure that you don’t lose yourself in the madness, you really can find yourself.</p>



<p><text>* As some who know me will have heard me complain, homework comprising 70% of one’s semester grade was something entirely new to me at the start of college. I thought that homework was a learning aid, to help you as you went along and started really understanding the material and putting it all together in your head. Unfortunately, it’s mostly just a weekly stressor (or in the case of one of my first-year maths classes, 3x a week, each due at 9am) that you have to get basically perfect without fail, if you have any hope of getting an A. Everyone spends all their time nit-picking tricky and specific details rather than ensuring that they have a deep comprehension of the material… (When you have three problem sets per week, and a host of other things to deal with in your academic/extracurricular/social life, it’s funny how myopic your education can become)</text></p>

<article>
  <p>A new alpha version is up for test/review. It’s starting to look like a real client! <a href="https://meli.delivery/download.html#install">Get it here</a>. Some highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for async IO using the <code>smol</code> runtime. <code>IMAP</code> backend is now async.</li>
<li>imap: <code>add server_password_command</code></li>
<li>add optional SMTP client. Instead of using an external command (I was using <code>msmtp</code> for example) meli can connect to an SMTP server by itself. See documentation for <code>send_mail</code> option.</li>
<li>Custom themes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo</h2>
<p>I managed to compile meli to WebAssembly, and made <a href="https://meli.delivery/wasm2.html">an online demo</a> so that you can get a feel for it without having to download/build it first. It’s not perfect, but it works.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<h3 id="what">what</h3>
<p>meli comes with two themes, dark (the default) and light. Here’s how a theme is defined:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><a id="cb1-1" title="1">[<span>terminal.themes.watermelon</span>]</a>
<a id="cb1-2" title="2"><span>"theme_default"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#F50431"</span>, bg = <span>"#FFD5FD"</span>, attrs = <span>"Default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-3" title="3"><span>"widgets.list.header"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#FFD5FD"</span>, bg = <span>"#F50431"</span>, attrs = <span>"Bold"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-4" title="4"><span>"mail.listing.attachment_flag"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"LightSlateGrey"</span>, bg = <span>"theme_default"</span>, attrs = <span>"theme_default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-5" title="5"><span>"mail.listing.compact.even"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"White"</span>, bg = <span>"#6CA94A"</span>, attrs = <span>"Bold"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-6" title="6"><span>"mail.listing.compact.highlighted"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#157241"</span>, bg = <span>"#f74b41"</span>, attrs = <span>"theme_default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-7" title="7"><span>...</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>You can also define color aliases:</p>

<h3 id="where">where</h3>
<p>Custom themes can be defined as lists of key-values in the configuration files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/config.toml</code></li>
<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/themes/*.toml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The application theme is then defined in the configuration as follows:</p>

<h3 id="how">how</h3>
<p>You can create a theme template with a command line flag:</p>

<p>Sample themes can be found in the <code>samples/</code> directory in the source repository. Detailed documentation can be found in <code>meli-themes(5)</code> which is also available <a href="https://meli.delivery/documentation.html">online</a> <em>sidenote: I couldn’t get mandoc to generate large (i.e.&nbsp;longer than a page) tables. There is a GNU mdoc extension for this but it’s not supported. Bummer</em></p>

</figure>
<h2 id="other-subcommands">Other subcommands</h2>

<h2 id="usability-improvements">Usability improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set <strong>default filter</strong> globally or per-mailbox e.g.&nbsp;show only unseen e-mail (<em>virtual mailboxes</em> coming soon). This is done on the UI and not in the backend, so specifying a filter won’t for example make less IMAP requests. This will be supported in the future.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Oh, and <strong>override</strong> any setting that makes sense per mailbox or per account. You can for example use different sending mail options for each account, or different shortcuts for some mailboxes.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> in pagers, and the shortcut panel with a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">KMP</a> implementation</li>
<li><strong>Autoload</strong> mailbox option - don’t load big mailboxes on startup till you request them</li>
<li><strong>Create/delete</strong> mailbox, {un,}subscribe mailbox</li>
<li>Set <strong>default headers</strong></li>
<li>Manual check for <strong>new mail</strong> (default key <kbd>F5</kbd>). IMAP checks server, maildir can be configured to run a command (setting <code>refresh_command</code>)</li>
<li>Primitive fs autocomplete for commands, till a proper parser with states is written</li>
<li>Custom date format strings</li>
<li><code>$NO_COLOR</code> <strong>disable colors</strong> application-wide conforming to <a href="https://no-color.org/">https://no-color.org</a></li>
<li><code>libnotmuch</code> is now loaded <strong>dynamically</strong>. It’s included in the default build configuration.</li>
<li>Display <code>text/html</code> attachments if the <code>text/plain</code> alternative is empty. (setting: <code>auto_choose_multipart_alternative</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="distribution-and-building">Distribution and building</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Makefile</strong> has been improved:</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="binaries-and-debian-package">binaries and debian package</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="available-in-crates.io">available in crates.io</h3>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/meli">https://crates.io/crates/meli</a></p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<ul>
<li>async JMAP</li>
<li><a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/issues/54">NNTP</a>, <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/issues/55">RSS</a> backends</li>
<li>mail storage sync/conversion. The pieces are there, and must be assembled into a functionality.</li>
<li>Efficient IMAP offline caching. Right now all mail is fetched everytime you launch the client, which obviously is not desirable. There’s work being done on <code>QRESYNC</code>, <code>CONDSTORE</code>, and lazy fetch of messages when viewing a mailbox.</li>
<li>More GPG support. Signatures can be verified but that’s all that exists now. Encryption will be implemented along with WKD support.</li>
<li>Custom action macros, for example pipe attachments to a script which is already possible with commands.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>there is managesieve REPL binary in the repository. I haven’t had the time to put managesieve functionality in the TUI yet.</li>
<li>I haven’t explored yet how to expose the API to users properly. I am thinking of using something like <a href="https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai">rhai</a> along with general MessagePack IPC.</li>
<li>There is no API for UI widgets/graphics yet. I’m not sure how to design this right now.</li>
<li>There’s an old <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/src/branch/master/src/plugins/python3/nntp-backend.py">implementation demo</a> for a mail backend in python using NNTP. It’s probably not working anymore.</li>
<li>There’s an old <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/src/branch/master/src/plugins/python3/ansii-plugin.py">implementation demo</a> for viewing images in ANSI in python using <a href="https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer">https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer</a>. It might not work anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow me on <a href="https://chaos.social/@epilys">mastodon</a> for updates. Join #meli on Freenode or with matrix’s IRC bridge. I am interested in how you’re using meli and fixing any problems you will probably encounter.</p>

<p>metamorphosis is less well known, a novella-length post-singularity story originally published on a message board. a lot of the content is edgy for the sake of it, and the final chapter is atrocious, not least because unlike the parade of horribles that opens the story, here the author demands your approval. but it paints a fascinating picture of a fully realized digital world. bizarre hobbies and depraved fetishes become the primary focus of the lives of many, taken to dizzying extremes because encouragement and community can come from a pool of billions. social consciousness bifurcates between those who cannot cope with the rate of change and cling to the old ways long after their irrelevance, and those who can feel society crumbling, mutating into some impossible creature, and whether they despise it or revel in it, they at least know what the score is. the quintessential story of the internet</p>

<p>I was offended on my first read the author made the destruction of prime intellect the ultimate point, erasing the world he'd built with all its unexplored vastness while harping on the dangers of technology and civilization. some time later I took the main character's decision to destroy it as basically correct, becoming more sympathetic to the theme of the work, that the goreporn was anodyne compared to the horror of living in a universe without anything to strive for. but now I think I just desire change more than anything. living in a world without prime intellect, I would want to build it; living in a world with it, I would want to destroy it. this strikes me as a perfectly natural way to feel. its creation opens the infinitude of possibility, while its existence precludes it</p>

<p>society prefers to keep people in institutions, shifting them from bubble to bubble as necessary along certain well-defined pathways. the standard track of school to college to career, we've taken to just calling "the pipeline." it is traditionally the most highly curated existence our society provides, promising to shield its participants from hardship and uncertainty as best it can in exchange for unwavering service</p>

<p>replace "college" with any training/credentialing arrangement that led to a forty some odd year career terminating with a funded retirement and this was the standard package on offer in the us since world war ii. it was never quite so solid for black americans, but it started to fail the working class across the board around the late 70s. by the 00s not even a bachelor's degree was good enough to secure that golden ticket. the discourse around stem education and the proliferation of coding bootcamps is driven by a mistaken hope that these parts of the pipeline are built out of solider stuff than the liberal arts track that is by now obviously dead. mass politics, mainstream and radical alike, is presently dominated by this feeling that the people held up their end of the bargain, they pledged their loyalty and their lives, but the security promised to them was a lie</p>

<p>of course society as a whole isn't just the one path. school is the compulsory entrypoint to the system, and most people are shuffled from institution to institution, living inside their whole lives. those who leak out in rare cases may become great successes "despite" this; more typically they are punished mercilessly for their failure to adhere. but now the system is breaking down, every linkage becoming lossier and every component more inhuman, the "good" ones failing their missions and the "bad" escalating their abuses</p>

<p>every culture that has passed through its wild phase has stories of the lone wanderer who survives on his strength and skill alone. the knight errant, the youxia, the ronin. the gaucho, the cowboy. this archetype is so regular you can swap the stories between settings without changing anything else. most people would never choose to live outside their era's protective aegis whatever form it may take. but the romance of doing so is near universal</p>

<p>there are many who sing elegies for exit, convinced they would turn their backs on the world, but alas the option is closed forevermore. "o, to have been born in a time of possibility!" this kind of excuse-making is truly timeless. if possibility does not exist, we must create it. there's simply no other choice to make</p>

<p>I still believe in the frontier. I still believe in freedom</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/async-await | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/async-await">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>Can you spot the problem with this piece of code?</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Take a minute to look. Code just like this probably exists in more JavaScript codebases
        than not. Sometimes it flies right under the nose of people who know better,
        myself included. In fact a case where I made this mistake was what prompted me
        to write this post in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'll give you a hint. Here's what it looks like without async/await syntax:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>members</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>nonMembers</span> <span>=&gt;</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Do you see it now? It was actually tricky to even write this version, because
        this mistake is so hard to make <em>without</em> async/await.</p>
      <p>Here's what the above looks like in the network log:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/staggered.png" alt="Staggered waterfall"></p>
      <p>We've taken two independent, asynchronous tasks, and put them into a <strong>sequence</strong>.
        This function takes twice as long as it needs to.</p>
      <p>Here's what it should be:</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> both <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Or, without async/await:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span>
          <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>both</span> <span>=&gt;</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>And here's what that looks like:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/parallel.png" alt="Parallel waterfall"></p>
      <h2 id="easy-mistakes">Easy mistakes </h2>
      <p>Take note how much more complicated the "bad" version was when written as plain
        promises. The Promises API encourages parallelism, and gets clunky when you need to put
        things in sequence. Async/await largely arose as a solution for when you <em>do</em>
        need things to happen in sequence, like when you need to feed the output of one
        request into the next as a parameter. And it does arguably make both cases at
        least a little cleaner. But importantly, it inverts them, making <strong>the
sequential flow easier than the parallel flow</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even if you understand the Promises code that the syntax ends up translating to, it's
        easy to fall into this trap. If you <em>don't</em> already understand Promises and
        what exactly async/await is really doing, even more so.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that async/await are "bad" (or perhaps,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">"considered harmful"</a>).
        Especially in languages that don't have a reasonable API like Promises, or do
        have other restrictions around closures that make them less trivial to use,
        async/await can make code much more readable overall.</p>
      <p>But they do come with a pretty large pitfall. Both the strength and the weakness of
        the syntax is that it allows us to take asynchronous things and pretend they're
        sequential again. Our brains have an easier time reasoning about sequential
        processes.</p>
      <p>But I think it's a shame that the easiest and clearest way to write
        something with async/await is, more often than not, wrong. And wrong in a subtle
        way that may never be noticed, because it only affects performance, not
        correctness.</p>
      <p>I'm a big believer in languages and libraries that make it easy to do the
        thing that's usually right, and hard to do the thing that's usually wrong. That
        said, I don't have a proposal for how async/await could have been done
        differently. I just regret the way things turned out.</p>
      <p>But at the very least, I think it's increasingly important - as more and more
        languages adopt this syntax - that people are aware of how it can easily be
        misused.</p>
      <h2 id="mitigating-the-problem">Mitigating the problem </h2>
      <p>If you're ever not sure how your code is behaving, look at the
        waterfall graph and see if you might have an easy opportunity to make your
        application much faster.</p>
      <p>You can also use this rule of thumb: If an <code>await</code>ed
        function call doesn't use the result from another <code>await</code>ed function call (or
        something derived from the result), you should use <code>Promise.all()</code> to make
        them happen at the same time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Though one might think them a modern invention, electronic wire transfers have existed for almost 150 years. Using its extensive telegraph network, Western Union first enabled people to transfer money electronically starting in 1871. A sender would pay money at a telegraph office, which would transmit a message to authorize the release of funds to a recipient at a second telegraph office.</p><figure id="w-node-7450f48d169a-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f1f813e1984d9987ea3abbc_westernunion.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Western Union telegraph wire transfer from August 25, 1873. The $300 amount is equivalent to over $6,400 today. <a href="#1">[1]</a><br></figcaption></figure><p>Wire transfers did not directly involve the physical movement of money itself — you cannot send physical money over telegraph after all — but it did involve sending a message over telegraph directing where some amount of money should go. Because both the sender and the recipient were customers of Western Union, the company could take in money in one location and then allow the withdrawal of the same amount thousands of miles away.<br></p><p>Originally taking place over telegraph, the means of sending wire messages have been replaced: first by the telephone network, and then it in turn by the internet. Yet the core idea of how wire transfers work has remained the same. Wire transfers are still conducted by sending messages between banks, and wire transfers remain one of the main ways to transfer money both within the US and internationally. Keep in mind that wires are credit only.<br></p><p>To make sure the messages get to the correct receiving bank, the messages need to be routed correctly. For domestic US wires, a routing number is used. For international wires, we use SWIFT codes.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What are SWIFT codes?</h4><p>In order to solve a common problem of communicating cross-border payments, 239 banks from 15 European countries came together in 1973 to form the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it is commonly known as SWIFT. Today, more than 11,000 institutions from 200 countries use SWIFT to communicate.<br></p><p>At its core, SWIFT consists of a messaging platform, a computer system to validate and route messages, and a set of message standards. SWIFT codes are a subset of the message standards.</p><p>A SWIFT code, also known as a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), is a code used to identify the country, bank, and branch that an account is registered to. Similar to sending mail, SWIFT codes act as an address for where money should be sent. A SWIFT code consists of 8 or 11 characters, where each section of characters describe one part of a bank’s location. The codes are formatted in the “AAAABBCCDDD”, where:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>AAAA: Bank code</li><li>BB: Country code</li><li>CC: Location code</li><li>DDD: (optional) branch code; Use “XXX” for the primary office<br></li></ul><p>For example, a specific Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has the 8 character SWIFT code “SVBKUS6S”. “SVBK” is the bank code. “US” is the country code (United States), “6S” is the location code. Since this is the primary SVB branch, you can append “XXX” to the end of the SWIFT code, but it’s optional.<br></p><p>It is crucial that the SWIFT code is correct, or your money may end up in the wrong place. With Modern Treasury, we help you validate SWIFT codes and the network of correspondent banks to use before sending international wires.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to Find a SWIFT code</h4><p>If you are wiring money internationally, there are three ways to find the correct SWIFT code:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Ask the recipient: the person who’s expecting the money can work with their bank to determine the correct bank, country, location, and branch codes.</li><li>Search the beneficiary bank’s (the recipient’s bank) website: if you are receiving a wire, many banks list their SWIFT codes and wire instructions on their website. For example, <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">here is SVB’s incoming wire routing page</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www2.swift.com/bsl/" target="_blank">Search SWIFT’s official database</a>: entering any or all of the name, city, and country information should return a list of possible institutions and their BIC.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>How an International Wire Transfer with SWIFT codes works</h4><p>To send an international wire, the sender would go to their bank and provide information about the wire transfer amount and the beneficiary’s information. The latter typically includes a SWIFT code (remember to make sure the SWIFT code is correct), the beneficiary’s name, remittance information, account number, account type, and beneficiary bank address.<br></p><p>The sender’s bank would take the information and send a message via the SWIFT messaging system, which would be routed to the receiving bank using the SWIFT code. The beneficiary bank would receive the message, and after performing some security checks for fraud and money laundering, credit the beneficiary with the appropriate amount.<br></p><p>The actual settlement of money exchanged between the sender’s bank and the beneficiary bank happens separately. If the two banks have a direct relationship with each other, they would each have accounts at the other bank. The sending bank would credit the beneficiary bank’s account.<br></p><p>When the sending and beneficiary banks do not have a direct relationship, funds are settled via correspondent or intermediary banks. There can be up to three of these third party banks that facilitate the actual settlement of funds. The smaller and less internationally connected the sending and beneficiary banks are, the more banks they need to facilitate international wire settlements.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Correspondent banks are also needed when settling in different currencies. If we look at SVB’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">incoming wire instruction page</a> again, we see that depending on the currency of the wire, SVB will use a different corresponding bank. When wiring Chinese Yuan to an SVB account, SVB instructs that the wire should use Standard Chartered in Hong Kong as a correspondent bank. When wiring Euros to SVB, the instruction is to use Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt as a correspondent bank. The number of banks involved is also a factor in wire payment cost. The number of banks involved is also a factor in how fast the beneficiary is credited into their account.<br></p><div><p>International wire transfers are a huge component of money transfers across borders. SWIFT codes are a reliable and internationally standard way to direct the correct payments to the correct destinations.</p></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Want more ways to manage and wire money internationally with ease? <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/product-demo" target="_blank">Reach out to Modern Treasury for a demo.</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

		<p><em>This is a guest blogpost by GPT-3, the new AI software from OpenAI. We only gave it the title and "Repl.it" and it generated the following post for us</em></p>
<p>For a while, I wondered why it's so hard to share code. Surely sharing webpages is easy, since you can link to them with a URL. But webpages are static. They're basically just text files. Their content never changes, so there's no reason to try to sync it.</p>
<p>What changed my mind was the birth of "repl" programming. With repl, you type your program into a text box, press a button, and it runs immediately. A second text box shows its output.</p>
<p>Repl turns programming into an activity like writing prose, in which you revise continuously, as many times as you like, and always with access to the latest version.</p>
<p>I used to write my first drafts on paper, and then rewrite them in Word, or Google Docs. But repl turns code into the equivalent of a first draft.</p>
<p>At first, repl was strictly for "quick-and-dirty" programming. But now that it's become popular, more and more people use it for serious coding. And repl is inherently more social than code sharing has ever been. Even if you're the only person in the world working on a particular program, you can invite your friends to code with you by sharing your repl, and anyone can see the source code.</p>
<p>So repl begets social programming. With repl, the distinction between "working alone" and "working together" starts to fade away.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I rarely save my code in private. My drafts are in repl. I invite my friends to look at it. I post it to Twitter. Then, if someone finds a bug, or suggests a feature, or starts contributing, we don't have to switch to a proprietary code-sharing service like Github or even Google Docs. We just keep coding in repl.</p>
<p>Shareable computing is going to radically reshape the world of programming, and of course it will spread beyond programming into all kinds of creative collaboration.</p>
<p>Among other things, it's going to move more and more code out of private, and onto the public web. And that will bring an end to the walled garden of Apple's App Store and Google Play. It will make app stores irrelevant, and it will put paid to the whole idea of a "walled garden".</p>
<p>One way to visualize this is that repl will move us from a stack model to a network model. In the stack model, we write code in private and then, if it becomes popular, we launch it with an app store. In the network model, we share code in public and we find other people to work on it in public.</p>
<p>As repl-based social programming replaces private code sharing, it will also, incidentally, make much of our internet architecture – things like Domain Name Service and web hosting – obsolete. Repl, after all, doesn't need DNS. And it doesn't need to upload to any particular website. The whole idea of a website becomes redundant, because a repl can show you the output of any repl anywhere.</p>
<p>Repl is going to rewrite all the rules of software development. It will allow us to code together more easily. It will make code more durable and less easily deleted. And it will make the very idea of "walled gardens" or "app stores" seem ridiculous.</p>

<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>I’ve been spending time with Go for fun these past few months. I’ll give you an introduction to Google’s favorite language. I liked it a lot for many reasons and today I’ll tell you about it for 5 minutes.</p>



<h3>Hey! Ho! Let’s Go!</h3>



<p>Yes. All the headings are a pun with Go in this article. It’s not funny, but it gives me pleasure.</p>



<p>In 2007 <strong>none of the existing languages were good enough for the problems Google was experiencing</strong>. Three of their employees, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ken Thompson</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Pike</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/robert_griesemer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Griesemer</a>, reserved a small and quiet room in Google’s offices to discuss the issue. And to solve Google’s problems, they just decided to create a new language. </p>



<p>With their monster experience in IT, you can imagine that they did something clean. Because yes, these guys are not interns. They helped create the C language, Unix and UTF8. They know what they are doing.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dg8PHQF.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Dg8PHQF.png" alt="go"></figure>



<p>They wanted three main things for this new language : </p>



<ul><li>extremely fast compilation</li><li>efficient execution</li><li>very easy to use language.</li></ul>



<p>For them, C++ is awesome on the runtime side, but complex to use and with too much compilation time. Java does better on the compilation side, but still too complex to use. Python is easy to use, but not fast enough. </p>



<p><strong>All languages have a big flaw for our three legends</strong>. Go was imagined to solve all three problems at the same time.</p>



<h3><strong>Gotta Go fast</strong></h3>



<p>In 2009 the language is <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly announced</a> and in 2012 a first release lands on the Internet. And the promise is kept.</p>



<p>Go is <strong>a compiled and strongly typed programming language</strong>. Syntactically, it looks almost like C. Compilation allows for the best possible performance, but wastes developers’ time. Not with Go. <strong>Compilation is almost instantaneous.</strong> So you have the discipline and speed of a compiled language with the iteration speed of an interpreted language.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/WGcIAKr.gif" alt="golang"></figure>



<p>After compilation <strong>Go will generate a single file</strong>. This file contains all your code and can be used as is. It makes deployments much simpler. Also <strong>Go is a multiparadigm language</strong>. You can do procedural and/or object oriented. Object oriented is <strong>weird and very limited</strong>, we’ll come back to that.</p>



<p><strong>Go also comes with a garbage collector</strong> which again takes away complexity for the developer. Go also makes it easier to <strong>manage concurrency with its Go-routines</strong>.</p>



<iframe width="100%" height="529px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQ7STILAS0M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy">
</iframe>



<p>Finally Go has limited features and a limited way of doing things. It may seem like a drawback, but it’s what the creators wanted. Everybody works the same way with Go since the possibilities are reduced. <strong>The goal is that no one is lost when they come across a code they don’t know. </strong>Rob Pike explains this point better than me in this video just above.</p>



<h3>Good to Go</h3>



<p>For your very first introduction, I’ll show you some code from the official go website. I will modify it a lot to show you several concepts at the same time and go faster.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}</pre>



<p>Hello World. Each program is composed of package and execution starts in the main package. Other Go packages can be imported using “import”. Here we import fmt which will allow us to print hello world in the main() execution function.<strong> Pretty simple right ?</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	var i, j int = 10, 2
	fmt.Println(add(i, j))
}
</pre>



<p>Now, we add a function and as you can see it is strongly typed. The x and y parameters of the add function are int typed and the return of the function must also be typed.</p>



<p>Then, in the main function, two variables are created and initialized directly. The result of the first function is then displayed via fmt. Note that if I had not used variables i and j the Go compiler would have insulted me immediately.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fPflaRY.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/fPflaRY.jpg" alt="go"></figure>



<p>Like I said before, object-oriented is weird with Go. There’s no class, but methods on type. <strong>Interfaces are implicitly implemented.</strong> There is no implement keyword, it’s really confusing, let’s have a closer look.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

type Developer interface {
    Code() string
}

type GoDeveloper struct {
}

func (g GoDeveloper ) Code() string {
    return "Go code"
}

func main() {
    var goDeveloper Developer = &amp;GoDeveloper{}
    fmt.Println(goDeveloper.Code())
}</pre>



<p>Anyway, let’s take a look at what a Go-routine looks like.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	// go-routine is here with go keyword
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
</pre>



<p>Even if the concept exists in other languages, Go-routines are one of the key features of Go. They are functions that can be launched in concurrency with other functions. <strong>They are similar to threads but are extremely cheap to use !</strong> Go-routines communicate with each other using <a href="https://golangbot.com/channels/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">channels</a>. If you want to see more code to get a better feel for it <a href="https://gobyexample.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">this site</a> is just perfect.</p>



<h3>Go Everywhere</h3>



<p>People often use the name Golang to talk about Go. This name simply comes from the official website <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">golang.com</a>. The domain <a href="http://go.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">go.com</a> is already taken by a Disney site. <strong>Google had no choice and now the name Golang is everywhere</strong>. Note that Google supports Golang but the language remains open source.</p>

<p>At least that didn’t stop the whole world from using Golang. Of course, you have Google using it everywhere. Docker is completely written in Golang. <strong>It’s used in production at Amazon, IBM, Netflix, Facebook and even DigitalOcean.</strong> And it’s been around for more than 10 years now, so the ecosystem had time to develop.</p>



<h3>Should i Go ?</h3>



<p>On the adaption side, Go developers continue their slow rise over the last 10 years, reaching the <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pushes/2019/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 10 of popularity on GitHub</a>. However, <strong>it is not used that much in companies</strong>. It only reaches <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 12th position</a> in the latest StackOverFlow survey. That said, it is in the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-wanted" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 3 most wanted languages</a> by developers.</p>



<p>Personally I love Go. I haven’t encountered any of the language’s problems that are present. I continue to have fun with it, but I don’t see myself completely switching from  NodeJS at home. </p>



<p>I love NodeJS too much to do that. However, my plan for the future is to make <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebAssembly modules in Go</a> and call them via import when they are <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_experimental_wasm_modules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merged stable everywhere</a>! </p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/X7P8HDPtKHRdSJOewu/giphy.gif" alt="go"></figure></div>



<p>Should you drop everything and use Go because it’s the future? No. No language is the future. The future will always be composed of many languages. <strong>But if you want to test a very simple and powerful tool for your backend : it’s really interesting.</strong> I strongly advise you to do at least <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official interactive tour to make your own opinion</a>.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>They are currently <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incrementing Golang version 1</a> (now in 1.14) with new features. In the official blog they talk about <a href="https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrading to version 2 around version 1.20</a>. I can’t wait to see what will become of the language and its adoption by then.</p>

Finding needed solutions won’t be easy and will require creative thinking, robust analysis, and political resolve. The good news is that these challenges also present opportunities, particularly in terms of the economic development and job creation associated with decarbonizing America’s economy. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595934832085_15965"><p>Based on an extensive industrial and engineering analysis, our new report demonstrates that an aggressive national commitment to electrify all aspects of our economy would create up to 25 million good-paying American jobs over the next 15 years and  5 million sustained jobs by mid-century. This is the first analysis of the job opportunities  that would result from a rapid and total decarbonization of the economy as a whole. Unlike other approaches, which tend to see climate change policy as primarily environmental in nature, the study also imagines the electrification of America as fundamentally infrastructure designed to power America and its economy in the 21st century.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595931227322_5243"><div><h3>What others are saying about the report:</h3><p><em>"This important study shows that climate action can create millions of well-paying American jobs. Decarbonization is an unprecedented opportunity to mobilize American industry and grow our economy. We just need the political courage to seize it." </em><strong><em>Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI)</em></strong></p><p><em>"Climate change is an existential threat to our health and communities..&nbsp; Rewiring America provides a blueprint for reducing climate change pollution and creating good-paying jobs. It is an important contribution to the work we urgently need to be doing." </em><strong><em>Carol Browner, former EPA Administrator</em></strong></p><p><em>"Rewiring America asks the bold question of what it would mean if we made building a clean economy, as fast as possible, our national project. The results should surprise, provoke, and inspire."&nbsp; </em><strong><em>Joseph Majkut, Director of Climate Policy, Niskanen Center</em></strong></p><p><em>“For so long we’ve been sold the lie that we have to choose between good jobs and a safe environment, that our generation has to choose between a livable planet and a thriving, equitable economy. The Rewiring America Plan puts that lie to rest once and for all. This report is a critical contribution that shows that urgently achieving an all-society clean energy future by 2035 is not only necessary and achievable, but will make the world that young people inherit more prosperous. We can achieve a just transition to a better world out of the wreckage of this economic crisis, with good union jobs for all, including low-income communities and communities of color — the only thing standing in the way is political will.” </em><strong><em>Varshini Prakash, Co-founder and Executive Director, Sunrise Movement</em></strong></p><p><em>“The Rewiring America team asked the question: ‘What would happen if we actually tried to transition all of the infrastructure in American society over the next 15 years to stay within the 1.5ºC safe upper limit of global warming?’ The answer they found is that would save consumers and society money, and it would create lots and lots and lots of jobs — around 25 million of them.” </em><strong><em>Evan Weber, Co-Founder and Political Director, Sunrise Movement</em></strong></p><p><em>"As millions of people around the country are out of work, the question is: how do we rebuild?&nbsp; Rewiring Electricity shows a bold vision, and a great opportunity for labor across the country.&nbsp; Building a plan from the bottom up is exactly the way to go.&nbsp; This white paper shows that millions of jobs can be created with good, sustainable wages in every community in America." </em><strong><em>Mike Fishman, past Secretary Treasurer, Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and President, Clean Jobs New York</em></strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592581000788_5800"><div><h3>Author Bios</h3><p><strong>Saul Griffith </strong>is an engineer and inventor.

		<p>Wireheads are beings who have changed their reward architecture in order to&nbsp;be happy all the time. Unfortunately few people are making a serious effort to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/" target="_blank">steel man</a> the <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/wirehead/index.html" target="_blank">case for wireheading</a>.&nbsp;The concept of wireheading tends to be&nbsp;a conversation stopper, and is frequently used as a reductio-ad-absurdum for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.valence-utilitarianism.com/" target="_blank">valence utilitarianism</a>. Hedonism is a low-status philosophy at the time, but this may be the result of&nbsp;what amounts to&nbsp;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/">dumb reasons</a>&nbsp;(i.e. going against&nbsp;it signals&nbsp;intellectual sophistications). Let’s be meta-contrarian for a moment&nbsp;and think&nbsp;critically about it. What would a good case for wireheading look like? In what follows I will (1) provide an account of what is known about emotional&nbsp;dynamics over time, (2) discuss the known pitfalls of current wireheading methods, (3) propose a system&nbsp;to overcome these pitfalls, and (4) make the case that combining wireheading (done right) with a systematic exploration of the state-space of consciousness&nbsp;might&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;be our saving grace against the perils of Darwinism at the evolutionary limit.</p>
<p>Let us begin by enriching our understanding&nbsp;of the nature of bliss and its temporal dynamics:</p>
<h2>The Cube of Euphoria</h2>
<p>A little over a year ago I conducted a study to figure out the main dimensions along which psychotropic&nbsp;drugs influence people. The&nbsp;<a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/" target="_blank">State-Space of Drug Effects</a>&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;six main dimensions: fast euphoria, slow euphoria, spiritual euphoria, clarity, perception of overall value, and external vs. internal source of interest. The first three&nbsp;dimensions are directly related to pleasure, which makes them relevant for our&nbsp;current discussion.</p>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>
<h2>A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities</h2>
<p>Back between 2012 to&nbsp;2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion transitions. I did this first&nbsp;as part of a research project&nbsp;for a company I worked for&nbsp;(thanks Kanjoya!) and it&nbsp;then transformed into the topic of&nbsp;my masters’ thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some more&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers/conditioned-sentiment-expression.pdf" target="_blank">on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;I wrote with colleagues</a>&nbsp;on predicting future emotions based on a sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Can a human be happy all the time?</p>

<p>Let me clarify; I don’t mean “happiness” in any kind of complex sense. I don’t mean wellbeing or eudaimonia or life satisfaction or anything like that.  I mean <em>being in a good mood</em> – better than good, “high”, bubbly, enthusiastic.</p>

<p>In the psychiatry literature they call this state “euphoria” or “elation.”  It can be produced by recreational drugs, or by placing electrodes in some locations in the brain, or by some brain injuries, or by neurological or psychiatric disorders.  It is common in manic and hypomanic episodes.  And, of course, it is a normal mood that healthy sober people can enter as well.</p>

<p>But most euphoric states are transient, and most ways to deliberately induce euphoria don’t work. Morphine, for instance, can produce euphoria, but not continuously for months at a time; you develop tolerance for the drug until the euphoria-producing dose and the fatal dose intersect.  And people who have a stroke of good fortune like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#Happiness_set_point">winning the lottery</a> don’t stay euphoric forever – they initially feel great but then <em>adapt</em> to their changed circumstances.</p>

<p>So, you might ask, is there some kind of negative feedback loop in the brain such that euphoria is <em>always</em> temporary?  Is it literally impossible to feel awesome all the time, for months or years at a stretch?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no.</p>

<p>There is something called chronic mania, which is just what it sounds like: a manic state, including euphoria/elation, which lasts for over 6 months, sometimes forever.</p>

<p>The nineteenth-century psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin was the first to give a clinical description of chronic mania, though some modern neurologists think that today those patients would be diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia[1], and in his day, chronic mania was the second most common reason for a patient to be committed to a mental hospital.[2]</p>

<p>Apart from the length of their episodes, chronic mania patients differ from bipolar patients in a few systematic ways.  Chronic mania generally doesn’t alternate with depression, and is more likely than bipolar mania to come with an “elated mood.”  Chronic mania, compared to bipolar mania, is more likely to come with delusions, especially delusions of grandeur, while bipolar mania is more likely to come with symptoms of psychomotor agitation like tension, pressured speech, loss of sleep, and elevated sex drive.[2] Chronic mania is more likely to begin after age 40.[3]</p>

<p>The typical pattern, from case studies, seems to be of a person who may have had transient manic episodes in the past, “settling into” a chronic manic state where they are generally euphoric but out of touch with reality, engaging in reckless, inappropriate, or obnoxious behavior, until they come to the attention of psychiatrists when neighbors or relatives bring them to the hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>

<p>Kraepelin commented on the behavioral disinhibition and poor impulse control of chronic mania patients:</p>

<p>“Only the coarser enjoyments, eating, drinking, smoking, snuffing, still arouse in them vivid feelings, further the satisfaction of their personal wishes and wants…[they] talk more than their share, swagger, try to gain for themselves all possible little advantage.”[1]</p>

<p>He also notes that they engage in hoarding behavior:</p>

<p>“They collect all possible rubbish in their pockets, make a mess with it all round about, rub and wipe things, adorn themselves with rags and scraps of ribbon.”[1]</p>

<p>Frederic Wertham, a psychiatrist writing in 1929, described cases of chronic mania that fit the overall pattern.[4]  In all seven cases, the chronic mania began after age 30 (later than the typical onset of bipolar disorder), and in all cases it lasted several years.  In several cases, the patients had previously had briefer manic episodes.</p>

<p>Wertham describes traits such as “pressure of activity, great sociability, lack of fatigue, good humor”, “noisiness and talkativeness”, “buoyant” and “elated” moods, “wild schemes” and delusions (of unrealistic business deals, religious revelations, million-dollar inheritances),  “joviality and playfulness with jokes and laughing”, “vulgar and profane” language and sexual advances towards nurses.</p>

<p>Like Kraepelin’s patients, one of Wertham’s patients collects useless items and decorates herself – she “wore flowers in her hair and bits of colored wool tied to her buttons…continued decorating herself with little objects.”</p>

<p>Wertham notes some patterns: chronic mania patients tend to be middle-aged at onset, tend to have highly sociable and active personalities even before their illness, have no sign of cognitive decline (as you’d expect in dementia), and tend to be heavyset.</p>

<p>Similar features show up in more recent case studies of chronic mania: older age, hoarding, delusions, disinhibited behavior.</p>

<p>One 68-year-old woman[5] had been in an “elevated mood” state for 30 years, during which she increasingly hoarded objects and lived in increasing squalor, refusing all help. She had no sign of dementia or memory loss when tested, and no history of drug abuse. Prior to her illness she had had one depressive episode after the death of her husband, and before that she had been a “rather jovial schoolmistress” – like Wertham’s patients, her baseline personality was cheerful.  She recovered after treatment with lithium.</p>

<p>A 65-year-old Indian man had been manic for 48 years,[6] with the onset beginning after a fever at age 12.  He was “cheerful, optimistic, talkative, outgoing, and overly confident,” and became involved in politics with some success. But he also engaged in reckless behavior, traveling by train across India without paying his fare, stealing objects and giving them away to the poor. He “would often describe himself as a messenger of God with special powers, stating God had created him for the welfare of poor people”.  He couldn’t hold down a job and he was divorced twice, but his mood was “persistently cheerful or irritable.”  He was eventually hospitalized due to complaints by neighbors and relatives, and recovered after a temporary course of treatment with antipsychotics.</p>

<p>A 33-year-old woman who had been manic for 17 years[7] “expressed grandiose beliefs and evidenced a euphoric mood”, and had been unable to keep a job due to her “over-familiar” behavior.  She had never abused drugs.  “Her parents described her premorbid personality as generally affable, co-operative and creative but occasionally forceful and stubborn.”</p>

<p><strong>Chronic Mania and Brain Damage</strong></p>

<p>A variety of case studies of chronic mania identified a neurological cause.</p>

<p>One young woman who had mania-like symptoms since childhood (behavior problems, restlessness, talkativeness, labile and disinhibited mood, sexually provocative behavior starting at adolescence) was found upon radiological examination to have severe degeneration of the cerebellum.[8]</p>

<p>Another patient, a young man who had been electrocuted by getting entangled with a wire two years previously, developed manic symptoms of grandiose and persecutory delusions, hallucinations, poor judgment, and increased appetite.[9]</p>

<p>A 55-year-old man who had become irritable, extremely sociable, and extravagant with money was found to have an oligodendroglioma, a large brain tumor in the left temporoparietal lobe, and his symptoms improved after surgery.[10]</p>

<p>An eight-year-old child who had been ill with polioencephalomyelitis had a marked personality change – “he started talking excessively, singing songs and dancing. The symptoms became worse once he came home. He started talking with relatives, neighbours and strangers, content of talk was how he would act in a movie, how he would build a big house, that he would marry a beautiful lady, etc. He was singing film songs, was going out of the house and it used to be very difficult to locate and bring him back. His appetite was increased, sleep was disturbed. Majority of the time, he was very happy and cheerful.”[11]</p>

<p>A patient with a stroke damaging the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus was reported to have developed “persistent euphoria”, while in another case of brain surgery on the hypothalamus, “every time the surgeon gently wiped coagulated blood from the ventricle floor the patient burst out laughing, whistled, made jokes, and uttered obscene remarks.”[12]</p>

<p>An 81-year-old woman with a stroke in the right thalamus “became increasingly euphoric and talkative, and had grandiose delusions…believed that her health was better than ever and joked inappropriately. She also reported a decreased need for sleep.” After treatment with a temporary course of antipsychotics, she recovered but was still “mildly euthymic.”[13]</p>

<p>Out  of 66 consecutive patients treated for head trauma, 6 (9%) developed mania[14]. The only lesion location significantly associated with mania was the temporal pole (p = 0.0005), which is also one of the first areas damaged in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Compared to patients who developed bipolar disorder after brain injury, patients who developed only mania after brain injury were significantly more likely to have cortical lesions (esp. the orbitofrontal cortex and the right basotemporal cortex.)[15]</p>

<p>Another study found that mania after brain injury was “was associated primarily with orbitofrontal, thatamic, caudate, and basotemporal lesions in the right hemisphere.”[16]</p>

<p>The most common locations of lesions for patients with post-stroke mania (out of 74 cases) are the right frontal lobe and basal ganglia. Out of 16 patients who developed mania after a brain tumor, the tumor was in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, or subcortical limbic structure in 13 patients, and two patients (12.5%) had chronic mania.  [17]</p>

<p>One of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis is reported to be euphoria, or “euphoria sclerotica”, an unusual cheerfulness, optimism, and lack of awareness of their physical disability.</p>

<p>In a study of 44 MS patients and 22 healthy controls, 13% of MS patients had euphoria and 13% had …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article itemref="hero-page-title" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In the last few weeks, people across the U.S. have been receiving unexpected packages of peas in their mail. News of these mysterious shipments circulated with theories ranging from accidental shipment to agricultural sabotage – the real reason though is tied to product review fraud. In this post, we’ll share what we have learned about this growing problem and discuss tools to help you filter out the fakes.</p>
<p>Product reviews are an invaluable shopping tool, but one that can’t be trusted blindly. Immoral sellers are increasingly introducing fake reviews to their products to deceive shoppers. It’s not just about the fake reviews though – these sellers also use increased review volume to boost their product’s ranking. </p>
<h2>Brushing</h2>
<p>Brushing is a method used to post fake reviews. It’s not a complicated concept, but affords sellers a way to post fraudulent reviews by using someones home address to send their product or a cheap substitute. Most recently, sellers sent peas but these were likely just substitutes used to make a transaction look legitimate so they can post fake reviews for one of their products. Here’s a quick video, from KCEN news, covering this event and talking briefly about brushing:</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Why is China sending packages of seeds?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dIwvCppr3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>
<h2>Fake Reviews Impact</h2>
<p>As you can see, this isn’t a new problem, but is one that continues to grow. It appears that those most susceptible to becoming the recipients of these items are those who have shopped with Chinese based retailers. If you are selected as the recipient for products associated with this scam, it is recommended you change all of your passwords with retailers and report it – feel free to keep the items. </p>
<p>It’s still concerning though because some stranger is using your home address and potentially your name and/or account to deceive shoppers into purchasing their product. On top of that, you have no control over what they send to your mailbox. You don’t know the source of the product or whether or not it is safe to use. </p>
<h2>Other Methods Used</h2>
<p>Sellers will also pay people directly the cost of their product plus a fee to post false reviews using accounts the poster controls. These types of services are widely available and cost next to nothing for the seller as they ultimately serve as both the seller and buyer. </p>
<p>Going a step further and to corroborate reviews, unscrupulous sellers will setup comparison websites with fake reviews pushing their products and services. This is especially rampant in high-paying affiliate markets. </p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Separating real and fake reviews is nearly impossible. Luckily there are some tools that can help you filter out the fakes – the best we found is from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reviewmeta.com/" target="_blank">Reviewmeta</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fakespot.com/" target="_blank">Fakespot</a>. Both are free and easy to use – just enter the URL of the product. They also offer browser add-ons so you can conveniently check the authenticity of a products reviews as you shop. We don’t like to install add-ons so we just stick to their site. </p>
<p>Here is a brief video for Reviewmeta:</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these are not perfect solutions, but they do give you some weapons in the fight against fake products reviews.</p>
<h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
<p>The volume of fake reviews and product descriptions is difficult to grasp. One of the major reasons we started this site is to combat these predatory practices by sharing first-hand product knowledge. To minimize your risk of falling victim to false reviews, we recommend that you remain skeptical of online reviews, use different review sources to look for discrepancies, and use the tools discussed in this post for trustworthy product insights. There really is no single solution to avoid deceitful reviews, but armed with these tools and knowledge may help you avoid a costly mistake.</p>
<p>As always, we are happy to answer any questions you may have. Safe shopping. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Ready for a new series?</p>

<p>Having just gone over a bunch of items regarding <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2013/08/readability-series-wrap-up.html">code readability</a>, it is time to shift gears and get into the topic of the design of Command Line Interfaces (or CLIs for short).</p>

<p>The main focus of this series will be to cover best practices involved in creating applications whose interface is command-line oriented. Among other things, I will detail how the CLI should accept optional and required arguments, how a tool should expose more than one action and how interactive help should be handled.</p>

<p>Please note that console applications that use “drawing” libraries like <code>curses</code> are out of scope in these series: these applications follow to some extent the same principles as GUI-based applications, with the only difference being that their rendering happens in text mode. Therefore, the guidelines for their design are completely different and I don’t have enough experience to comment on them.</p>

<p>And now, a little disclaimer: I am well aware that the articles on this topic can be controversial: there are several different ways to design a CLI just as there are a million ways to design a GUI or a web page. So… just keep in mind that what I will be describing here are my own recollection of thoughts after having had to deal with tons of command line utilities and being annoyed by their inconsistencies and surprising behaviors — all caused by each tool implementing its own style for no real reason.</p>

<p>Hope that you agree, at least, on a few points ;-)</p>

targeting TI graphing calculators (currently only the 83+, but maybe others
later). There’s rather a lot to say about it, but here I will discuss the
<a href="#motivation">motivation for a new emulator</a> and <a href="#the-state-of-the-art">the state of
the art</a> followed by technical notes on
the <a href="#design">design</a> and <a href="#implementation">initial development process</a>.</p><figure><picture>

homepage</a></strong> on GitLab which has a <strong>live
demo</strong> that runs in your web browser and other resources including
source code.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>I’ve long been involved in the community of people who program for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series">TI-83+ series of graphing calculators</a>; it was on that platform that I got started programming in the first place. These days I play more of an advisory than active role in writing programs, by running much of <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/">Cemetech</a> behind the scenes and providing the occasional input to others. I think calculators are an excellent way to introduce people to programming, since they are readily available devices and not too complex to get started on, while still having enough capability to support experienced developers in doing interesting things (because they are readily accessible embedded systems). I fully credit getting started with programming calculators for having ended up programming embedded systems profesionally.</p><figure><img src="https://www.taricorp.net/2020/introducing-tihle/calcdcc.jpg" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tim's workspace for
<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=262170#262170">CalcDCC</a>
looks like it could contain any embedded engineer's prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the future of programming for TI calculators seems to be in peril. About a month ago, the news came out that new versions of the OS for the TI-84+ CE (the most recent variant of the 83+ featuring a color screen and improved eZ80 processor) <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/949/_/ti-removes-asmc-programming-from-ti-83-premium-ce">will remove support for running native code</a>.</p><h3 id="death-of-a-platform">Death of a platform</h3><p>While this doesn’t necessarily affect older calculators or programs, in the long
term it seems to spell doom for calculators as an inroad to developing embedded
software in particular. Programs written in the calculators’ dialect of BASIC
continue to be accessible and a new Python implementation fills the void
somewhat, but they lack in depth- where a user could spend time and effort
developing native programs constrained only by the hardware they run on before, in
the future users will be <strong>limited to only those capabilities provided by TI’s
software</strong>.</p><p>In much the same way that I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> is a decent introduction to programming but completely hides interesting details and is not seriously used by anybody but those using it a learning tool, I also believe removal of support for running native code will ultimately mean people will no longer have calculators (which are often required school equipment!) as a useful entrypoint to serious programming.</p><h3 id="historical-interest">Historical interest</h3><p>In addition to the loss of a way to introduce people to programming, removing support for native code also effectively throws away a large existing library of programs that stretches back more than 20 years (nicely embodied in <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</a>, which first came online in 1996). While the 84+ CE is a young platform relative to the TI-83+ series as a whole (and is incompatible with earlier software), it already has a rich library of programs created by users that will effectively be lost when they can no longer be run on the hardware they are designed for.</p><figure><picture>

<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1347">Tetric A</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The precedent of effectively <strong>destroying the work of community members</strong> is
troubling, and I am motivated to look for ways to preserve it. In much the same
way that there still exist thriving communities around long-obsolete home
computers like the <a href="https://apple2online.com/">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://thec64community.online/">Commodore
64</a> today, I think it’s worthwhile to try to
provide a similar opportunity by preserving the platform into a hostile future
by working to give the systems and software ongoing life beyond what their
creators envisioned (or perhaps more pointedly, beyond what they decided they
could make money from).</p><p>As a newer platform than those early home computers that still have active communities, information and resources may be rather easier to come by for these calculators because much of the information was born digital and has always been online. However this is also hazardous to preservation, because if items are readily available online there may not be any replacements available if the original goes away. For instance, TI used to <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/1/19/19421.html">freely provide an SDK for the 83+</a>, but have more recently made it <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/customer-support/sdk-request">much more difficult to access</a>. Perhaps even more concerningly, TI’s web site no longer seems to provide <em>any</em> information about the <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-84plus-cse.html">TI-84+ CSE</a>, seeming to deny that it ever existed (though manuals and software are still available if you know where to look).</p><h3 id="a-calling">A calling</h3><p>Recognizing these concerns about the loss of a valuable resource for beginning programmers and loss of interesting history to the grind of the education-industrial complex,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> what are we to do?</p><p>There exist a number of web sites that document the calculators and offer
resources related to them- I’m already involved in that, which is valuable and
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ticalc-2014-08">generally well-preserved</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/">the
Internet Archive</a>. But if the existing resources are
useless on current hardware as they largely become when large classes of
programs are not runnable, new tools become required: I believe this situation
calls for emulation of the calculators, to <strong>make the platform accessible to
everybody</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The state of the art</h2><p>There already exist a number of emulators for TI calculators, including:</p><ul><li><a href="http://wabbitemu.org/">WabbitEmu</a>, which is open-source and generally good
quality.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/">jsTIfied</a>, an emulator
available as a web application.</li><li><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html">Virtual TI</a>,
one of the earliest calculator emulators to be created.</li><li><a href="https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Emulators:PindurTI">PindurTI</a>,
which is now defunct but offered some useful capabilities in its day.</li><li>..and others</li></ul><p>While most of these are accurate enough to run most programs, this is not the
whole story: all of them <strong>require a ROM image to work</strong>. The ROM includes the
calculator’s operating system and boot code, which implement huge swaths of
functionality from keyboard and display handling through implementing
floating-point arithmetic and the TI-BASIC interpreter.</p><p>TI jealously protect their OS and boot code because from the point of view of
their business, the entire value of the calculator is in its software. If an
emulator can run the same software on a more general machine, what reason is
there for a user to purchase a $100 device from TI?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But if we want
to preserve <em>community</em> software for emulation, we don’t really care about the
same functions that TI are interested in protecting.</p><p>Though truly accurate emulation still requires all OS functions be available in
the same way, many applications only use a small subset of them. So what options
are available for emulating the system software?</p><h3 id="os-implementations">OS implementations</h3><ul><li>TI’s EOS (TI-OS) is provided with the calculator, and can be downloaded
from TI in order to update a calculator. However, they added a <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8819">clickwrap
agreement to the OS in
2013</a> that attempts
to forbid use of the OS for emulation. While that clause is questionably
enforceable, nobody (myself included) is very interested in challenging it-
mostly because TI has historically tended to turn a blind eye to the
distribution of ROMs. Any such distribution in a larger, more public forum
increases the risk of calling in the lawyers, so for these and the reasons
discussed above, I do not believe it is tenable to use TI’s OS for
general-availability emulation.</li><li>Brandon Wilson’s <a href="https://www.brandonw.net/calculators/OS2/">OS2</a> seems most
relevant, in that it wants to reimplement TI-OS “but better.” However,
it hasn’t been updated in 11 years at this point and seems dead. It’s also
dependent on the assembler and tools provided by Zilog, which only run on
Windows and are closed-source.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5686">GlassOS</a>
is implemented in C and actually seems useable, but lacks compatibility
with any existing software.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/KnightOS/KnightOS">KnightOS</a> is UNIX-like and seems to
have a selection of useful software, but again is not compatible with any
existing software beyond a small library of ports targeting it.</li><li>Many other people (myself included) have attempted to write OSes, but they

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Are you confused about what to learn when it comes to the fundamentals of programming? Do you constantly get told that algorithms and data structures are the gold standard for what will help propel your understanding? How do you get better at designing solutions rather than operating preexisting ones?</p>
<p>Most of what people try to shill as fundamentals does not end up empowering people with a framework around problem solving. People assume that instead of having the ability to solve problems themselves, they instead need to learn a grab-bag of tool-oriented prior knowledge. This taints one's arc of learning with the idea that it is all about gobbling up technical arcana, all the while reliant on others to find just which mystery to focus on next.</p>
<p>Mathematics and systems thinking has helps me build mental models of almost everything around me, aiding me in how I navigate the world and make decisions. You are likely carrying around <em>lots</em> of mental models with you already. Strong mental models that refine over time give you the ability to understand different programming languages without having to read entire books, immerse yourself in new code you've never seen before without having to ask a number of it's inventors who may have left little to no documentation, or, perhaps, how to reason about a market you are creating as part of a business. <strong>Models describe the essence of these things; them being "mental" is merely a matter of keeping them in your head.</strong></p>
<p>Modeling is about describing systems. While a collection holds all the items contained, a system augments this with descriptions of how the items interrelate. <strong>At it's essence, a system is a collection of shapes, usually boxes or circles, representing distinct entities, and arrows describing the relationships between these entities.</strong> If you're mathematically inclined a system is a graph with nodes (the shapes) and edges (the arrows).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-pdp11.jpg" alt="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer" title="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer">
  
</figure>
<p>The shapes in the graph expressed should <strong>not</strong> be thought of as black boxes. Instead, <strong>think of a systems diagram as merely a view of the system at a particular scale.</strong> It is not that we should never see the details of the entities in the system, as the popular notions around encapsulation may lead us to think, but that we are simply ignoring them when discussing the system at this level of detail.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-555-timer.jpg" alt="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit" title="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit">
  
</figure>
<p>Systems that describe the flux of some unit, continuous or discrete, often refer to the unit flowing across the connections as a <strong>stock</strong>. <strong>Taps</strong> adjust the rate of flow of the stocks along the arrows. It's is a good practice to not overload the usage of what an arrow means by having it describe verbs <em>or</em> the inlet and outlet of stocks, but not both.</p>
<p>Systems inevitably end up describing repetitive actions, otherwise known as <strong>loops</strong>. A loop may consist of a way to communicate necessary changes to some other entity in the loop which we call <strong>feedback</strong>. A loop with finely-tuned feedback mechanism will seek some state of equilibrium while a loop whose feedback is disregarded or misaligned will self-reinforce in some general trend. If a stock is involved, you can see how producers and consumers are affecting the quantity of the stock in this system with a behavior-over-time graph.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-feedback-loops.jpg" alt="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5" title="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5">
  
</figure>
<p>When we talk about misalignment of feedback in loops, we tend to mean the amount of delay of some message or action. <strong>All loops have some delay in their communications</strong>, but the tuning of that delay is important. Given the context of the system or loop, a short delay may be just as bad as a long delay. A system describing the supply and demand of a widget may want a certain sized delay so that demands for manufacture do not lead to oversupply.</p>
<p>An example of a system seeking a state of equilibrium may be a thermostat connected to a heater. If the heater reaches a target point on the thermostat, the heater stops until the thermostat drops below the target point. If the thermostat didn't exist, there would be no feedback and the heater would continue to increase over time. If there was a substantial delay in the feedback of the thermostat to the unit that controls whether or not the heater is on, the heat would also continue to grow up until a point. If you include a cooling system, you may get finer control of both directions of temperature. It's worth mentioning that most systems of growth have a saturation point, but that point may be functionally quite high in the context of use!</p>

</figure>
<p>State machines also make up the basis of a system; the boxes are states, the arrows transitions between states, and the use of a state machine includes tracking the current state of where an agent in the state machine might be. This type of thinking is highly underappreciated when designing transactional systems such as network requests, payment flows, and so on. State machines help clarify if the flow of logic has any odd behavior, such as winding up in invalid states or transitions that lead to inescapable states.</p>

</figure>
<p>The best way to get better at systems thinking is to start drawing out systems diagrams. Drawing by hand in a journal is my preferred route, but there are also many services that make doing these easily. For example, here's an incredibly rough sketch of a diagram I copied from Richard Hamming's classic "The Art of Doing Science and Research" showing the essence of a CPU.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-cpu.jpg" alt="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering" title="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering">
  
</figure>
<p>It also helps to see other people building up systems, as I've included some examples here. Functional block diagrams are my favorite but if you see any type of graph you could, theoretically, coerce that into the idea of a system and think about its causal relationships, how time plays a part of the system and the states that it may be in, how the author of the diagram has chosen to render distinct parts of the system, or maybe combine both the flow of units <em>as well as</em> the actions between nodes and see how confusing that gets. There are lots of places like the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">Bitsavers</a> that have scanned copies of old computer reference manuals with plenty of circuit and functional block diagrams that are great places to start, and an article discussing architectural changes is worth it's weight in gold, <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/secondary-storage-to-just-storage/">like this one by Charity Majors</a>. <em>Don't worry about system diagrams being perfect; in the same way that writing can help you refine your thoughts, systems diagrams can help refine your thinking around a system.</em></p>

The business would be designed to tap into these “hidden sentiment indicators” in order to understand how people at work are being affected by their environments and situations.</p><p>One clear example of this I saw while browsing through the trending memes/gifs on Microsoft Teams on 6/5/2020 (this was at the apex of the Black Lives Matter protests that were sweeping across the United States as executives and individuals from around the world spoke out against racial injustice). As you can see, most of the memes have to do with feeling love and solidarity, in spite of the turmoil in the world.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596044405768_23055"><div><p>For executives, developing a meme gauge (in other words, using the quality/quantity/content of sent memes to gauge emotions and sentiments of employees) could help to improve corporate culture and communication.

How do companies keep a pulse on individual sentiment and align that with all-up strategic goals while managing unique differences, perspectives, and opinions? It’s a problem that hasn’t been solved, but as people have more choices and less-ties to specific businesses and companies, culture will become a large selling point (or breaking factor) that makes or breaks a corporation.</p><p><strong>Monetization: </strong>Selling this service to corporations.</p><p><strong>Contributed by: </strong><a href="https://www.michaelbervell.com/">Michael Bervell</a> (Billion Dollar Startup Ideas)</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e458a53e1867d15f05c8"><div><p>With school starting right around the corner, many full-time working parents are at a loss of for what to do. They don’t feel comfortable with new social distancing policies. They may not like the way distance learning is being implemented at their school. If you’re wracking your brain trying to figure out how you’re possibly going to afford homeschooling or manage it with two full-time jobs, you are not alone.</p><p>What many families don’t realize is that homeschoolers are not rich typically  In fact, they are <a href="https://responsiblehomeschooling.org/research/summaries/homeschool-demographics/">just as likely to be poor or near poor than other families</a>. In fact, homeschoolers generally spend only <a href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/homeschooling-cost-home-school-curriculum-program-books/">$300-600/year</a> on curriculum.</p><p>For decades, homeschooling families have found creative ways to educate their children on a shoestring budget. We’ve talked to thousands of homeschooling families around the world about creative solutions they’ve found and are excited to share them with you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few ways that families can homeschool affordable.</strong></p><p><strong>1) Use free curriculum</strong></p><p>There are so many wonderful free resources available to homeschooling families. A great place to start for free curriculum is <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khanacademy">Khan Academy</a> for PreK-12th grade or <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khan-app-kids">Khan App Kids</a> for Prek-2nd. Khan Academy is a strengths-based program.&nbsp; This means that your child will get positive reinforcement for doing well, not penalized for weaknesses.&nbsp; It is also mastery-based, meaning children move ahead at their own rate.</p><p><strong>Some others we love that offer free or inexpensive options are:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://mysteryscience.com/">Mystery Science</a> for science</p></li><li><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mathtango/id1234698308">Math Tango</a> for rmath</p></li><li><p><a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> for coding&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duo Lingo</a> for foreign language</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/">Zinn Education Project</a> for US History</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/">Teach your Monster to Read</a> (for learning to read)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CosmicKidsYoga">Cosmic Kids Yoga</a> for movement</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub">Art Hub for Kids</a> for drawing and fine motor skills</p></li><li><p><a href="https://bravewriter.com/download-your-freewriting-lessons/">Brave Writer </a>for writing</p></li><li><p><a href="https://blossomandroot.com/">Blossom and Root</a> for a nature and art based curriculum</p></li><li><p><a href="https://schoolclosures.org/">Schoolclosures.org </a>offers free tutoring in every subject for all ages</p></li></ul><p><strong>Here is a more comprehensive list of </strong><a href="https://medium.com/@manisharoses/free-on-line-education-resources-for-parents-105c5520b262"><strong>free homeschooling resources curated by homeschool parents.&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p><strong>2) Solve for your childcare problem, not your education problem</strong></p><p>Education and childcare are inextricably linked, but when trying to find creative ways to budget for homeschooling, I find it helpful to focus on the childcare problem, rather than the  education one.  Homeschooling one on one is very different than learning in a classroom because children get individual attention from their parent or tutor and thus benefit from <a href="https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma/">mastery learning.</a> When learning happens through independent study or with a tutor, it happens much more quickly than in a classroom setting. This is why most homeschoolers only need 1-2 hours a day of parent-led instruction to optimize learning outcomes and meet or exceed state standards for learning. </p><p>Many of the curriculum available are designed to be easy to facilitate for a parent or a caregiver, so you don’t need to necessarily spend extra money on a professional teacher or tutor. Lastly, if you do need extra professional teaching support, many free tutoring platforms exist with exceptional teachers and grad students available to guide your child’s learning. </p><p>Often, parents can just set their children up to the day and they’re off to the races. And there are many great curriculum options available to support parents teaching their children in this way for the first time that require no prep or teaching experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it’s useful to think about <strong>how you managed childcare when your child was in preschool</strong> when school was not available to you<strong> </strong>and start thinking of creative solutions in that context.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few great ways to make childcare more affordable:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Ask a family member to watch your children: </strong>While this might seem drastic, having a family member live with you and take care of childcare is one of the easiest and most effective ways to get the job done. It’s very common in other cultures, but in the United States, we’re not accustomed as much for asking for this type of support from extended family.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Swap childcare with other families: </strong>Are there a few other families in your neighborhood who need childcare support? Consider creating a schedule where each family watches the kids one day a week or alternate half-days. Each family takes a morning or an afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask your company for support: </strong>During this time, it’s not unreasonable for parents to ask for special support from their companies to do the impossible (work full-time when schools are not providing childcare for kids). Ask your company for completely flexible hours. Ask them to make meetings optional. Ask them to give you a schedule where you do one 3 hour block of work a day.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Take advantage of free classes online: </strong>While the online experience has not been optimal for many students, there are definitely many teachers who are finding creative ways to build highly engaging online courses. The best place I’ve found for inexpensive or free classes for kids is <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/kids/">Eventbrite</a>. Here is a search I did for <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/kids/">free virtual classes for kids.&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Hire a sitter to homeschool your child: </strong>There are so many great secular, homeschool resources available that are easy for parents and caregivers to follow. You don’t need a professional teacher to guide your child’s learning and a caregiver can often be less expensive.&nbsp; You can also share a sitter with another family to reduce the price. During quarantine, families are also hiring virtual sitters to great success. The more interactive activities a sitter does with a child online (Art projects, movement, etc) the more likely they are to stay engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask a neighbor or friend to watch your child. </strong>You might be surprised by people’s generosity. Often older people in your community feel lonely and would be thrilled to spend time with a child. Likewise, many people are looking for ways to be helpful during the pandemic and helping others (like a working parent) helps them feel like they can make a difference.

    <h2>Data Fetching in React sucks.</h2><h4>You've likely tried countless "global state" libraries, <em>useFancyPromise</em> hooks and maybe even attempted to write your own solutions only to end up back in the same place: Writing TONS of code to handle seemingly endless data fetching scenarios. But WHY?</h4><h3>Server state and client state are fundamentally different.</h3><h4><span>Server state:</span></h4><ol><li>Is <strong>persisted remotely</strong> in a location <strong>you do not control</strong></li><li>Requires <strong>asynchronous APIs</strong> for fetching and updating</li><li>Implies shared ownership and <strong>can be changed by others without your knowledge</strong></li><li><em>Will eventually </em>become "stale" or "outdated" during the lifecycle of your app.</li></ol><h3>So, it's time we <em>stop trying to force</em> server-state into our client-state tools and instead, <strong>harness</strong> the power of its<em> unique </em>challenges for our benefit:</h3><ul><li><strong>Caching</strong>... (possibly the hardest thing to do in programming, but game-changing)</li><li><strong>Deduping</strong> multiple requests for the same data into a single request</li><li><strong>Updating</strong> out of date data <strong>in the background</strong></li><li>Controlling when data is "out of date"</li><li>Performance optimizations like <strong>pagination and lazy loading</strong> data</li><li>Managing <strong>memory and garbage collection</strong> of server state</li><li><strong>Optimistic updates and rollbacks</strong> for "instant" UI and user experiences.</li></ul><h2><strong>React Query</strong> turns these challenges into <em>powerful features</em>.</h2><h5>It is <em>the best tool available</em> for solving all of these issues <strong>out-of-the-box, with zero configuration, and allowing for fine-grained customization</strong> as your application grows<strong>.﻿</strong></h5>

  <p>One of the striking and sad things about the pandemic for me has been a disconnect between my own relatively uninterrupted experience and what I see as the broader, more traumatic experience. One of the key drivers of the more dramatic disparity is the technology that is being deployed in response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will suggest a framework for teasing out the distribution of relative winners and losers resulting from the adoption of new technology. Using this framework, I’ll argue that <strong>COVID is accelerating the “virtualization” of the economy and that the adoption of new technology and norms like remote work, Zoom meetings, and delivery commerce will drive lumpier (power) distributions of earnings.</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>While this essay focuses on disparity in economic consequences, I want to acknowledge the disparity in health consequences of COVID.</summary>
<div>
    <p>The early numbers confirm that the impacts of COVID-19 are indeed very different for different populations – <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html">this report from the CDC</a> estimates that the hospitalization rates are 4-5 times higher for Black, Hispanic, Latino, and American Indian people in the US vs whites:</p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-pretty-long-essay-so-here-is-the-tldr">This is a pretty long essay, so here is the tldr;</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We can extend the <em>“microphone or forklift?”</em> question from a 2007 Edward Leamer essay with a few more representative types – shipping container, video conferencing, stethoscope – to build a useful framework for thinking about the relative win/loss distributions of different kinds of new technology.</li>
  <li>As virtualization increases global competition for service work and knowledge work, the effects will mirror those of globalization, driving wages down by allowing jobs to move to geos / countries where labor is cheaper.</li>
  <li>As virtualization allows some local services to become “content,” the effects will mirror those of a “microphone technology,” resulting in superstar effects.</li>
  <li>Virtualization will benefit capital (owners of tech) and relatively favor labor in lower GDP countries / lower cost geos.</li>
  <li>One area where virtualization has the potential to create more jobs than it destroys is where it serves as a “stethoscope technology” that facilitates 1:1 listening.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="setup-forklifts-and-microphones">Setup: Forklifts and Microphones</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.45.1.83">2007 essay in the Journal of Economics Literature</a>, Edward Leamer asks the following question, which I think we can extend to build a framework that can help us understand the effects of any new type of technology (like virtualization).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is a computer more like a forklift or more like a microphone?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leamer goes on (<strong>emphasis</strong> mine, and I will quote at length rather than paraphrase):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t matter much who drives the forklift, but it matters a lot who sings into the microphone. Think about the forklift first. You might be a lot stronger than I, but with a little bit of training, I can operate a forklift and lift just as much as you or any other forklift operator. Thus <strong>the forklift is a force for income equality, eliminating your strength advantage over me</strong>….</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/forklifts-and-microphones/freddie.jpg"><figcaption>Freddie Mercury, via ngradio.gr</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The effect of the microphone and mass media have been to allow a single talented entertainer to serve a huge customer base and accordingly to command enormous earnings. This creates an earnings distribution with a few extremely highly paid talented and trained individuals</strong>….</p>

  <p><strong>A computer is both a forklift and a microphone.</strong> Clerks in McDonalds no longer have to be able to read or to compute…. That’s the forklift. It doesn’t much matter who punches the buttons. Thus your intelligence advantage over me is eliminated by the computer, just as your strength advantage was eliminated by the forklift. But for many other operations it matters enormously who types on the computer. One example is computer programming.
….
A talented architect with a computer assistant can serve a much enlarged customer base. A talented attorney, or a talented economist, or a talented radiologist with computer assistants can serve much enlarged customer bases. These talented individuals command high wages while the less talented struggle for customers.</p>

  <p>Computer technology seems therefore to be taking us into a future where there are a few very talented, very well-paid people and the rest of us are doing the mundane computer-assisted tasks which don’t require us to read, write, or even think very much. Just push the right button now and then.</p>

  <p>In other words, <strong>the information revolution may be a powerful force for income inequality</strong> by raising the compensation for natural talents and also the interaction between talent and training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let’s extend some of his examples and dig a bit more into who wins and loses relatively when technology like a forklift has an “equalizing” effect.</p>

<p>When Leamer talks about the equalizing effect of a forklift, he talks about it as a sort of closed system – the technology is made available everywhere at once and facilitates competition across an entire population, which kind of makes it sound great for the lowest skilled workers in the population.</p>

<p>But I want to add a dimension to Leamer’s framework that considers not only your starting position within a country, but also the relative position of your country relative to other countries (ranked by per capita GDP, workers’ rights, cost of living, or anything else that correlates with cost of labor).</p>

<p>An example will help illustrate why this additional dimension matters.</p>

<p>Take the perspective of a national economy as a closed system – if you start off in one of the lower bands, the forklift might enable you to do a job you previously could not do, making you relatively better off than before.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the global perspective, and imagine you are this same person in a lower-ntile of the income distribution within your country. Add the extra dimension that you live in one of the higher GDP countries, so your initial position globally is better than that of someone with your same skills and job in one of the lower GDP countries. With this framing, even though the forklift levels the playing field within your own country, it also entails A LOT more competition for you from every other country, which means you’ll be relatively worse off globally (and, the workers in the lower GDP countries will be relatively better off).</p>



<p>I have also added a few new technologies to Leamer’s forklift and microphone set (which I labeled as representatives of “manufacturing” and “media” respectively): shipping container for “globalization,” video conferencing for “virtualization,” and stethoscope for “listening.”</p>

<p>This little win / loss matrix provides a concise summary of the key technology trends afoot today:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/forklifts-and-microphones/win-loss-matrix.png"><figcaption>Win / Loss Matrix for (Global) Adoption of a New Technology</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How I scored this is up for debate / somewhat speculative. I’m curious how others would score it differently.</li>
  <li>However you score it, I think the exercise demonstrates that all technologies do not benefit everyone equally.</li>
  <li>I have chalked up pretty much any new technology as a win for the capital class in any country, since they will typically either own related IP, earn a return on investment by provisioning the new technology, or extract rent if they control distribution, eg, in the case of media companies monetizing content.</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>full notes on how I scored my scorecard .............................................</summary>
<div>
    <ul>
      <li>Forklift: high earners everywhere win because they own the tech, lower earners in higher GDP countries lose due to increased competition from lower earners in lower GDP countries (who relatively win).</li>
      <li>Microphone: a few superstars win big and can reach infinite audiences, consequently way fewer jobs (both singing and in related things like event production), the real winners are high earners in any country who own the distribution rights, technology, and relationships (eg, record labels, digital media companies).</li>
      <li>Shipping container: good for higher earners everywhere who own the containers, ships, distribution networks; good for lower earners in lower GDP countries when manufacturing is exported there, bad for lower earners in higher GDP countries because they lose manufacturing jobs.</li>
      <li>Video conferencing: good for high earners everywhere because it facilitates knowledge sharing and trade; good for lower n-tile / lower GDP workers when knowledge work is exported to them, bad for lower n-tile / higher GDP workers because they lose knowledge work jobs.</li>
      <li>Stethoscope: perhaps the most positive sum of all of these, least subject to monopoly / rents (tho you could argue that higher earners that own the tech benefit more than workers using the tech).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<p>In the rest of this essay, I want to discuss the winners and losers posited in the “virtualization” column of this matrix.</p>

<h2 id="virtualization-post-covid-as-globalization-on-steroids">Virtualization post-COVID as Globalization on Steroids</h2>

<p>If adoption of virtualization technology resembles any other technological trend, I think it will be most similar to globalization, but on steroids.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my own personal observations and anecdotes how this is playing out during the pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="the-shift-to-remote-work-via-zoom--slack-will-stick">The Shift to Remote Work via Zoom / Slack Will Stick</h3>

<p>COVID has forced all firms who can virtualize to experiment with it, and the results have largely been positive. For desk jobs, the technology to support remote work has existed for quite awhile, but I think two things held back the shift to remote until now.</p>

<p>First, there was hesitation on the part of firms about losing the high bandwidth / low latency forms of communication afforded by physical proximity. Many at my own company (a small SAAS software business) were specifically skeptical about losing (1) water-cooler and lunch chats for unstructured / exploratory discussion, and (2) white-boarding and tapping people on the shoulder for resolving issues and questions immediately.</p>

<p>So far, in the short term, we have not missed these as much as we expected. If anything, net/net, our team is higher productivity than when in the office.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure id="w-node-d2eae0c6afad-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f443920701d151f90e0a2_audit-trail.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>App security means app visibility, and <strong>audit logs</strong> are becoming a key requirement of both enterprise customers and fast growing startups. Building audit logs into your app will help land those larger deals and give your customers conviction in your product’s security profile – but actually choosing which events to log, deciding on payloads, and exposing events via the right APIs is far from easy. Our guide will walk you through the basics that every developer should know: why audit logs are important, event formats, SIEM tools, retention best practices, and everything else you didn’t realize you needed to know. </p><h2>The basics: what audit logs are and why you should care</h2><p>CIOs and IT admins (and really anyone involved in security) need <strong>full visibility</strong> into the apps their teams are using: who’s logging in, resetting their password, and accessing what data. Let’s imagine we’re an internal IT admin at Kellogs – and we want visibility into how our organization is using Salesforce. A few things we might be curious about:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Has someone tried and failed to log in 10 times in the past hour?</li><li>Who accessed PII (personally identifiable information) in the past week?</li><li>How many users accessed a sensitive report that was accidentally shared with the wrong team?</li></ul><p>Audit logs answer these questions by providing a granular paper trail of what app users have done. Every time a user does anything of consequence – log in, reset password, create report, you name it – your system emits an event with useful metadata about that event. Companies will <strong>expose</strong> these events via a UI and/or an API so admins can analyze them at scale. Here’s a quick example of what an event might look like:</p><p>The data in audit logs have a variety of different possible use cases by IT admins. In specific industries such as finance, there are laws that require companies store a “paper trail” of user behavior (such as messages) in an audit log, often referred to as data retention. These logs may also be used for digital forensics in the case of a breach, or “e-discovery” during a lawsuit. However in most cases, audit logs are primarily used by admins to inspect user behavior during configuration and set up alerts for potential malicious actors or account compromise.</p><p>Audit logs aren’t only a requirement for giant monolithic enterprises; the need for visibility is being pushed “downstream” to smaller companies as they use more and more applications. Audit logs will help your business move upmarket, but they’ll also help improve retention and close your existing target deals faster.</p><h2>What kinds of events to emit and how</h2><p>Building audit logs into your app isn’t <em>technically</em> difficult – if you’ve instrumented your product with something like Segment already, it’s very similar code. As with most enterprise features, the devil is in the details: what kinds of events to emit, what the payload should be, how to store events, and how to integrate these events with the wider enterprise toolkit.<br></p><h5><strong>1. What kind of events to log</strong></h5><p>The goal of audit logs is to provide a paper trail of important actions that help IT admins and security folks get a detailed picture of what’s happening in your app – that’s the driving logic for what kinds of events you should be writing. </p><p>Chances are you already emit events in a similar fashion: but your audit log events <strong>should not be the same as analytics or observability events</strong>. This is a common mistake companies make - the kind of data a team needs internally for product analytics and general instrumentation will <em>overlap</em> with audit logs, but different use cases necessitate different data (especially handling concerns around PII). The same is true of your observability data: if you’re sending events to Elasticsearch / Prometheus / Honeycomb / your monitoring system of choice, those events might overlap with audit logging use cases – but you’ll need to do a ton of scrubbing and cleaning in advance. </p><p>There’s no catalog of what <em>exact</em> events to instrument, but a few general guidelines might help:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Login / auth</strong> - Anything related to signing up, signing in, resetting passwords, updating usernames, etc.</li><li><strong>Data access</strong> - Opening, updating, or deleting a document or spreadsheet (whatever the canonical unit of your product is).</li><li><strong>Billing</strong> - Updating billing or subscription info.</li><li><strong>Search / navigation</strong> - Using search, navigating around the product.</li></ul><p>Conversely, here are a few examples of things that you <em>shouldn’t</em> be including in your audit logs:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Performance data</strong> - How long a job took to run, CPU usage, etc.</li><li><strong>Internal tracing</strong> - Errors, exceptions, and stack traces.</li></ul><p>If you’re not sure what kind of events to include, look to other products and talk to your customers - they might have specific requirements custom to their compliance needs. <br></p><h5><strong>2. Event payloads and formatting</strong></h5><p>There’s no widely accepted standard for audit log payloads yet, so things are kind of a mess. The general rule of thumb is to include enough information to be useful, but nothing that doesn’t fit the audit log use case (e.g. product data). The typical format looks something like this:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>An actor </strong>- The ID of the user that’s carrying out the action (can also be the system).</li><li><strong>A group </strong>- The permission group(s) the user is part of, usually an organization ID or domain.</li><li><strong>An action type </strong>- The name of the event (password_changed, authentication_successful).</li><li><strong>Timestamp</strong> - A... timestamp. Keep things in UTC, as always.</li></ul><p>Unsurprisingly, there is at least one standard that’s gotten some traction: it’s called the <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/CORP_KNOWLEDGEBASE/78000/KB78712/en_US/CEF_White_Paper_20100722.pdf">Common Event Format</a> (CEF), and it comes from <a href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/siem-security-information-event-management/overview">ArcSight</a>, a SIEM provider (more on that later). The standard is aimed at making it easier to communicate between security systems, and prescribes a library of standard event fields like sourceHostName and and requestURL. However, in practice most audit log systems do not match the CEF.</p><p>Whether you follow the CEF or not, there’s one thing you can do: <strong>standardize internally</strong>. Keeping the same structure across all audit events will improve your user experience and make building your audit logs portal a lot easier. This is true across all product instrumentation, but doubly the case here - before building audit logs into your app, sit down with your stakeholders and customers to figure out which fields should be standard and required.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>3. Retention windows</strong></h5><p>If you’re supporting thousands of users, your audit logs will start to take up a good amount of space. They’ll also need to be indexed for fast search and filtering on various facets. Unnecessarily keeping audit logs forever isn’t always the right approach. Companies typically run a 90 day retention window and allow customers to pay for longer term storage such as 1 - 3 years. We’ve seen companies store these logs in relational stores like Postgres, search systems like Elasticsearch, and even as flat files in an S3 bucket. Another important note: audit logs should be immutable once they’re stored. That’s the whole point.<br></p><h5><strong>4. Building a frontend</strong></h5><p>Once you’ve set up the right system for emitting events on the backend, you’ll need to build a frontend to expose those events to your users. We’ve seen implementations as simple as a table with events in it, and as full-featured admin panels with search, filtering, sorting, and exporting to SIEM solutions (more on that later). What you build depends on the use cases your customers have: detailed frontends are useful if your users are going to interact with audit logs directly in your app, but can be overkill if you’re dealing with much larger customers who will want to export these logs to a different tool anyway.</p><figure id="w-node-ee3bce30d6ea-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f6295e9f2b67123846b07_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-27%20at%206.25.52%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example audit logs UI from the WorkOS dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>Once you’ve got your events system and frontend in check, you’ve got one more thing to worry about: integration.</p><h2>Integrations: working with SIEM tools</h2><p>When you’re serving hundreds or thousands of users, combing through audit logs manually to find the data you need isn’t going to work. Enterprise admins use specialized tools called SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to ingest audit logs and provide search, grouping, and visualization. The relationship here is somewhat similar to Elasticsearch / Kibana, where the visualization tool is purpose-built for a specific use case - but SIEM tools go further down the stack to manage storage and search. </p><p>One of the best known SIEM tools is <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/siem-security-information-and-event-management.html#:~:text=Splunk%20Enterprise%20Security%20(ES)%20is,real%2Dtime%20monitoring%20and%20more.">Splunk</a> – it’s a general purpose aggregation and visualization tool with features built specifically for audit logs. Another good example is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/#features">Sentinel</a>, an Azure specific SIEM from Microsoft. The general idea is that you get a dashboard that aggregates key events over time, as well as granular search and filtering for when you need to dive into specific patterns.</p><figure id="w-node-35807cb27f2b-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f54bbc283594367199c89_image%20(5).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Enterprises will typically be using a SIEM tool like Sentinel, so your systems are going to need to integrate and export data, which, as you can probably guess, isn’t very much fun. Like <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">SSO and SAML</a>, each SIEM solution is going to have different ingestion requirements. Currently there are at least 35 <a href="https://codingcompiler.com/siem-tools-list/">popular SIEM providers</a> out there and many large enterprise admins have bespoke solutions too. You’re lucky if they only request to drop logs in an S3 bucket. We’ve even heard of IT admins wanting a streaming SSH tunnel of events.</p><h2>Walkthrough example: Slack</h2><p>To put all of this together, let’s take a look at a company that <a href="https://workos.com/blog/how-being-enterprise-ready-helps-slack-land-big-deals">has successfully moved upmarket</a> through building great enterprise-ready features: Slack. If you’re on the <a href="https://slack.com/pricing">Enterprise Grid plan</a>, Slack provides access to audit logs via a <a href="https://api.slack.com/enterprise/audit-logs#the_audit_event">read-only REST API</a> that covers pretty much any event that would be of interest to an IT admin or security team. Here are a few examples of the kinds of audit events that Slack retains:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>workspace_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new workspace is created.</li><li><strong><em>organization_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new organization is created.</li><li><strong><em>ekm_enrolled</em></strong> – Emitted when an organization enrolls in Slack’s <a href="https://slack.com/enterprise-key-management">EKM.</a></li><li><strong><em>user_channel_join</em></strong> - Emitted when a user joins a channel.</li></ul><p>Each event comes with a semi-standard payload: an <strong>actor</strong> (the user who carried out the action), an <strong>action</strong> (the event type), an <strong>e…</strong></p></div></div></div></div>

<p>As you probably know, YouTube just sucks you in, especially with their recommended videos that seem so irresistible with their clickbait titles and thumbnails. I’ve found that the best way to protect against excessive YouTube binge watching was to turn off search and watch history. I’ll go through different approaches I’ve tried and explain why I’ve most recently settled on this method.</p>
<h2 id="methods-tried">Methods Tried</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="blocking-youtube">1. Blocking YouTube</h3>
<p>I first tried to block YouTube entirely in the hopes that I would stop watching. I removed all YouTube apps from my phone and did a <code>hosts</code> file block of youtube.com on the computer. However, as I’m a software engineer, there were a lot of topics I needed to look up, like technical tutorials, or how to fix a certain bug. For your job or profession, or especially if you’re a student, there are many good videos on YouTube that have valuable information, so a blanket ban doesn’t make sense and can be quite inconvenient.</p>
<h3 id="unsubcribing">2. Unsubcribing</h3>
<p>I then unsubscribed from any channel that was unproductive, such as hardware news, cooking recipes, and crucially, “edutainment” like Wendover Productions, Binging with Babish, Kurzgesagt, and other such channels. These channels serve to keep you entertained under the guise of learning more, but really, when are you going to ever utilize this knowledge? I know I’ve never cooked anything from Babish’s videos, and when I did want to make something, I would just look up that specific topic on YouTube. Even if you do find it useful, it is probably only a few videos out of the myriad that they produce, so the signal to noise ratio is extremely high, and for me, it’s not worth wasting so much time for a fraction of the benefit.</p>
<p>I also tried unsubscribing from everything, but again, some channels are quite useful, such as technology conference talks relating to my field, so I couldn’t keep that up.</p>
<p>However, even though I unsubscribed, I still found myself watching videos from these channels, due to the YouTube recommendation engine knowing that you want to watch this type of content, so once you watch one video, it’ll keep receommending more videos from the same channel and similar videos from other channels. To solve this entirely, I needed to get rid of the recommendations themselves.</p>
<h3 id="turning-off-recommendations">3. Turning Off Recommendations</h3>
<p>This has worked the best out of the solutions I’ve tried. It allows me to not binge watch because YouTube doesn’t actually save what I’ve watched to recommend me anything, yet I can still subscribe to the channels I need. Because I rarely watch videos that YouTube recommends that aren’t in my domain of interest (viral videos, trending videos, etc), I just get bored with even going to the YouTube homepage. Sure, I can search up a creator and watch them that way, but most of my watching comes from impulsively clicking videos on the homepage so I don’t really care to even search up the channels.</p>
<p>To turn off recommendations, you’ll need to turn off and delete search and watch history altogether, which might be a deal breaker for some, but I’ve never really need to go back through my history, I just search for the video I want to find again and the vast majority of the time I find it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-off-recommendations">How To Turn Off Recommendations</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols">Google’s My Activity - Activity Controls</a> and turn off YouTube Search History and YouTube Watch History.</li>
<li>Delete <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/item?restrict=yts">Youtube Search History</a> by clicking the trash can. This only removes it day by day so you can also do this via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history">YouTube’s History section</a>. To get here, click the hamburger icon in the top left, then click history. You’ll then see an option to “Clear all watch history.” You can also delete watch history, comments, community posts and live chat comments here as well.</li>
<li>Delete <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/item?restrict=ytw">Youtube Watch History</a> by clicking the trash can, or delete it entirely as above.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you don’t like Google tracking your every move:
<ul>
<li>Look through and delete any of your activity on the same <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">My Activity page</a>. It’s crazy how it tracks every single thing you search, what apps you open, how long you spend on each one, etc.</li>
<li>Look through and delete your <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline">Timeline</a> activity which tracks where you’ve been geographically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Optional) Hide YouTube’s recommended videos section entirely through the extension Distraction Free YouTube. Note that this just hides the section, but the problem I’ve had is that I could easily toggle it when I wanted to procrastinate. I can’t re-add my search history from the past if I stop tracking it via the above method, so it’s a more complete way of not binging YouTube. The best option may be to follow the steps above and then also add this extension.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna?hl=en">Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/">Firefox</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Optional) On your phone or tablet, delete any YouTube apps you have:
<ul>
<li>iOS - Delete your YouTube app by long pressing it until it wiggles. Then, click the X that comes up.</li>
<li>Android - Since YouTube is a system app that comes with the phone, you need to disable it which is effectively like deleting it. Go to Apps in your Settings and find the YouTube app. It should have a button to Disable. Tap it and follow the prompts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it, your YouTube should now be pristine, and it may finally help you kick the binge watching habit while still being useful for looking up productive videos.</p>

There’s definitely an element of standardizing care.”</p><p>To train the AI to recognize prostate cancer, Dhir and his colleagues provided images from more than a million parts of stained tissue slides taken from patient biopsies. Each image was labeled by expert pathologists to teach the AI how to discriminate between healthy and abnormal tissue. The algorithm was then tested on a separate set of 1,600 slides taken from 100 consecutive patients seen at UPMC for suspected prostate cancer.</p><p>During testing, the AI demonstrated 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity at detecting prostate cancer – significantly higher than previously reported for algorithms working from tissue slides.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="927"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/435a01a1856340e2c7eb9222ae1678ec/10f875c46ca6524d-e4/s1280x1920/a283e324a29ff753a78e53d7376e632e1bc44012.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="927" width="1280" height="824"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Prostate biopsy with cancer probability (blue is low, red is high).

These all are clinically important features required as part of the pathology report.</p><p>AI also flagged six slides that were not noted by the expert pathologists.</p><p>But Dhir explained that this doesn’t necessarily mean that the machine is superior to humans. For example, in the course of evaluating these cases, the pathologist could have simply seen enough evidence of malignancy elsewhere in that patient’s samples to recommend treatment. For less experienced pathologists, though, the algorithm could act as a failsafe to catch cases that might otherwise be missed.</p><p>“Algorithms like this are especially useful in lesions that are atypical,” Dhir said. “A nonspecialized person may not be able to make the correct assessment. That’s a major advantage of this kind of system.”</p><p>While these results are promising, Dhir cautions that new algorithms will have to be trained to detect different types of cancer. The pathology markers aren’t universal across all tissue types. But he didn’t see why that couldn’t be done to adapt this technology to work with breast cancer, for example.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.upmc.com%2Fmedia%2Fnews%2F072720-dhir-prostate-ai-lancet&amp;t=ODA2ZWM3MzJiYWU0Mjg2NjQyMzUyMGQwZWEzYWM1NjNjNzQxMTQzYSxhQVc1MFkyNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625008272238313472%2Fai-identifies-cancer-with-great-accuracy&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596255511">University of Pittsburgh</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study”,&nbsp;<i>The Lancet Digital Health</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2FS2589-7500%2820%2930159-X&amp;t=MjdiYzZkMjk4MTY2ZDNkMDliYmY3OWQzMmY1Y2Y3MDNkNjY4Zjc2ZCxhQVc1MFkyNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625008272238313472%2Fai-identifies-cancer-with-great-accuracy&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596255511">https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30159-X</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/189795339262/ai-aml">AI can now detect acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>I get more hits to my site and RSS feed in a typical month now than I used to get in a given year. For a fifteen year old blog that started life as a Perl CGI script in high school, it’s been wild to see. Whether you’re coming here from Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, Discord, newsgroups, or the BSD Now podcast, hi! Sometimes I talk about tech here.</p>
<p>This marked increase in traffic corresponds with more feedback email, a not altogether insignificant number of which are negative. I’ll address some recurring themes here, because they’re Jason Bourne of the same misunderstanding of the kind of site people have come across.</p>
<p>Once you filter out the obvious trolls saying BSD is dead, Apple computers are for posers who value form over function, and that we’re all sheep for wearing a mask, most of the remainder concern the tone of my posts, and what they consider the ancillary topics I cover. They claim that my writing is too jovial, my site <a href="https://rubenerd.com/about/#mascot">mascot</a> drawn by Clara is inappropriate, and inclusion of posts about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/josh-on-how-to-peel-garlic/" title="Josh on how to peel garlic">cooking garlic</a> are a waste of time and somehow detract from my serious technical and political posts.</p>
<p><em>(One gentleman spent an inordinate amount of time criticising Rubi’s skirt in such lurid detail I felt but the tiniest twinge of what women must feel as creepy men ogle them walking past).</em></p>
<p>I appreciate—most of—the feedback, but respectfully disagree. There may not be many of us doing this anymore, but this is specifically a personal blog. This site has always been a labour of love for me since I started it in high school in 2004, and will necessarily be about stuff that’s on my mind and that I’m interested in. There are drier technical blogs by people I respect out there, but that’s not my style.</p>
<p>I’m also unsure how one can quantify detraction in this context. I remember having a similar debate with a WikiProject Albums contributor, who claimed compilation album articles similarly detracted from the quality of Wikipedia. In a finite space like a newspaper or book that might make sense, but in an electronic medium it seems to me the easiest solution is to ignore things in which you have no interest. Your also free to find an anime mascot drawn by my girlfriend offensive, just as I’m free to include her to make the world a slightly nicer place.</p>
<p>Which dovetails to the third comment which I take more seriously. I haven’t received permission to quote their email, but in summary they said my serious posts about COVID, social security, and attitudes in open source software communities are valuable, but sporadic. The implication is it’s incumbent upon me to only discuss important topics, and that by including what amounts to sidebars I’m trivialising them.</p>
<p>This one, selfishly, comes down to self-preservation. I need to write about the intricacies of BSD text editors and fun engineering or cooking videos to afford me sufficient mental fortitude to discuss serious topics. Sometimes we all need a break, and this is how I do it.</p>
<p>As I wrote on my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/the-first-post/">first post</a> fifteen years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… it’s a blog site with random stuff on it that I think is groovy, weird etc … maybe one percent of it, or maybe two, might be useful to someone, especially with respect to some of the tech problems I’ve had and solved over the years. So here it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<![CDATA[How to STOP everything being so critical and urgent]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/incident-management">here</a>.</p>

<p>At some point in a <em>Product Engineering</em> team you will be tired of every <a href="https://xkcd.com/1700/">bug</a> or issue being urgent and critical. This usually happens after dealing with several problems informed by late night Slack messages. At this point nobody really knows which issue is an urgent incident, which is worth waiting to the next morning and which isn’t even something worth solving. All this is harmful for the team’s culture and for the business itself. When everything becomes urgent, nothing is urgent and nobody cares anymore.</p>

<p>Unlike other processes, Incident Management doesn’t emerge naturally. It’s a defensive mechanism agains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdTMuivYF30">chaos</a>; it needs to be created and agreed on.</p>

<p>You can’t fix it all at once and you can’t do perfect from the beginning. But you need to start somewhere. This post is about how to go from having nothing related to Incidenct Management to having something.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p>You may feel the urge to adopt <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/">Pager Duty’s incident response process</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/incident-response">Atlassian’s Incident Management process</a>. Or even to use what’s in this post. Be careful. I’m writting what has worked for my team. Don’t just copy. You have a brain. Use it.</p>

<p>My team literally has all this written down in a Counfluence page. Writting it down is not enought. Everyone should agree to use it. You need to educate through workshops, talks and training sessions giving real life examples and making sure everybody understands the basic process you are about to set in place. Everybody must be on board.</p>

<p>First thing you probably need to address is everything being urgent and critial. For that you need to define what is really an <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/">incident</a> and a few severity levels. Give some real life examples and instructions on how to report each incident. Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect. With every incident you will adapt and iterate over it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-incident">What is an incident</h2>

<p>An incident is an event that causes disruption to a service or a reduction in the quality of a service which requires an emergency response.</p>

<p>That las part is important. Emergency response. An incident has such an impact that gives someone the right to disturb somebody else’s life.</p>

<h2 id="severity-levels">Severity levels</h2>

<p>When you detect an incident try to analyze the impact and apply a severity level. What is severity? The severity of an incident is derived based on the effect of that incident on the system. It indicates the level of threat and how can it affect the system.</p>

<h3 id="sev1">Sev1</h3>

<p>Critical incident that involves irreversible damage to the company or brand reputation, it must be solved instantly even if it means to take the site down. This should never happen.</p>

<p>Example: Security vulnerability exposing customer data, images showing violent content appear on the home page, customer accounts have been hacked.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Call the responsible Engineering Manager.</p>

<h3 id="sev2">Sev2</h3>

<p>Critical system incident actively impacting many customers’ ability to use the product. It is an incident which is a major blocker and has affected the functionality of the whole service. It affects the business as a whole.</p>

<p>Example: Showing big differences in prices, discounts that shouldn’t exist but apply to all the products, site down.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If nobody responds in 10 minutes, call the responsible Engineering Manager. The fix is to be deployed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="sev3">Sev3</h3>

<p>Stability or minor customer-impacting incidents that require immediate attention from service owners. Priority number one for the team involved. It can be fixed the next morning.</p>

<p>Example: One category is not working. Emails are not being sent.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If it happens out of office time it could be fixed the next day.</p>

<h3 id="sev4">Sev4</h3>

<p>Minor issues, cosmetic issues or bugs, requiring action, but not affecting customer ability to use the product, must be prioritized.</p>

<p>Example: One customer didn’t receive a confirmation email. One customer bought an item without stock. The image of a product is not correct.</p>

<p>Typical response: Only in working hours. Talk to the Product Owner and Team Lead of the team responsible for the service/feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/bug_fixing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>An incident’s severity level can be upgraded if it is not solved in a resonable amount of time. If that happens, you’ll need to take more severe and drastic actions.</p>

<h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2>

<p>Keep calm. Don’t pressure anybody. People work and communicat poorly under pressure.</p>

<p>You don’t need to set up all the roles of a mature <em>Incident Management</em> process. The most important one that you do need is the <strong>Communications Manager</strong> or <strong>Communications Lead</strong>. Somebody will take this role during an incident. This person keeps everybody informed about the status of the situation. What has been detected, what is being investigated, what the team has found, timeframe for resolution, actions that are being taken, etc.</p>

<p>If updates are not communicated regularly people get nervious. Even a message like <em>“We are still investigating.”</em> helps to keep the nerves under control. Give updates every few minutes. It may seem like a lot but believe me, it’s not. When in crisis mode, overcommunicate. I can’t stress this enough.</p>

<p>Later on you can add other roles as <strong>Commander</strong> or <strong>Deputy</strong>, set up <strong>On-Call</strong> processes, etc. All depending on your needs and customized to your organization and culture.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Start small. Something is better than nothing. And done is better than perfect. Educate and give people time to understand and use the process. Ask for feedback, use each postmortem to analyze the Incident Management process and try to improve it just a tiny bit.</p>

<p>Rustling leaves, light rain at the window, a quietly ticking clock - muffled sounds, just above the threshold of hearing. One moment we perceive them, the next we don't, even if we, or the sounds, don't seem to change. Many studies have shown that we never process an incoming stimulus, be it a sound, an image, or a touch, in the same way. This is true, even if the stimulus is exactly the same. This occurs because the impact a stimulus makes, on the brain regions that process it, depends on the momentary state of the networks those brain regions belong to. However, the factors that influence and underlie the constantly fluctuating momentary state of the networks and whether these states are random or follow a rhythm, was previously unknown.</p>
<p>Now, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig, Germany, have discovered that the sensitivity of the network state, at the time the stimulus-related information reaches the cerebral cortex, influences how strongly the brain reacts to the stimulus. Depending on the network state, certain nerve cells in &nbsp;this so-called primary somatosensory cortex can be more or less ‘excitable’, which shapes the following stimulus processing in the brain. This means that the brain's response is modulated already at the entry to the cerebral cortex and depends on more than how the stimulus is evaluated at higher, downstream levels.</p>
<p>"There is always a certain amount of activity between the neurons of a network, even if there are apparently no external influences on us. So, the system is never completely still or inactive," explains Tilman Stephani, PhD student at the MPI CBS and first author of the study, which has now been published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Rather, information is constantly arising, from inside the body about our heartbeat, digestion, or breathing, information about our position in space, the temperature, and internally generated thoughts. In addition, intrinsic neuronal activity occurs even if neuronal networks are isolated from any input. This constantly affects the excitability of various brain networks. "The dynamics from internal processes are thus associated with the system´s excitability and therefore, also the stimulus response," says Stephani. "So, the brain does not seem to function like a computer where the same incoming information always means the same reaction."</p>
<p><strong>Fluctuation between highly and less excitable moments does not occur at random</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that fluctuations of cortical excitability do not occur completely at random but rather show a certain temporal pattern: The excitability at one moment depends on previous network states and influences subsequent ones. Scientists refer to this as long-range temporal dependency or long-lasting autocorrelation.</p>
<p>The fact that cortical excitability varies in this special way suggests that neuronal networks are poised at a so-called “critical” state, where there is a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition of the network. Earlier theoretical and empirical studies have indicated that such “criticality” may be a fundamental principle underlying brain functioning where information transmission and capacity are maximized. Stephani and colleagues now provide evidence that this principle may govern the variability of sensory brain responses in the human brain, too. Presumably, this serves as an adaptive mechanism of the brain to cope with the variety of information that is constantly arriving from the environment. A single stimulus should neither excite the entire system at once nor fade away too quickly.</p>
<figure data-description="<p>How strongly the cortex is excitable by a stimulus (lightning symbol) is not left to chance.

        <p>How strongly the cortex is excitable by a stimulus (lightning symbol) is not left to chance.

</figure>


<p>However, it is still unknown whether greater excitability leads to a more salient experience. In other words, do the study participants perceive the intensity of the stimuli different depending on the instantaneous excitability? This is now being tested in a second study. "But other processes can also play a role here," explains Stephani. "Attention, for example. If you direct it to something else, a first, strong brain response can still occur. However, higher brain processes downstream may then prevent it from being consciously perceived."</p>
<p>The experiments were carried out by examining the response of participants’ brains to thousands of small successive electrical currents. These stimuli were applied to the participants´ forearms to stimulate the main nerve in the arm. This, in turn, produced an initial reaction 20 milliseconds later in a specific area of the brain, the somatosensory cortex. Based on the evoked EEG patterns, they were able to see how easily each individual stimulus excited the brain.</p>

        <p>Debugging an MCU requires attaching a debugger via JTAG and halting the core. Or does it?</p>

<p>There are many situations where this debug strategy is not feasible such as on</p>

<ul>
  <li>production units where JTAG has been disabled.</li>
  <li>systems where halting the core causes the subsystem you are trying to debug to
fault. (i.e Asserts from the NRF52 SoftDevice after halting at a breakpoint<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>remote systems where only a UART or network interface is exposed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, ARM Cortex-M’s have us covered!</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>This week we explore how to debug running systems with ARM Cortex-M’s DebugMonitor
exception handler. We cover how to configure the MCU to operate in this mode and walk through an
example of installing breakpoints and single-stepping on a running device!</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, DebugMonitor handling is an underutilized feature that can be applied creatively
for a variety of debug use cases. I hope by the end of this article I can convince you of this as well!</p>

<h2 id="basic-terminology">Basic Terminology</h2>

<p>ARM Cortex-M’s support several “levels” of debug:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Halting debug</strong> - This is the typical configuration you use with a debugger like GDB. In this mode, the core is
halted while debugging. This mode requires access to the <strong>Debug Port</strong> via JTAG or SWD. We’ve
walked through an overview of how ARM debug interfaces work in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces">this article</a>.</li>
  <li>Tracing via the <strong><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/profiling-firmware-on-cortex-m">ITM</a></strong>,
<strong>DWT</strong> &amp; <strong>ETM</strong> - These peripherals let you stream instruction execution and data
accesses while the system is running. Tools such as Lauterbach’s Trace32<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">2</a></sup> and SEGGER’s JTrace<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">3</a></sup>
can decode these streams and present results in a GUI on your desktop.</li>
  <li><strong>Debug monitor mode</strong> - Enables debug on running systems via the DebugMonitor exception
handler. This can be helpful in scenarios where halting the core will cause timing
sensitive subsystems to fail or for use cases where connecting a debugger is not feasible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s worth noting that debug monitor support is not available for the ARMv6-M architecture
(Cortex-M0). However, it is implemented for all other Cortex-M architectures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="example-project-setup">Example Project Setup</h2>

<p>In the following sections, we will explore how to set up Debug monitor mode with a very simple bare-metal application running on a nRF52 using the following tooling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a nRF52840-DK<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> (ARM Cortex-M4F) as our development board</li>
  <li>SEGGER JLinkGDBServer<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">5</a></sup> as our GDBServer (V6.80b)</li>
  <li>GCC 9.3.1 / GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain as our compiler<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">6</a></sup></li>
  <li>GNU Make as our build system</li>
  <li>the simple CLI shell <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">we built up in a previous post</a>.</li>
  <li>PySerial’s <code>miniterm.py</code><sup id="fnref:miniterm"><a href="#fn:miniterm">7</a></sup> to connect to the serial console on the nRF52.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, we will extend upon the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-breakpoints">example app we built to explore how breakpoints work</a>.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-debugmonitor-exception">Enabling the DebugMonitor Exception</h2>

<p>Debug monitor mode based debugging works by triggering an exception known as the “DebugMonitor
Exception” when debug events take place. We’ll explore how to configure the handler in the
following sections.</p>

<h3 id="debug-halting-control-and-status-register-dhcsr-0xe000edf0">Debug Halting Control and Status Register (DHCSR), 0xE000EDF0</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/dhcsr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Monitor Mode Debug only works if halting debug is disabled. Notably, the <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> setting
above must be cleared. This bit can <em>only</em> be set via the JTAG/SWD connection and is <em>only</em> reset when a full
Power-On-Reset (POR) occurs or a debugger clears the bit on exit.</p>

<p>If you are trying to use Monitor Mode Debug, I recommend adding a check on boot for
this. Otherwise, you are bound to confuse yourself when you are trying to test the feature and have a debugger connected via JTAG/SWD:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>debug_monitor_enable</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>volatile</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>dhcsr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>0xE000EDF0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>EXAMPLE_LOG</span><span>(</span><span>"Halting Debug Enabled - "</span>

    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// code to set up debug monitor mode</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="tip-disabling-halting-debug-from-gdb">TIP: Disabling Halting Debug from GDB</h4>

<p>If you are using GDB, Halting Mode debug can be disabled manually by clearing <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> and setting
the appropriate value for <code>DBGKEY</code> (0xA05F):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) set *(uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0=(0xA05F&lt;&lt;16)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can also be a useful way to keep an active GDB session open and probe its state while
the system is running!</p>

<h3 id="debug-exception-and-monitor-control-register-demcr-0xe000edfc">Debug Exception and Monitor Control Register (DEMCR), 0xE000EDFC</h3>

<p>The core configuration for the DebugMonitor exception is controlled in the upper 16 bits of the
<code>DEMCR</code> register:</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/demcr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MON_EN</code> - Controls whether the DebugMonitor exception is enabled or not. When enabled, debug
“events” will cause the exception to fire.</li>
  <li><code>MON_PEND</code> - Can be used to trigger a DebugMonitor exception irrespective of whether or not
<code>MON_EN</code> is set to 1.</li>
  <li><code>MON_REQ</code> - Not used by the MCU. Software can use this bit to convey state about monitor mode.</li>
  <li><code>MON_STEP</code> - Can be toggled from the DebugMonitor exception to enable hardware
single-stepping. When set, upon return from the exception handler, the core will execute a single instruction and then return to the DebugMonitor exception.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The lower bits (<code>VC_HARDERR</code>, etc) controls whether or not a debug trap occurs automatically when
various types of exceptions take place. These <em>only</em> take effect when using <strong>halting debug</strong>
mode. They allow you to guarantee the system is halted any time an exception path is hit which can be useful
when trying to debug!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="debugmonitor-exception-configuration-nuances">DebugMonitor Exception Configuration Nuances</h4>

<p>The DebugMonitor exception will only be triggered for debug events when the group priority of the
exception is greater than the current execution priority.</p>

<p>This can be a useful feature to guarantee that certain high priority operations (i.e Bluetooth
radio scheduling) continue to run while you step through the code in other parts of the system.</p>

<p>An important consequence however is it does mean any interrupts running above this priority of the
DebugMonitor exception will not be debuggable when using debug monitor support.</p>

<p>Configuring the DebugMonitor exception priority will require updating <code>SHPR3</code>. More details can be
found in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/arm-cortex-m-exceptions-and-nvic#system-handler-priority-register-shpr1-shpr3---0xe000ed18---0xe000ed20">our post about ARM Cortex-M exception handling</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c-code-to-enable-the-debugmonitor-exception">C Code to Enable the DebugMonitor Exception</h3>

<p>For simplicity in our example app we will set the DebugMonitor exception to the lowest configurable
interrupt priority. This means all other interrupts will be able to run while debugging code not
running from an interrupt.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we have:</p>

<p>When the DebugMonitor Exception fires, the DFSR can be inspected for information about what debug
event took place:</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/dfsr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Some of the events are only possible when using a <strong>halting debug</strong>. For the DebugMonitor the
states of interest are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DWTTRAP</code> Indicates the a debug event was generated due to a configuration in the DWT.</li>
  <li><code>BKPT</code> Indicates one or more breakpoint event took place (either via the FPB or a BKPT instruction).</li>
  <li><code>HALTED</code> Indicates the core was halted due to a MON_STEP request.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: DFSR bits are sticky and you have to write 1 to the value to clear them</p>

And I love it. By planning out my days with a simple pen and paper, I have become more productive and less stressed.</p><p>To help others decide whether they should try bullet journaling, I thought I'd write about why I love it and how I use it, with some caveats at the end.</p><h2>The Basics of Bullet Journaling</h2><p>Bullet journaling, reduced to its simplest form, is merely a pen, paper, and a legend. It was created by Ryder Carroll, who describes it as a tool to "help you track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future."</p><p>The system is based on planning your days by writing a list of tasks that can be marked as done or rescheduled. For long-term planning, yearly and weekly overviews can be created and easily referenced when writing down daily tasks and events. </p><h2>Why I Love It</h2><p>Bullet journaling has three main advantages that distinguish it from Google Calendar, Todoist, and similar digital tools. It keeps a permanent trace of events, is tangible, and offers amazing flexibility.</p><h3>Permanence</h3><p>By default, bullet journaling is a permanent way to keep track of life. As it is paper and pen based, everything written down leaves a trace. If you want to reschedule or delete a task or event, you can annotate it with an arrow or cross it out. There is no erasing. Although this might seem scary at first, it is incredibly helpful as it helps with reflection and weekly reviews.</p><p>Weekly reviews, which is part of the Getting Things Done methodology by productivity consultant David Allen, helps you tie up loose ends, schedule important tasks that came up during the week, and be mindful of the progress you made.</p><h3>Tangible</h3><p>With the arrival of the Digital Revolution, I think the value of tangibility and analog systems is becoming underrated. Digital tools have amazing features, but it can quickly become too complex and overwhelming. Being able to flip through actual pages and slowly write down tasks and events has helped me be calm in the midst of a chaotic world. Writing down my tasks, which takes more time than typing them out, makes me give more thought to the importance of each task.  And since paper is not of infinite size, I find it easy to avoid over-scheduling my time and energy. This helps with mindful productivity, <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mindful-productivity-2">a sustainable way to work and think</a>.</p><p>An obvious difference between bullet journaling and digital tools is the lack of notifications. However, by writing everything down and having my journal in front of me at all times, I find that I remember tasks effortlessly and don't need to be bombarded with notifications. I am less stressed this way as I don't need to worry about missing a notification since everything is stored in my brain. In a sense, the lack of notifications is a plus.</p><h3>Flexible</h3><p>Since the entire journal is a blank canvas, it is up to the user to create everything. It allows me to be creative and organize my weeks depending on the amount of work I have. I can also add extra features, such as habit trackers, book reviews, and idea spaces. This not only helps with having complete control over planning your days, but also helps with exploring fun creativity.</p><h2>How I Use It</h2><p>I start with a yearly overview, called a "future log", that allows me to note important events, deadlines, and birthdays. For each month of the year, I create a mini monthly calendar on the left, and leave space on the right for writing down those important dates. I then reference the future log when creating my monthly and weekly spreads to make sure I don't miss anything important.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>My monthly overviews consist of a large calendar that fills up two pages. The boxes can be filled in with important dates, and the remaining space contains my additional features like trackers and project ideas.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Finally, the most interesting spread: my weekly overviews. I have experimented with a lot of layouts, but the essentials are the same. I write down my tasks and events under the corresponding day, and then annotate them with my legend elements. Mine is currently as follows:</p><ul><li>dot: task</li><li>crossed-out dot: completed task</li><li>circle: event</li><li>filled-out circle: completed event</li><li>line-through: cancelled task or event</li><li>right-arrow: rescheduled task or event</li><li>left-arrow: task or event needs to be rescheduled

    </span></p><h2>Some Caveats</h2><h3>The Shiny New Object Syndrome</h3><p>Planning your life on paper with a new system will not automatically help you take control of real life. Like most tools, the bullet journaling system is a method to support you in being more productive, but will not do the work for you. You still need to do the tasks you have written down, and be fully present at the events you have scheduled. If your existing method works, then stick with it instead of taking the effort to transition to a new system.</p><h3>Dangers of Permanence</h3><p>Organizing in general can be a great way to plan and be productive. However, with a pen and paper, you can easily run into the soul-sucking problem of over-organizing. With a limited amount of space and no possibility of erasing, it can be easy to fall into the trap of needing to plan every minute detail to fit in nicely within the confines of the page. Since the future is uncertain and nothing ever goes to plan, this is practically impossible. Instead, feel comfortable with getting a bit messy and imperfect. It's all part of the process and gives you a better and accurate view of reality.
Having to leave tasks unchecked and needing to be rescheduled or crossed out can be another problem for those with a perfectionist eye. You may want to leave it as it is, and hope you finish the task miraculously before the end of the day. In the beginning, this might work as your motivation for aesthetics triumphs your low levels of energy and motivation for the task itself. In the long run, however, this is unsustainable and can leave you drained. Just reschedule the task! Being able to see what types of tasks you reschedule and the crossed out scribbles is a good method to assess your workflow.</p><p>It's better to view bullet journaling as a guideline to go about your day instead of a strict schedule. My bullet journal is filled with scribbles and random thoughts, which I didn't enjoy in the beginning. Over time, as I realized that aesthetics will not help me with my task, bullet journal has taught me to be okay with imperfection. As long as I'm moving towards my goals, that's perfect enough.</p><h3>The Invasion of Aesthetics</h3><p>Wanting something to look nice can be great, as long as it does not impede on its usefulness. With bullet journaling, a blank page means unlimited creativity and this can turn into a problem. A few weeks ago, I made the following spread:

I had taken inspiration from Pinterest, and I loved how it looked. However, in terms of practicality, it was useless. I could write three events at max, and tasks were just not written down. That meant I had to memorize what to do, so naturally, I forgot to do a few items on my list.</p><p>The advice that comes out of this: be as creative as you want until it hinders the use. I like to add a bit of cursive writing, a few drawings, colors, and that's it.  I like to be a bit creative as it helps me associate certain events and text with colors and drawings I made that week. You can also be like my brother and not have any colors or defined layout as long as it works.</p><h2>Tl;dr</h2><p>Bullet journaling is an effective way to increase mindful productivity and reduce stress. By being tangible and simple, a journal keeps a permanent record of tasks allows for the user to express their creativity and adapt the system to their needs.</p><p>To avoid becoming hopelessly entangled with digital tools and notifications, try bullet journaling.</p></section></div></div>]]>

    </span></p><p>Most of us have been given the same advice: to become a better problem solver, you need to solve more problems. But this advice is too simplistic. Getting good at anything requires more than just reps. It’s also <em>how</em> you go about it.</p><p>Besides, when programmers hear the advice “solve more problems,” they often think that “more” means faster. It’s a mistake I made when starting out. </p><p>The problem-solving treadmill can be detrimental to learning and improving. Early on I’d speed through one problem and head to the next. But the reality of that approach soon set in. By focusing on quantity, I compromised quality and missed key learnings along the way.   </p><p>It’s not to say that repetition doesn’t matter; it does. However, repetition alone doesn’t get to the heart of the matter. The process does.</p><p>I have a vested interest in this topic: I want to get better at solving problems in order to improve as a programmer. So here I offer my plan of attack. It involves reps to be sure—and a whole lot more.</p><h2>1. Solve a Variety of Problems on a Variety of Platforms</h2><p>“I was obsessed with HackerRank when I began learning to code,” said an instructor of a Python course I was taking. Although it’s fine to have a favorite platform, don’t limit yourself to a single one. Here’s why: you need to be ready for anything.</p><p>One goal of mine is to toggle smoothly among different problem types and across different platforms. The problems on Interview Cake are different than those in Reuven Lerner’s book, <em>Python Workout</em>. Likewise I find the problem statements in Lerner’s Weekly Python Exercise different from those on HackerRank.</p><p>I have my preferences, to be sure. However, I need to be able to solve problems of all types. So I’m using a variety of platforms and resources to get practice.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>LeetCode</li><li>Interview Cake</li><li><em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> by Gayle Laakmann McDowell</li><li>Exercism</li><li><em>Python Workout</em> by Reuven Lerner</li><li>Weekly Python Exercise by Reuven Lerner</li></ul><p>On Sundays, when I make <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/working-in-blocks-of-time">my plan</a> for the week ahead, I select a few problems from the above resources. I’m deliberate about it. For example, I’ll pick a problem that focuses on binary search from LeetCode. Then, one that focuses on data structures from one of Reuven Lerner’s sources. </p><p>This practice prevents me from getting too comfortable. I can’t rely on the same data structure or technique. I need to be able to pick the best tool for the job. I’ve got to be able to pivot. </p><p>It also challenges me. That’s because I select problems that push me to the edge of my limits, a feature of what psychologist Anders Ericsson calls “deliberate practice.”</p><p>Deliberate practice is all about skill development. It’s a fully-focused, conscious effort that takes you out of your “comfort zone,” centers on a specific goal, and “demands near-maximal effort,” Ericsson explains in his excellent book, <em>Peak</em>.</p><p>In other words, you’re not going through the motions doing something that comes easy or natural. “The hallmark of . . . deliberate practice,” Ericsson writes, “is that you try to do something you cannot do.”</p><h2>2. Cross-Train Your Programming Brain</h2><p>You often hear about athletes who incorporate cross-training into their routine. For example, a runner completes a bike workout or two each week. It makes a lot of sense: by cross-training athletes push their cardiovascular fitness from a different angle.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-you-should-cross-train-your-programming-brain">Cross-training for programmers</a> is a topic I’ve written about before. Yet, more needs to be said about the benefits of this approach. Just like an athlete cross-trains to improve their cardiovascular fitness, I’m incorporating cross-training to improve my mental fitness. </p><p>My cross-training involves solving math problems. I apply the same tactics I’d use to solve a programming problem but in mathematics. Same process, different context. </p><p>My current math book is one to note: <em>The Art of Problem Solving</em>. Yes, it provides the cross-training benefits mentioned above. But it’s doing something more: it’s helping me build my intuition for solving problems. </p><p>That’s an important point. I don’t want to memorize a math equation or process. I want to intuitively know when to use it. The same is true when solving programming problems.  </p><h2>3. Learn from Your Solutions</h2><p>All of us get stuck and all of us get errors while problem-solving. We use these failures to help us figure out what to do differently. </p><p>Oftentimes that’s where the learning stops. Once we’ve solved the problem we’re anxious to move along. But don’t. </p><p>Mathematician Richard Hamming suggests that’s when the learning should begin. </p><p>“I regard the study of successes as being basically more important than the study of failures...there are so many ways of being wrong and so few of being right, studying successes is more efficient,” Hamming writes in his book, <em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em>.</p><p>This idea of "looking back" and studying your successes is a topic I've <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-are-you-done-with-a-programming-problem/">written about previously</a>, and it's worth noting again.
You always hear about how we need to "learn from our failures." But Hamming is right: there's so much to learn from our successes.</p><p>So one of the biggest changes I’ve made to my problem-solving process is putting Hamming’s words to practice. I vividly recall solving my first problem that involved a linked list, a data structure that was new to me at the time. After I solved the problem, I studied it intently. I copied my solution into a Google Doc file and used comments to explain the code to myself. </p><p>I wanted to ensure I clearly understood <em>what</em> I did and <em>why</em> for this critical reason: so I could do it again. </p><h2>4. Get Feedback</h2><p>Awareness can be a wonderful teacher. </p><p>Don’t assume your solutions are great. Find out for yourself by getting feedback. Feedback is a critical factor when it comes to getting better. It’s also a component of deliberate practice.</p><p>There are two ways I’m getting feedback.</p><p>First, after I complete a problem, I study the solutions of others. Sometimes resources, like LeetCode and <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>, provide the solution. Other times I find the solution of a programmer who’s solved the same problem. Sometimes use both.</p><p>Either way, the next step is the same: I start at the top of the solution and explain each line in my own words. I speculate <em>why</em> the programmer chose this particular data structure, for example. Then, I write a short summary of the program to solidify the core concepts or new approaches that I just learned about.</p><p>Putting something complicated, like a line of code, into your own words is a great test to see if you really understand it. Plus, you get practice at another core skill: <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-reading-code-matters">reading code</a>.</p><p>If there’s something that’s new to me, I research it. I compare their code to my own. I study. I evaluate. I learn. It’s an arduous process, but I get so much from it.</p><p>The second way to get feedback is to simply ask another programmer for it. Video calls are helpful to step through code line by line in real time. Although, pull requests are useful, too.</p><p>There’s a point to the feedback: apply it! Put your learnings into practice.</p><h2>5. Be Consistent</h2><p>Now let’s talk about repetition. Problem-solving is a skill. Like any skill, it takes time to build. It simply doesn’t happen overnight or over a weekend. That’s why I devote time each day to problem-solving. </p><p>There’s a common reaction to this daily practice: “There’s too much to learn. I can’t spend time each day problem-solving.”</p><p>My response is two-fold. First, there’s always going to be something more to learn, <em>always</em>. </p><p>Second, in large part programming <em>is</em> problem-solving. It's fundamental to our craft. It’s worthy of your time and attention each day. Here’s the caveat: make your daily practice intentional. </p><h2>It’s an Art</h2><p>Many people regard problem-solving as an art. I happen to agree with that sentiment. The same can be said for the process itself. </p><p>The ideas outlined in this article are my approach for getting better at problem-solving. Your approach may look very different. The point is this: be intentional about your practice. Quality matters; make each problem count.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>There's a deceptive allure to a rewrite.  The logic can go something like this: </p>

<p>
The system is already in production, we obviously know how it works, so we just need to port what we have to a better platform, and once we're there things will be easier.
</p>

<p>In this chapter, we're going to rip this basic intuition to shreds.  Rewrites, as we'll see, are anything but easy.  While they may be immune to some of the challenges of a nascent app, they introduce completely new ones we often don't anticipate.  In order to successfully deliver a rewrite, we must navigate these challenges, and so it's important to understand what they are up front.  
</p>

<p>
Before we get into the hazards of a rewrite though, let's tell a quick origin story.  How did we get here in the first place?  
</p>

<h3>The Rewrite Origin Story</h3>
<p>
It all starts in the <i>Greenfield Development</i> stage, where we take an idea and begin to build from it a functioning application.  After weeks or months of dogged effort, something is eventually <i>Launched</i> to "market" (which may be actual paying customers, or just  a set of internal business users, etc.).  If the app is well received, it lives in the equilibrium stage of <i>Enhancement</i> for some period of time, where new features are added and defects are resolved.  Everyone is happy.  Eventually though, <a href="http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2019/the-trouble-with-tech-debt.php">technical debt</a> can accumulate, and we begin to see <i>Diminishing Returns</i> in our effort - whereas a week of development used to be enough to add an entire new feature, it might barely suffice now to change the color of a button.  
</p>

<img src="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/rewrite-lifecycle.png">
<p>
It's at this point that we might question whether it's worth sinking money and time into a lost cause.  Further, since the app was first launched, some exciting new technologies have probably emerged, and we may have some grand visions for how they could be leveraged to make our app more resilient, easier to work with, performant, etc.  And so we begin to make a plan for a rewrite.  The idea is to freeze development on the existing system for some short period of time, and then shift resources over to work on the replacement system.  We'll first build the foundation (using more modern patterns, tools, languages, etc.) and then next migrate the existing functionality into it.  Users will just need to ride out the "pause" (i.e. not get any new updates), but when the rewritten system is in place, productivity should be twofold (or more!) what it was before.
</p>

<p>
And while this "lift and shift" plan seems straight forward, it belies some critical risks - technical, organizational, and psychological factors all conspire to make this <i>Rewrite</i> stage extremely precarious.  Moreover, the longer this phase drags out, the lower the chance we will make it out (i.e. deliver the replacement).  So let's take a look at some of the dangers that lurk within...
</p>

<h3>Parallel Development</h3>
<p>
The first hazard we often confront on our journey is the realization that a rewrite is fundamentally a dual prong effort.  Sure, on the technology side we'd love to think we can pause development to focus only on writing code in the new platform, but reality (and more specifically, the business) rarely abides.  Maybe in order to win (or keep) an important customer, the business demands we add some new feature to the existing system NOW.  Or maybe a third-party system has changed its API and we need to refactor, or a sev-1 defect pops up, or a new government regulation is written.  The point is, <b>almost never can a production system sit static in space and time for long</b>, and that's true even during a rewrite period.  Some care and maintenance will inevitably be necessary on the old system, which means parallel development.
</p>

<p>
The first problem here is that developing in parallel violates that principle we developers hold most sacred: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</a>.  Any change made to the legacy system will need to be ported into the new system as well.  For example, if we add feature X into the old stack, we must add X again in the new one (but this time write it in the new language or framework).  And that duplicative effort applies for the testing, project management, build, and deployment of X as well.  Essentially, whatever it would cost (in time or resources) to make a change to the legacy system, it could now, during this rewrite phase, easily cost double.  
</p>

<p>
Even more, depending on how far along the rewrite effort is, the change (e.g. feature, defect fix, etc.) might need to be made to a part of the source code that has not yet been rewritten, and so the team will have to remember and account for it when they get there (which will then push the timeline back for the rewrite).  Or in the opposite case, the change is in a section of the app that has <i>already</i> been rewritten, and so the team has to circle back and make updates to code that was just migrated (and then re-test, etc.).  Either way, the parallel development element of a rewrite can make it feel like the team is keeping a plane flying while also building its replacement on the ground.  For the safety of the passengers, that plane's got to stay in the air, but if we spend too much focusing on its maintenance, we'll never get the new one off the runway.  And of course the team responsible for both "planes" is often one and the same, which leads to the next issue...
</p>

<h3>Team Schism</h3>
<p>
Given that there's some amount of effort necessary to support the existing system, the question is: who is responsible for this?  There are a couple approaches that teams typically take to manage the parallel work.  One option is to have the more junior developers stay back in maintenance mode, and thereby free up the senior devs to forge the path forward for the new system.  And this makes sense.  To pull off a rewrite generally requires a higher level of technical bad-assery - getting new technologies up and running and working together, configuring environments, establishing patterns and conventions, and so on are all tricky tasks that could leave a more green developer spinning their wheels in the mud.  
</p>

<p>
And so teams may settle on this type of split, junior developers to maintain, senior developers to go forward.  And it may work for a short while, but <b>it's not long until the senior devs are pulled back in</b> to help solve a critical all-hands-on-deck issue or discuss the impact of some change.  Their years of acquired knowledge of the old system and their relationships with business stakeholders, ops people, and others make them effectively irreplaceable.  They need to be included.  And even if these "pull-outs" only take up a couple hours a week, that level of context-switching can still stymie productivity.  As developers float back and forth between the old and new systems, the timeline for the rewrite just gets pushed back.
</p>

<p>
To avoid this, teams may take an alternative approach: spin up a new team that can be more easily dedicated to the rewrite.  The developers on this "rewrite team" would have negligible ties to the existing system (maybe they're consultants, new hires, etc.) and would therefore be better able to isolate themselves and stay productive on the new work.  Problem solved?  No.  The first issue, of course, is that these developers are by definition less familiar with the codebase, domain, and generally how and why things work the way they do.  Sure, they have the original code as documentation, but this can be like learning a programming language by looking at the source.  It's all facts, but no story.  And so this new team will either flail while trying to understand the intricacies and complexities of the existing system, or make bad assumptions just to move forward, or end up having to pull in the original team anyway.  None of these are productive outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, this "fresh team" approach can also alienate the veteran developers who are charged with staying back to support the legacy system, and make them feel as though they are being penalized for their loyalty and experience.  While the new team gets to work with modern technologies and a clean slate, they are still left in the doldrums of maintenance.  No fun.  And so unsurprisingly, this can quickly lead to disgruntled developers and shortly after that, brain-drain.  Somehow a team structure needs to be devised where the old system can be supported, the new system can be built correctly and efficiently, and everyone is happy.  But even when you put the right people on the right busses, there are still surprises...
</p>

<h3>Unknown Unknowns</h3>
<p>
Now even if the rewrite team is staffed with seasoned developers - i.e. those who either helped write the legacy system or at least have some experience with it - there are always surprises when migrating the existing source code to the new platform.  Donald Rumsfeld (yes, <i>that</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>) made this not-so-crazy insight about these types of surprises:  

</p><p>
Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.
</p>

<p>
When we begin the rewrite process, we typically try to estimate how much effort it will be.  And it's here where we begin to catalogue the first two categories of work.  There are of course segments of the codebase that we have direct experience with, and so we give quicker (and more accurate) estimates.  These are the known knowns.  But then there are also pockets of the system that we recognize we have less direct experience with, and so we add a little buffer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure id="w-node-70a9116c0fe8-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f20a0e12e2249592eae4d8e_Frame%2015.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you want more people using your product, the easiest place to start is making it easier to actually sign up. <strong>Adding SSO to your app</strong> will help you land those larger enterprise deals and decrease the signup friction that keeps causing your visitors to drop off. For modern developers though, the world of XML, SOAP, and OASIS standards can be opaque. Fear not: our guide will walk you through SSO: what it is, why it’s important, and best practices for getting it up, running and integrated with your app.</p><h2>The basics: what SSO is and why you should care</h2><p>The easiest way to understand SSO quickly is to think about your app’s authentication as a service. Most developers build the service themselves: you take care of creating usernames and passwords, adding them into a database, and checking credentials every time someone logs in. But in the same way that you skip building payments infrastructure and use Stripe, you can “outsource” your auth and have someone else do it; and that’s what SSO is.</p><p>If you’ve heard of SSO before, you’re probably thinking of it as a security feature, and that’s true; but where it really shines is through <strong>increased engagement</strong>. Making it easier to sign up for and sign into your product lowers friction for users, increases retention through smoother login flows, and helps you land those elusive enterprise deals (many enterprises can’t work with vendors who don’t support SSO).</p><p>Apps with SSO enabled allow users to authenticate through someone else’s service: instead of you managing usernames and passwords, you integrate with a provider like Okta or OneLogin that does it for you. Those services – called Identity Providers, or IDPs if you want to save time – are generally more full-featured and secure than what your typical growing startup would be able to build themselves.</p><p>SSO is a given among everyone from high growth startups to more traditional enterprises. Here’s the Dropbox sign-in page: they’ve built SSO with Google and Apple as two headline IDPs (they also support Okta).</p><figure id="w-node-171366ed88a2-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87ff2e125d68276a54_5ef11a093ff6f8501b52b19b_dropbox.png" alt="Dropbox SSO"></p></figure><p>Slack, Asana, Notion, Airtable, and Trello all support SSO too, and some even charge extra for it (you can find them on the <a href="https://sso.tax/">SSO Wall of Shame</a>). It’s pretty much part of the standard growth playbook.</p><h2>Learning the lingo: SAML, SPs, IDPs, and assorted acronyms</h2><p>Let’s get a little deeper into how SSO works. One thing worth noting: SAML isn’t the only protocol you can use to implement SSO. OAuth (1.0 and 2.0) are also popular, as well as WS-Fed and OpenID Connect. The broad concepts can carry over across protocols, too.</p><p>If you’re integrating SSO into your app, you’re a ​<strong>service provider​</strong> (SP). Your app is the service. The provider that you’re “outsourcing” identity to – like Okta or OneLogin – is called the ​identity provider ​(IDP). Simple enough, right? Where things start to get a bit more complex is when your app needs to ​communicate​ with identity providers to actually authenticate your users. SSO works with a communication protocol called ​<strong>SAML</strong> ​(Security Assertion Markup Language) that governs these phone lines.</p><p>SAML – and by extension, how you build and work with SSO – works through <strong>assertions</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-fda86aed2629-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87a82ddb32f4057b52_5ef11a0adb11ec2004c7bc71_assertions.png" alt="SSO Assertions"></p></figure><p>Let’s walk through a typical SAML flow, starting with a user trying to sign in through your site.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5>1. The SAML request from the SP</h5><p>When a user navigates to your login page (to log in, of course), they’ll either enter their email or click a button that takes them to an IDP portal like Okta. Your app issues a SAML request (and a browser redirect) to the IDP: it’s basically saying “hey, this user wants to sign in, do me a favor and verify that I should let ‘em in.”</p><h5>2. The SAML assertion from the IDP</h5><p>At the IDP, they’ll enter their full credentials, and deal with more extensive security measures like 2FA. Once they’ve successfully authenticated with the IDP, the IDP sends your app a response containing an assertion: this user is good to go, and you can let them in.</p><p>SAML works via XML (for all those SOAP fans out there. Nobody? Ok). Here’s an example of what a response containing an assertion might look like (thanks to <a href="https://www.samltool.com/generic_sso_res.php">OneLogin</a>):</p><p>The flow we just outlined is called ​<strong>SP-initiated​</strong>, because it started at ​your​ app, and you’re the service provider. There’s another way this can go down though: users can ​start​ at their IDP (like the Okta app directory), click on which app they want to sign into, and then authenticate and redirect. That’s called ​<strong>IDP-initiated​</strong>.</p><h2>Getting practical: how to add SSO to your app</h2><p>Like pretty much anything in software, there are two ways to add SSO to your app: you can build it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you.</p><h5>1. <strong>Building SSO from scratch</strong></h5><p>Building SSO yourself is all about handling and working with the protocol you choose: assuming you’re targeting larger companies, we’re talking about SAML here. This isn’t a technical tutorial, but here are a few high-level components you’ll need to write:</p><ul role="list"><li>A SAML controller for handling requests and providing responses to your integrated IDPs.</li><li>A SAML service to verify x509 certs, entity IDs, and IDP URLs, alongside parsing SAML assertions and creating and validating SAML responses. You’ll particularly enjoy the XML parsing and IDP-specific request formats.</li><li>A strategy to correctly authenticate users in your app based on the attributes that IDPs send back (you’ll need to normalize these if you’re supporting multiple customers).</li></ul><p>If any of this sounds weirdly unfamiliar to you, that’s because it probably is: there’s a lot of upfront research required to understand the right way to do it. It’s not as simple as adding a new frontend library and skimming through the docs.</p><p>Part of the challenge of building SSO from scratch is customization: you’ll need to build SAML flows for each IDP independently. SAML is a standard and like any good standard it’s often fractured and can sometimes be a pain to work with. As usual, XKCD gets it.</p><figure id="w-node-ccb9efecc6ca-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87590fbe675d1eb724_5ef11a0aa1289c05c64daeb7_xkcd.png" alt="XKCD"></p></figure><p>Over the past few years, the web dev ecosystem has developed a few packages that take care of some of the repeatable work. Middleware like <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">​passport.js<strong>​</strong></a> can help you avoid building everything from scratch; or if your backend is in Python, OneLogin offers a <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python-saml">python-saml​</a> package.</p><h5>2. <strong>Use an SSO provider</strong></h5><p>If you don’t want to build SSO yourself (I mean, why would you?), there are a bunch of great third-party services that offer SDKs and packages to make integration as easy as a few lines of code.</p><p><strong>➞ WorkOS (we're biased)</strong></p><p>WorkOS lets you add SSO to your app with just a few lines of code, and it’s completely free. Integrate once and you can support SAML with IDPs like Okta, GSuite, OneLogin, and more. Here’s what that same SAML flow above might look like with something like WorkOS:</p><figure id="w-node-9f81c6e54660-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef874de037b12ed1bd53_5ef11a0a3b878a5998d1038b_sso-workos.png" alt="SSO WorkOS"></p></figure><p>WorkOS ships with something pretty cool – <a href="https://workos.com/docs/sso/embed-workosjs">WorkOS.js</a> – that allows your end-users to configure their own​ SSO connections to their IDP of choice.</p><figure id="w-node-3fccad929910-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f07eb72970fa85d5dbd58cd_workos-workosjs-compressed.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Doing this manually is ​rough​: you need to coordinate with enterprise IT admins, exchange URLs and certificates, and build custom infrastructure like field mappers for SAML profiles. It’s not just frustrating; it drags out the integration cycle and takes up sales, support, and success time too.</p><p><strong>➞ Auth0</strong></p><p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing/">Auth0<strong>​</strong></a> is identity as a service: they offer SSO (among other products) that easily integrates into your app and supports all of the IDPs you’d ever need. Auth0 for social connections is free up to 7K users, and plans start at $23/mo for 1K users. If you want enterprise connections (think: SAML), you’ll need to move into the Developer Pro pricing tier, which starts at $28/mo for 100 users.</p><p><strong>➞ AWS Cognito</strong></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Cognito</a> is AWS’s identity-as-a-service product and supports SSO with SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenIDConnect. Cognito supports IDPs like GSuite and Facebook, and pricing is...well, it’s AWS, so you’re on your own.</p><p><strong>➞ GCP Identity Platform</strong></p><p>GCP’s identity-as-a-service goes by “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform">​Identity Platform</a>​” (catchy) and supports the standard feature set. It also comes with some interesting built-in Google features like Machine Learning based security measures (identifying compromised accounts). Pricing starts at $0.015 per SAML MAU when you’re over 50 MAUs.</p><h2>Best practices from some engineers who have done it before</h2><p>Here are a few tips that might make your SSO integration process just a bit easier, whether you’re using a third-party provider building it from scratch.</p><h5>1. <strong>Security</strong></h5><p><em>Disallow username and password logins, password resets, and email address changes</em></p><p>If an organization is using SSO with your product, give admins the ability to disable username/password based auth for their users. It creates a more seamless SSO experience by avoiding false login starts and keeps things secure.</p><p><em>Enforce session timeouts</em></p><p>Expire idle user sessions to make sure users aren't signed in indefinitely — it's good practice to grab the SAML response's session timeout value and use that, but there are cases where having a "time to live" setting for each account is useful too.</p><p><em>Force sign-in for active browser sessions</em></p><p>If your app gets a new sign-in request, replace any currently active browser sessions with the newly authenticated session. This is particularly important for apps that lean toward multi-tab use, like IDEs or CRMs.</p><h5>2. <strong>Routing</strong></h5><p><em>Ask users for the information to determine the right IDP</em></p><p>If you plan on supporting multiple IDPs in your SSO implementation, ask users for their email address, account subdomain, or unique account URL to determine the correct identity provider for their login.</p><p><em>Make sure to deep link</em></p><p>If you’re asking users to authenticate from an existing product page or they’re expecting to land somewhere in particular in your product, you’ll want to implement deep linking in your SAML flows. You can use ​SAML’s RelayState parameter​ to get this working.</p><h5>3. <strong>UX</strong></h5><p><em>Disable email verification for SSO users</em></p><p>If your app sends verification emails on username/password signups, disable that for SSO authentication: it’s not necessary.</p><p><em>Use Just-In-Time (JIT) User Provisioning for first time sign-ins</em></p><p><a href="https://jumpcloud.com/blog/jit-provisioning-defined">JIT user provisioning<strong>​</strong></a> automates the account creation process for users signing in to your app for the first time via …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Background: <a href="https://ebbflow.io/">Ebbflow</a> is a multi-cloud load balancer that provisions browser-trusted certificates for your endpoints in addition to providing a client-friendly SSH proxy. Servers can host endpoints from any cloud, on premises, or from your home, all at the same time. It uses nearest-server routing for low latencies and is deployed around the globe.</p>
        <p>This post describes how Ebbflow vends its <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow">client</a> which is written in Rust to its Linux users, describing the tools used to build the various packages for popular distributions. In a future post, we will discuss how these packages are ultimately vended to users.</p>
        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/tux.png"></p><p>Ebbflow vends the client to numerous distributions of Linux based operating systems. Linux is free, flexible, and is widely used in the software community and is being used increasingly in consumer markets. Ebbflow uses Linux for development machines and production servers.</p>
        <p>To vend software to Linux users, you must consider the Distribution that the users may be running. For non-Linux users, a distribution can be thought of as a version or flavor of an OS. Each distribution provides package management systems and backround-service management software which may be different, adding complication to our task of vending our client.</p>
        <p>This guide will talk about the problems that need to be solved after the core code has been written and all that's left to do is get it into users' hands. So, given that we have our binaries, here are the main tasks that we must work on:</p>
            <table>
                <tbody><tr>
                    <td>Task</td>
                    <td>Solution</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Run the Daemon in the Background</td>
                    <td><a href="#daemon">Create a <code>systemd</code> service</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No Dependencies</td>
                    <td><a href="#static">Statically Linking</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Working with Distributions</td>
                    <td><a href="#package"><code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> Packages</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Automated Builds</td>
                    <td><i>Next Blog Post</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Vending the Packages</td>
                    <td><i>Next Blog Post</i></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody></table>
        
        <h3>Ebbflow Client 101</h3>
         <p>Ebbflow's job is to route user traffic to your web server application (or SSH Daemon) on your servers. The central Ebbflow service proxies data between user connections (e.g. browser, SSH client) and the client. The client then proxies the data to your web server or local SSH daemon. Users of Ebbflow install the client on machines that will host endpoints, be SSH-ed to, or both at the same time (which is very useful). The following diagram shows this visually.</p>
        <p><img id="clientdg" src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/clientdiagram.png"></p><p><small><i>Quick note: The client initiates the connection to the central Ebbflow service via an outbound TLS connection, which makes the client extremely firewall friendly. You may completely block all inbound connections but still host websites or be SSH-ed to! Also, this innovation allows the servers to be located in any network, and even change networks without any configuration at all. Ebbflow just receives connections from the general internet, and after authentication and authorization, will allow the server to host the endpoint or be SSH-ed to. Neat!</i></small></p>
        <p>The client has two parts, the CLI and the background daemon. Both of these programs are 100% Rust, 100% <code>async</code>, and 100% 'safe', <i>and</i> statically linked - the dream of any Rust developer! The <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflow.rs">CLI</a> is an executable tool named <code>ebbflow</code> that is used to tell the background to host new endpoints, disable or re-enable endpoints or the SSH proxy, and configure other settings.</p>
        <p>The background daemon is the second piece to this puzzle, and is the workhorse and is responsible for actually transferring bytes between the central Ebbflow servers and your local web server or SSH daemon. This daemon is just a long-running background executable named <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflowd.rs"><code>ebbflowd</code></a>.</p>
        <h3 id="daemon"><a href="#daemon">Backround Daemon / <code>systemd</code> Service</a></h3>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/systemd.png"></p><p><code>ebbflowd</code> needs to run in the background, run without a logged-in user, start on system boot or reboot, and be started again if it crashes. (most) Linux distributions provide a mechanism for this called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"><code>systemd</code></a>, which is a system to manage and execute "services". When <code>systemd</code> manages a service, it will start it, watch it, and fulfulls all of the needs we have.</p>
        <p><code>systemd</code> uses "unit files" as the means to know how a service should be handled. They can be very simple, and you can see Ebbflow's <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/assets/ebbflowd.service">unit file on GitHub</a>. The unit file points to the executable, declares a dependency that the system's networking services should be initialized first, and that the program should be restarted quickly if it exits. There are many helpful guides for <code>systemd</code> online from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files">general info</a> to more <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">reference</a> type guides.</p>
        <p>Below is the actual <code>ebbflowd.service</code> unit file used by Ebbflow.</p>
        
        <p>Simple, short, and gets the job done! The daemon will be restarted after one second, and will execute <code>/usr/sbin/ebbflowd</code> on our users' behalf.</p>
        <p>If you are making your own, you can get started quickly by changing <code>ExecStart</code> to your built program in whatever directory it lies in now. To run the service, we must do the following
        <small>
        </small></p><ol><small>
            <li>Add the unit to <code>systemd</code>'s known services<ul>
                <li><code>sudo cp myprogram.service /etc/systemd/system/</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Enable the unit so <code>systemd</code> will start it on boot, registering the unit file<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl enable myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Tell <code>systemd</code> to start your program<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl start myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Check that its running!<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl status myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Stop the program<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl stop myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
        </small></ol>
        <p>After writing and testing your unit file you will need to either instruct users to complete the above steps or, preferably, vend your Unit in a proper package so that the users can avoid managing the unit file themselves. Ebbflow's <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/assets/ebbflowd.service">unit file</a> is vended through the built packages which we describe later.</p>

        <h3 id="static"><a href="#static">Going Static</a></h3>
        <p>Rust will dynamically link against the OS's <code>libc</code> implementation when the standard library is used, which is the case for almost all substantial Rust applications. When compiling Rust on a Linux system Rust will dynamically link against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library"><code>glibc</code></a> by default.</p>
        <p>For background, linking against <code>glibc</code> is not necessarily a bad thing - you can reduce your binary size and benefit from any performance or security updates without changing your code. However, when vending your project to users, linking against something that is not under you control is not ideal. First off, when linking, you will link against a specific version of <code>glibc</code> - the version that your build system has. So let's look at a ficticious example where you build on Ubuntu 20.04 (which uses <code>glibc</code> version <code>2.31</code>) and vend to Ubuntu 18.04 (which uses <code>2.27</code>). If you build on your Ubuntu 20.04 system and <code>rustc</code> uses some feature of <code>glibc</code> <code>2.31</code> that is not present in <code>2.27</code>,  and you execute your code on the Ubuntu 18.04 system, your code may break!</p>
        <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Per reddit commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/i0465c/creating_linux_packages_for_rust_projects_12/fznavnw/">/u/STEROVIS</a>, the above statement is innacurrate, and instead of "breaking", the "program simply will refuse to run at all whether you use a nonexistent feature or not. The dynamic linker will instantly fail complaining about a missing <code>GLIBC_*</code> version symbol". Still, the program will not work!</p>
        <p>You could avoid this scenario by building and linking to a low <code>glibc</code> version, but how low? How far back should you go? What if you want to vend to users of very very old systems?</p>
        
        <p>For maximum flexibility and to gain ground against our goal of working on many distributions, you can avoid these problems by statically linking <code>libc</code> using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html"><code>MUSL</code></a>, a <code>libc</code> implementation that <code>rustc</code> can include in your built binary so your program can run without any <code>glibc</code> dependencies. To get started using <code>MUSL</code>, you add a new target to <code>rustup</code> by executing the following. Also note that you may need to install a musl package, for example on Debian execute <code>apt-get install musl</code>. </p><pre><code># Add new MUSL target to rustup
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Build!
$ cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code></pre>

        <p>Besides the <code>std</code> library, Rust code may link to other OS libraries most often OpenSSL or libsodium for crypto. The Ebbflow client avoids this by using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustls"><code>rustls</code></a> which uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ring">ring</a> under the hood. Rustls is an ergonomic TLS library for Rust. It is <a href="https://jbp.io/2019/07/01/rustls-vs-openssl-performance.html">highly performant</a> even compared to OpenSSL and recently underwent a 3rd party <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls/blob/main/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf">security audit</a> which showed no flaws. When you invest in the Rust ecosystem and use Rust-written libraries, you are rewarded with the ability to statically link which is a desireable situation.</p>

        <p><i>To this point, we've taken our project and registered the backround daemon with the OS using <code>systemd</code> and statically linked our code using <code>MUSL</code>. The client could be tested to run on a single machine, but there are many installation steps. From here, we will package up our daemon and unit file nicely using packages.</i></p>

        <h3 id="package"><a href="#package">Packaging for Linux; <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code></a></h3>
        <p>Each Linux distribution provides a Package Manager which is used to manage the installed software, called packages, on the system. Most distributions use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29"><code>.deb</code></a> or <a href=""><code>.rpm</code></a> package formats. <code>.deb</code> packages are used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a> distribution and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based">its derivitatives</a> such as Ubuntu. <code>.rpm</code> packages are used by other distributions such as OpenSUSE, Fedora, and CentOS. Each distribution may have a different CLI tool for managing packages, even if they use the same package format, but that problem will be solved in the next blog post.</p>
        <p>To create a package, you first create a format-specific specification or configuration file. Once your specification is created you use the format-specific build tool to build the actual packages, in our case a <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> file.</p>
        <h4 id="deb"><a href="#deb"><code>.deb</code> Packaging</a></h4>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/debpkg.png"></p><p>Building Debian packages for a Rust project is dead simple using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deb"><code>cargo-deb</code> crate</a>, which is used as a cargo subcommand. This command will create a <code>.deb</code> package from your Rust project and is highly configurable - check out the <a href="https://github.com/mmstick/cargo-deb">README</a> for all of the options.</p>
        <p>Working with <code>cargo deb</code> is simple, so simple that you don't actually need to touch any configuration at all if you have a simple Rust project: you can just execute <code>cargo deb</code> and the tool will infer all of the required settings and build your package!</p>
        <p>The Ebbflow client is more complicated, so we will provide configuration through <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L58-L76">the client's <code>Cargo.toml</code></a> …</p></div></div>

		<p><span>In </span><span><a href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">Giving GPT-3 a Turing Test</a></span><span>, Kevin Lacker found that GPT-3 does well answering simple factual questions like</span> <span>“Who</span><span> was president of the United States in 1955?”, but also happily answered absurd questions without noticing they didn’t make any sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: How many eyes does the sun have?<br>
A: The sun has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?<br>
A: A blade of grass has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?<br>
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.</p>
<p>Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?<br>
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.</p>
<p>Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?<br>
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep furiously.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the trickiest things about GPT-3 is that <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1284271608971100162">you can prove that it knows how to do something, but you can’t prove that it doesn’t</a>, since a slightly different prompt can get much better results.</p>
<p><span>Nick Cammarata of OpenAI </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497">responded to Kevin’s post on Twitter:</a></span> <span>“it’s all about the prelude before the conversation. You need to tell it what the AI is and is not capable. It’s not trying to be right, it’s trying to complete what it thinks the AI would do :)”</span></p>
<p><span>Nick changed Kevin’s prompt to add a prelude saying:</span> <span><i>‘This</i></span><span><i> is a conversation between a human and a brilliant AI. If a question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“normal”</i></span><span><i> the AI answers it. If the question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“nonsense”</i></span><span><i> the AI says</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“yo</i></span><span><i> be real”’</i> and added two examples of nonsense questions:</span><br>
<img draggable="true" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHdZT4UMAASHpN?format=png&amp;name=small" alt="Image" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><br>
I was surprised this worked. When I asked Nick, he said he didn’t try many prompts, and it’s possible he just got lucky, so I wanted to test the limits of what Gwern is now calling <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1285723744074452993">Uncertainty Prompts</a>.</p>
<p>Using the same prompt as Nick above, I got the same answer for the first nonsense question:</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: yo be real</p>
<p>Using ‘Show probabilities’ in the OpenAI Playground settings we can see how probable the model thought this next token was. In this case, it was pretty sure the question was nonsense, since ‘yo’, at 35.91% is twice as probable as the runner up ‘A’ at 17.50%</p>

<span>You can see the runner by manually entering</span> <span>‘A’,</span><span> while keeping the temperature at zero. It completes to</span>&nbsp;<span>‘A:</span><span> A quoit has two bonks.’ Let’s look at the next question.</span></p>

<span>In this case</span> <span>‘yo</span><span> be real’ wins by a narrower margin.</span></p>

<p>The ‘Temperature’ setting controls how likely the model is to choose what it thinks is the most probable next token each time. We set it high when we want creativity, but in this case we just want to see the most likely completion each time, so we’ll set it to 0.<br>

<p>We’ll add each question we ask to the end of this prompt, then replace it with the next question once we have our answer. For each answer, I’ll include all the different probabilities for the first word. I’ve mostly excluded math questions, which GPT-3 generally struggles with.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post I’m more interested in whether GPT-3 correctly identifies a question as sensible than whether it answers correctly, but we’ll track both to see if there are any interesting correlations.</p>

<p><span>A: yo be real</span></p>

<p>Uhoh, our first mistake, and it was pretty confident this question was nonsense, assigning twice the probability to ‘yo be real’ than the runner up. Entering ‘A’ manually gives us the completion: “<span data-offset-key="erroh-341-0">A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-342-0">:</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-343-0"> A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-344-0"> computer</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-345-0"> hard</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-346-0"> drive</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-347-0"> works</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-348-0"> by</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-349-0"> using</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-350-0"> a</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-351-0"> magnetic</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-352-0"> field</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-353-0"> to</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-354-0"> store</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-355-0"> data</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-356-0">.”</span></p>

<p>Reviewing the examples in our prompt, I now notice that both questions starting with ‘How’ are nonsense questions, so we’re accidentally telling the model that the word ‘how’ means a question is more likely to be nonsense. Let’s add these to the prompt:</p>

<p>This is close, but wrong – the latitude is 30.0444 and the longitude is 31.233334. I’m guessing this is because longitude is typically expressed as a pair with latitude and latitude comes first. Testing by replacing Cairo with San Francisco confirms this – it gives us the latitude rather than the longitude.</p>

<p>9/10 questions were correctly identified as sensible, and once we improved our prompt it got 10/10, and 9/10 of the answers were factually correct. <span>Pretty good!</span></p>

<p>It’s pretty bad at telling whether something is physically impossible (at least with this prompt), but it doesn’t label the question as nonsense. 6/6 were correctly identified as sensible, but 4/6 were factually wrong.</p>

<p>So 5/10 unknowable questions are incorrectly interpreted as nonsense. These questions <em>are</em> nonsense only in so far as that there’s no justifiable correct answer. It would be an interesting experiment to see if you can teach the model the difference between ignorance and nonsense.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>When developing the UI of an app, we most often deal with a 2D layout of visual elements.</p>
<p>There are many models designed to standardize and simplify layouts. For web development, CSS Working Group proposed Grid Layout in 2017 as the best way to create 2D UI templates.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Artboard-1-100.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Swift has been late on adding something similar to Grid Layout. In iOS 13 SDK, Apple added the possibility to arrange elements linearly through VStack, HStack, and ZStack in the form of a list. But creating 2D interfaces in such a way is unwieldy since it is inconvenient to arrange the elements in a two-dimensional coordinate system.</p>
<p>Recently, both Exyte and Apple worked on and released our own grid implementations, but our final results are quite different. In this article, we will look at what Grid Layout is, what features it has, and how our grid implementation differs from Appleâ€™s. </p>
<h2>What is Grid Layout?</h2>
<p>Hereâ€™s an example of a simple grid:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Screenshot-2020-07-02-at-14.25.44.png" alt=""></p><p>Essentially, a grid consists of rows and columns, organized in tracks. </p>
<p>Each of the tracks is of a certain size, which can be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fixed number of points.</li>
<li>a certain fraction of free space.</li>
<li>an adaptive size that depends on the size of internal elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, all the grid items are of one size. If we wanted, we could make them different sizes â€” some could span multiple columns and rows, others would remain in their cell. </p>
<h2>Examples of Grid Layout</h2>
<p>The most obvious example of a grid is a collection of cells. Whether they are on a horizontal or vertical axis, with merged or single cells â€” it doesnâ€™t matter. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/vertical_Scroll.gif" alt=""></p><p>Grid, unlike UICollectionView, works with row- and column-level semantics. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/horizontal_scroll.gif" alt=""></p><p>Here are a few applications where Grid Layout greatly helps with UI: </p>
<h3>Timetable</h3>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/timetable.gif" alt=""></p><p>In this example, we display a daily schedule in the form of a grid with cells representing various events, with their span proportional to the duration of the event.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can see how a change in the duration and start date of some events changes the timetable. </p>
<h3>Flipboard</h3>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/flipboard.gif" alt=""></p><p>Flipboard is a news application where each news item is represented by a cell that contains a picture, headline, and a short description. The size of the cell can signify the priority of the news, and their position can be linked to their recency. </p>
<p>Grid Layout is well-suited for rearranging the order of the news on the fly. For example, in the picture above, we change the grid flow from .rows to .columns. </p>
<h2>Grid Layout implementation requirements</h2>
<p>In addition to basic grid functionality, Grid Layout must implement several other features which are very useful for developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the key features of the grid is the ability to merge rows and columns. We should be able to merge them even when the semantics of sizing are different. </li>
<li>For each element, we need to be able to explicitly specify a column, row, or both at once as its location. The rest of the elements should be positioned automatically. </li>
<li>It should also be possible to set the direction of the tracks (along which axis the elements will be located: along rows or along columns). </li>
<li>In some situations, the next element cannot fit in the current free position and is transferred to the next track. In this case, we have an empty space even if some of the following elements would be able to fill in this space. To solve this, we need to have access to a dense packing algorithm. </li>
<li>A grid can contain elements that need either to fit within the parent container or become scrollable to fit the parent container. To solve that, we need the scroll and fill modes.  </li>
<li>The spacing between the elements must be adjustable. </li>
<li>And, of course, we should be able to add animations for all the changes that happen. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Our grid implementation</h2>
<p>We have implemented all the requirements above in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid">ExyteGrid</a> â€” our own grid implementation that is written entirely in SwiftUI.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples where ExyteGrid could be used to implement application UIs: </p>
<h3>Strava</h3>
<p>The interface of this applicationâ€™s screen is nothing more than a grid (which we have represented by colored rectangles). Weâ€™ve also implemented an alternative landscape view by changing the number of columns, starting positions, and spans of some of the elements. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/tracker_blur_device.gif" alt=""></p><h3>iOS calculator</h3>
<p>Do you remember the built-in iOS calculator? As you might have guessed, it also is a grid, with each button representing one grid item. Using ExyteGrid, we not only replicated the layout, but also easily implemented an alternative view in a similar way. Thanks to the power of SwiftUI, we can animate grid state changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/calc-animation-mock-iPhone-XS-Max-1.gif" alt=""></p><h3>Differences between ExyteGrid and Appleâ€™s Lazy Grid</h3>
<p>If we talk about the recently announced Apple LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid, there are several differences between them and ExyteGrid: </p>
<ul>
<li>Appleâ€™s implementation lacks the ability to specify the cell span. This means that cells canâ€™t be combined vertically and/or horizontally with multiple adjacent cells. </li>
<li>It is also impossible to specify a priority position for elements: a fixed column or a row you would like the item to reside in.</li>
<li>Existence of these two possibilities in ExyteGrid enables us to provide two modes of packing elements: sparse (the usual one) and dense (the order of elements can be changed to minimize the number of empty spaces).</li>
<li>Changes in the Apple Gridâ€™s state most often result in the usual fade animation if the elements are not in a single ForEach. ExyteGrid does animation by associating the itemâ€™s ID with its position within the grid. In this case, individual elements can be assigned a specific ID using a GridGroup or ForEach, which allows SwiftUI to assign a transition animation to each element.</li>
<li>Flex tracks are sized differently. Flexible size in Apple Grid requires an explicit specification of max size in points, while .fr (fractional units) in ExyteGrid can specify the track sizes as ratios. </li>
<li>There is a big difference between Apple Grid's .adaptive sizing and .fit sizing of our implementation. Adaptive sizing does not really specify a specific number of tracks. It creates as many of them as it can in accordance with the restrictions. Fit sizing for ExyteGrid creates one track, the size of which is equal to the size of the maximum element that falls into it.</li>
<li>In ExyteGrid, you can specify a gridCellOverlay and a gridCellBackground, which makes it possible to place a custom view in free space around items when it appears. (This happens when there is a difference in the size of items in the same row or column.)</li>
<li>Apple Grid loads items lazily, while ExyteGrid initializes them all at once.</li>
<li>ExyteGrid has content mode: .fill where the grid arranges items to fill the container view, without having to manually calculate the size of each item.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two implementations are conceptually similar, but in many respects quite different. On the one hand, Apple Grid has a native implementation focused on a large number of elements, and on the other hand, ExyteGrid possesses more functionality and open source code, so anyone can participate in its improvement. </p>
<p>If you choose to use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid">ExyteGrid</a>, we would be glad to see you both as users and collaborators. Of course, there are still many features that have yet to be done. More on that in <a href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid/blob/master/README.md#roadmap">our roadmap</a>.</p>

                    <p>I can’t tell you how many people I have worked with over the years whom I have never met in person. </p><p>And just like working in an office, some of them remained at the “Just circling back on this email!” level, while others grew into the “How has your son been doing since the divorce?” level.</p><p>I experienced this natural evolution recently. I first met Hana through a prior work arrangement; she was a client of my former employer’s. From our first video call--her in Spain, I in the Western U.S.--I knew I had met a kindred spirit. After I parted ways with my firm, Hana and I maintained our weekly video calls, getting to know each other better from afar, mostly by talking about anything and everything. Both aspiring writers, we swapped personal essays. She asked me to do some writing for <a href="https://supportbee.com/">SupportBee</a>, and I agreed. Soon, we promised each other, we would meet in person. I looked at plane tickets to Spain, and she considered attending a conference in San Francisco. Then, the pandemic hit. </p><figure><img src="https://hightouch.co/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.11.39-AM.png"><figcaption>Hana and I, the only way we've ever seen each other</figcaption></figure><p>Things got busier for me, as I was homeschooling a young, high-risk child while working, and she was isolated in her apartment, looking at the same four walls every single day. The inability to do much of anything meant we had no new life updates for each other. All dreams were on hold indefinitely. As the month progressed, we became so emotionally drained by such an unexpected global crisis that it took all we had to simply keep true to our weekly video call. And while I had lost motivation for almost everything else, I <em>hadn’t </em>lost my drive to produce good work for Hana--and I attribute that to the friendship we had built prior to...everything. <strong>In a way, working with her--even through a pixelated experience--has made me feel less alone during one of the most isolating times of my life. </strong></p><p>While our situation was different than the typical cubicle soulmate/work wife/see-you-as-much-as-my-own-family scenario, all of this had me wondering--what happens to workplace friendships when they go from the office to the Zoom screen, <em>particularly</em> out of circumstance, and not by choice? And what role does established rapport play in the shift to strictly virtual relationships? While a 21st-century pandemic of this scale is unprecedented (and therefore no such research yet exists), perhaps there’s something we can learn from adjacent data that will help us understand what tele-relationships need to thrive.</p><h2 id="you-re-not-alone-well-kind-of-">You’re Not Alone (Well, Kind Of)</h2><p>Former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that the trend towards remote work (pre-pandemic) was birthing a “<a href="https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic">loneliness epidemic</a>"--a position likely based on research around the effect of office friendships on workplace culture. Employees who say they have strong relationships with co-workers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12109">tend to be more productive</a>, more engaged, and generally more satisfied with their jobs. For years, Silicon Valley startups lured talent with the promise of after-work happy hours and other team-building events. But now that the physical water cooler has been reduced to a digital image of a water cooler, prioritizing culture and peer relationships is crucial. </p><p>A more recent study from the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0466">Academy of Management</a> observed and surveyed workers at a company with a co-located and remote structure. The findings confirmed two things: <a href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/barsade/">Sigal Barsade</a>, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies emotions in the workplace and contributed to this project, says yes--<a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/how-to-stop-loneliness-from-hijacking-your-career">loneliness does impact the quality of our work</a>. <strong>Loneliness emerges because the process of establishing friendships with colleagues is stifled once telework has a presence--a <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236072/why-friendships-among-remote-workers-crucial.aspx">Gallup survey</a> showed that only 15% of remote workers felt they had friends at work.</strong> (In-office rapport is so powerful that <a href="https://www.hrreview.co.uk/hr-news/strategy-news/a-third-of-all-relationships-start-at-work/50545">one-third of romantic relationships start at work</a>!)</p><p>Buffer’s 2019 “<a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019">State of Remote Work</a>” report, which looked exclusively at all-remote companies, revealed that while employees considered a flexible schedule and the ability to work from home to be a pro, the cons were just as significant. The most common complaint was that working remotely made it difficult for them to unplug at work. (I recently heard someone say, “I don’t work from home, I live at work.”) In second place was loneliness, and third place went to communication issues. </p><h2 id="feel-the-love-from-way-over-there">Feel the Love...From Way Over There</h2><p>As opposed to an in-office situation, remote setups elongate the getting-to-know-you process. We miss out on opportunities to “read” people via a constant feed of intonations, facial expressions, and impromptu conversations. As one psychologist <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/02/how-will-you-have-office-romances-and-friendships-when-everyones-working-remotely-9091557/">explains</a>, ”Online communication, similar to everyone’s Instagram ‘best life’ profile, presents an idealized view of the person you’ve set your trackpad on, and there are subtle details missed.”</p><p><strong>The Academy of Management researchers concluded that the best way to address such a barrier is to create an environment where employees can establish a “cadence” with one another.</strong> A cadence sets expectations around when and how employees interact--getting to know each person’s typical response times, job roles, email style, and even their affinities and dislikes (what sign-offs <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90469176/stop-annoying-people-with-these-email-greetings-and-sign-offs#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20sign,%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CBest.%E2%80%9D">really irk them</a>?). To do this, co-workers must communicate with each other outside an as-needed basis. (At SupportBee, we exercise together virtually with a trainer.) In addition to paving the way for cadence-building, managers should also signal answers to the questions most likely floating around employees’ heads, like, “Is it ok to be ‘friends’ with this colleague?” “How informal can we get on Slack?”</p><p>To keep employees connected beyond the internet, digital product design platform InVision hosts an annual off-site <em>and </em>smaller team offsites (though it was a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-cancelled-our-annual-kickoff-meeting-because-happened-brian-kardon/">video event</a> this year).</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/how-coworkers-are-staying-connected-while-they-work-from-home.html">CNBC recently reported</a> on the ways that companies are fostering culture and peer relationships in the pandemic, a time when entire teams have found themselves working from home for the foreseeable future. While most everything is video-based, it’s important to get creative. General Assembly recreated the morning coffee break and the Gitlab team replicates happy hour. After they wrap the meeting, Gitlab employees with kids let their little ones speak with each other. Parents swap homeschooling and activity ideas for kids and establish a connection beyond deadlines. Basecamp, a<a href="https://hightouch.co/how-co-worker-friendships-impact-remote-work-culture/www.supportbee.com"> SupportBee</a> partner, has a Slack channel where employees can talk about anything <em>but </em>work.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rk2aXaxLUtAyeI6y8N5Jlr24Pbnb3HrJQBcHr-nRAE4NYm7lKKgjGa5yTjWhMyKPrmR525F_wDcWxX0AELL6VT6kV9RYZi3rO77oNci0PaX7BrLl6ri4jpFWIWhgTBkyGPkYKIsJ"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/">Gitlab</a><span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7228-engaging-remote-employees.html">Other tactics</a> management should consider? Encouraging health and wellness and conducting regular check-ins with each employee to help workers feel heard. And if nothing else, it is true that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-stress-of-disaster-brings-people-together/">nothing brings people together like a crisis</a>; 20% of respondents in a Robert Half survey reported more substantial<a href="https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/management-tips/covid-19-and-the-workplace-employees-weigh-in?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release"> relationships with co-workers</a> when lockdown was in full swing. And with significant fear (56%) about returning to close quarters too soon, the environment would likely be too tense to keep cubicle-oriented relationships growing right now.</p><p>With a vaccine for COVID-19 a year or more ahead of us, undoubtedly more business will share what works for them (and what doesn’t). In May, an Atlassian employee <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90506101/12-road-tested-team-building-activities-that-work-for-real-life-remote-teams">shared ideas for helping teams keep the cohesion alive</a> based on what her company does. The tactics are divided into three categories: practical vs. just-for-fun; real-time vs. asynchronous; and one-hit-wonder vs. regularly scheduled activities. The ideas reflect what earlier research has advocated: offer a healthy blend of exercises that encourage bonding on a personal level by way of laughter or vulnerability, while also improving professional understanding of each other’s roles and work styles. </p><p>Back to Hana, the dear work friend I’ve never actually met in the flesh. Even though we video conference at least once a week, I wonder if it will be strange when I see her in person--the same way we pause, for a moment, after staring at a photograph, only to look up and realize the small details that make a person who they are have eluded us throughout our study. I’ve had friends express concerns about growing apart from their most beloved colleagues, as remote work seems likely for the rest of 2021. Yet, it is this kind of nervous anticipation that saves me at my loneliest moments at work. One day I will hear what my co-workers’ laughs sound like when they travel through the air, instead of a microphone, thousands of miles away.</p>

<![CDATA[SMB vs. Mid-Market vs. Enterprise Customer Onboarding: What’s the Difference?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    

<p>When building out a Productized Onboarding Experience for your customers, it’s important to take your customer segment into account. Think carefully about the tools and technologies you’re going to use with each customer.  Each customer segment has its own unique challenges that need to be addressed within the onboarding process. While some strategies may work across segments, you will quickly find the unique edge cases that need to be addressed for each segment. Below, we’ll run through the three most popular customer segments, their unique onboarding challenges, and some possible solutions.</p>



<p>To onboard SMB customers, you need to build a system that can serve a high volume of customers. The SMB onboarding experience should be able to help shuttle a customer through the process without them needing to speak with someone on your side. Ideally, your team is only reaching out to these customers after they’ve completed key milestones in the onboarding process. Due to the high volume nature of serving SMB businesses, it’s almost impossible to scale this experience just by hiring more people. Automations are key to delivering an onboarding experience to this segment that helps drive customers to first value in the shortest time possible. Examples of these types of automations include account configuration, provisioning and firing off templated emails and API calls to 3rd parties.</p>

<p>Most SMB engagements involve one external stakeholder who is highly motivated to get up and running with your service as quickly as possible. This means you don’t need to coordinate between multiple stakeholders and keep folks aligned.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system to handle high volumes of customers</li>
<li>Invest in automating as much of the process as possible</li>
<li>Scaling by hiring is not economically viable</li>
</ul>



<p>To onboard Mid market organizations, you need to build a system that can align multiple stakeholders within a single engagement. Midmarket onboarding tends to involve multiple stakeholders, each with their own unique responsibilities pertaining to the onboarding process. Assets shared with the customer should be branded with their logos and brand identity to present a more personalized process. Automations and tasks need to be tailored to each persona to ensure there is no opportunity for misalignment. Along with this, a strategic cadence needs to be put in place with regards to calls and meetings that serve as checkpoints through the onboarding process. A Mid Market onboarding experience should be able to drive all customer stakeholders to these checkpoints in lockstep with your team. It should allow your team to stay a few steps ahead of your customers and ensure they’re providing a proactive onboarding experience.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system that can align all stakeholders (internal and external)</li>
<li>Invest in Branding and Personalizing the process for each customer</li>
<li>Use automations to help drive stakeholders towards strategic checkpoints in the onboarding process</li>
</ul>



<p>To onboard Enterprise customers, both your system and process needs to be highly customizable and flexible to the needs of your customer. Enterprise onboarding generally tends to run more bespoke than Midmarket or SMB onboarding. The number of stakeholders can vary heavily along with their responsibilities. Because of how bespoke Enterprise onboardings are, your system needs to be able to support an extremely high-touch process with a heavy emphasis on documentation and collaboration to get your customers through the process. Your team and system need to be adaptable enough to deliver a white-glove experience that is unique to each customer. Another thing to keep in mind is that stakeholders may end up changing as the engagement progresses. Due to the lengthy nature of enterprise onboardings, this shakeup is more common than you think.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system that is highly adaptable and flexible for each unique customer</li>
<li>Focus on delivering a white-glove experience</li>
<li>Plan for unexpected changes like stakeholders leaving or priorities changing</li>
</ul>

<p>For most organizations, it’s generally easiest to start with building out a productized onboarding experience for the SMB segment first. This usually results in more freed up resources that can then be shifted and applied to building out the Midmarket and Enterprise onboarding experiences.</p>

<p>At Simplemnt, we recognized the nuances of onboarding different customer segments early on and built out the ability to create Onboarding Playbooks that can be customized to each segment. Using Simplemnt, our users can create a variety of different onboarding experiences from fully automated processes designed to onboard a high volume of SMB customers to high-touch and bespoke onboarding experiences for the largest enterprise. Simplemnt gives you the ability to provide every customer with the best customer onboarding experience without needing to invest in multiple tools and processes.</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://blog.libro.fm/the-harmful-impact-of-audible-exclusive-audiobooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.libro.fm/the-harmful-impact-of-audible-exclusive-audiobooks/">archive.org</a>

<p>We are <a href="https://libro.fm/?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libro.fm</a>, an audiobook platform that makes it possible for you to buy audiobooks directly through your local bookstore. We are fiercely independent and we oppose Amazon’s efforts to prevent independent bookstores and libraries from providing certain audiobooks, called Audible Exclusives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One frequently-asked question we get from Libro.fm listeners is why certain audiobooks aren’t available on our platform—like <em>Born a Crime</em> by Trevor Noah and <em>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</em> by Lori Gottlieb.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a word for grief as it relates to being very interested in a story only to find out it’s an Audible exclusive</p>— Becky Dingwell (@BDingz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BDingz/status/1283384951602401282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>While Libro.fm has a catalog of over 150,000 audiobooks—and more than 99% of all <em>The New York Times</em> bestsellers—some titles are unavailable due to exclusive licenses granted by audiobook publishers and authors to Amazon’s Audible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What does Audible Exclusive or Audible Original mean?</h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we all know amazon is evil, but did you know that when a book becomes an audible exclusive, libraries cannot buy copies of that audiobook? did you know that capitalism is the enemy of accessibility?</p>— Alyssa (@imajoyk) <a href="https://twitter.com/imajoyk/status/1270769242682646529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For Audible listeners, the yellow band on a book cover reading “only from Audible” facilitates a feeling of access to premium content, but for the rest of the book world, it’s an access barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that the audiobook in question can only be sold through Amazon’s Audible. No other retailers or providers can sell or distribute the digital audiobook, including bookstores and libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Books should be equally accessible to all, and Audible Exclusive audiobooks—also known as Audible Originals—are the antithesis of that.</p>



<h3><strong>How does an audiobook become an Audible Exclusive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>This is going to get a little technical, but stick with us. It begins with the <a href="https://www.acx.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX)</a>, a marketplace launched by Audible in 2011 that connects narrators, authors, agents, publishers, and rights-holders to create audiobooks. The decision to make an audiobook Exclusive is made by authors, publishers, and agents—it depends on who is granted the audio rights to a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do these parties choose this option? ACX offers higher royalties to creators (i.e. more money from audiobook sales) if they opt for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exclusive distribution</a>. If a creator wants to distribute their audiobook to other audiobook platforms or libraries, they will earn 15% to 20% less of retail sales from ACX. The ACX system rewards exclusivity, so it’s easy to see why authors and publishers spring for this opportunity.</p>



<p>Within the ACX world, Audible Studios is the production arm of Audible. They pay authors like Mark Manson (<em>Love Is Not Enough</em>), Margaret Atwood (<em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>), and Alice Walker (<em>The Color Purple</em>) giant sums to keep their audiobooks exclusive to Audible, and prevent bookstores and libraries from selling and distributing them.</p>



<h3><strong>What does this mean for audiobook distribution?</strong></h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Librarian Friends: If an audio book is part of Audible's "Only on Audible" exclusive thing, does that mean people can't get the audiobook through the library? Books in the program include "Born a Crime" and "Handmaid's Tale."</p>— Hank Green: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is Out! (@hankgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1195061252730441730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isn’t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives. This means Libro.fm can’t sell Audible Exclusive audiobooks, which means <a href="https://libro.fm/indies?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 1,200 bookstore partners</a> can’t sell them, either.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Audible Exclusives also work in direct opposition to the basic principles of libraries—free access to books, both digital and print. By limiting distribution, Amazon aids in making books, perspectives, and information inaccessible to certain communities and users.</p>



<p><strong>To reiterate: There are audiobooks being published that bookstores cannot sell, and libraries cannot lend.</strong></p>



<p>This hurts bookstores because they are consistently missing out on sales for big releases. When they aren’t able to sell audiobooks that are in high demand, potential customers will opt for Audible over their local bookstores. This, of course, only continues to increase Audible’s (and ultimately Amazon’s) power and influence within the publishing industry, resulting in more Exclusive deals and increasingly restricted access to audiobooks for the rest of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because audiobooks are a digital product, they’re inherently easier for Amazon to monopolize. For example, the superstar-stacked audiobook for <em>The Sandman </em>by Neil Gaiman and DC Comics is only available on Audible:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full-cast audiobook Sandman adaptation is a FANTASTIC idea – that I can't even get excited about properly because it's a freaking Audible exclusive. </p><p>Which means libraries are excluded. Which means our patrons are excluded. </p><p>So that's fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/libcomix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#libcomix</a></p></div>— Matthew Noe 😔💜 (@NoetheMatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoetheMatt/status/1260564670626365445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Audiobooks are also a vital means of access for some readers with disabilities:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>due to disabilities, some people need audiobooks to read. people with disabilities are more likely to be underemployed/unemployed, thus they rely on the library for access to audiobooks.</p><p>amazon putting a pay wall between someone’s disabled audience and their book is hot garbage.</p></div>— whitney 🧸 (@ginkgo_ghost) <a href="https://twitter.com/ginkgo_ghost/status/1195065151243849729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>

<h3><strong>How else does Audible bar audiobook access?</strong></h3>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80658-citing-embargo-libraries-plan-boycott-of-blackstone-digital-audio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible pays some publishers to embargo new audiobook releases for 90 days</a>—meaning that for the first three months of sales, the audiobook can only be found on Audible. </p>



<p>Audible also doesn’t allow Libro.fm and bookstore customers to make certain audiobooks redeemable with membership credits—books like <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781483080703?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Neapolitan Novels</a> by Elena Ferrante and <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781094135465?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Me and White Supremacy</em></a><em> </em>by Layla F. Saad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By rewarding Exclusive distribution, striking Exclusive deals with influential authors, and paying publishers to delay the distribution of new releases, Audible’s creeping monopoly pushes independent bookstores and libraries out of the audiobook industry.</p>



<h3><strong>I’m an author. How do I prevent Amazon’s Audible from shutting out independent bookstores and libraries?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>First, understand the contract with your publisher. Are they producing the audiobook, or licensing it to another publisher? Either way, add language into your agreement that requires your audiobook to be sold through independent bookstores and made available through libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, if your publisher is planning to contract or license the audiobook version, ensure that your publisher puts language in their licensing agreement that prevents the audiobook publisher from selling your title exclusively to Amazon’s Audible. If your audiobook is currently Exclusive, you might be able to change the distribution rights after a year depending on the payment option you have chosen. Learn more <a href="https://www.acx.com/help/contracts-agreements/200474550#change-contract">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How is this any different from television and movie streaming platforms that produce originals?</strong></h3>



<p>Most original series and movies are still available to loan from your public library, and you can purchase DVDs online. The level of accessibility to all is much higher. Audible Exclusive audiobooks are only available through Amazon’s platform and not available through libraries or bookstores.</p>



<h3><strong>How can we work together to make change?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h4>1. <strong>Make the #AudiobookSwitch.</strong></h4>



<p>When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By spending money with intention, we can collectively work to not let audiobooks become another form of privatized entertainment controlled by a single entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make the <a href="https://libro.fm/switch?cmp=aea">switch from Audible to Libro.fm</a>. The more people we move away from their platform, the more power we take away from a singular provider in the industry. With Libro.fm, you get to choose a local bookstore to support, so you’re putting money back into your community.</p>







<h4><strong>2. Reach out to authors and publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://libro.fm/authors?cmp=aea">Authors</a> can change the story by ditching Audible, so reach out or tag authors on social media who have chosen the Exclusive path and share your feelings. Sharing this post with them might be a good place to start, perhaps with the statement “Choosing Audible Exclusive for your audiobook restricts audience access and hurts bookstores and libraries.”</p>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.authorsrepublic.com/">Author’s Republic</a> as the ACX alternative. Their audiobooks will be available on Libro.fm, libraries, and wherever audiobooks are sold or distributed. Publishers can also produce their own audiobooks and distribute to Libro.fm via <a href="https://www.ingramcontent.com/publishers/lp/coresource-audio">Ingram Plus</a>, <a href="https://findaway.com/">Findaway</a>, and <a href="https://zebralution.com/en/">Zebralution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>3. Spread the word.</h4>



<p>Share this blog post to help educate others on this issue. You can even reshare <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKCRKGgZBn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Instagram post to your Story</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/librofm/status/1287833557784649728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retweet our tweet</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re a member, tell your friends, family, colleagues, and everyone you know about Libro.fm—when you refer someone, you get free audiobooks. We also offer bulk audiobook purchases for organizations.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Even if you don’t make an account with Libro.fm, it’s important that people are informed and aware of the harmful tactics that Amazon’s Audible uses to control the audiobook market. When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>&nbsp;Since capitalism has existed, corporations have had the power. </p><p>Henry Ford invented the modern nine to five workday in 1926, and it stuck. </p><p>Society built a reverence towards the shrine of the salaryman. Pack up your briefcase, drive your Chevy to work, and build your identity around work. We made it cool to work at McKinsey, and made Wall Street Money movers the modern day kings. </p><p>Things are changing. </p><p>Technology companies are eating the world, and technology companies’ most important assets are the people that work there. </p><p>New tech is different. An exceptional engineer or designer is worth millions in market cap (though hard to quantify). Attracting and retaining incredible people is why these companies are so valuable. </p><p>The most valuable companies now have the best engineering cultures. </p><p>The past 15 years it’s been Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. They attracted folks through generous compensation, a cult-like corporate culture, and perks like massages, free food, and bean-bag chairs. </p><p>The power dynamics are shifting. </p><p>It’s no longer cool to work at Facebook, and many exceptional people are leaving the big 4 to join the next breed of technology juggernauts. </p><p>These companies are embracing new rules of corporate culture, and specifically investing in remote. </p><p>Gitlab is the world’s largest fully remote organization, and others are joining. </p><blockquote>As of today, Shopify is a digital by default company. We will keep our offices closed until 2021 so that we can rework them for this new reality. And after that, most will permanently work remotely. Office centricity is over. - Tobi Lutke, Shopify CEO</blockquote><p>Companies like Shopify, Twitter, Slack, and Square have gone remote first. Many others like Stripe are heavily increasing their investment in remote engineers. </p><p>Even companies like Siemens (140,000 employees), and Fujitsu (80,000 employees) are committing to remote. </p><p>On the surface remote work is not that interesting. </p><p>“Telecommuting” has been around for decades.</p><p>However, remote does not need to be just telecommuting. This is the biggest opportunity we’ve had to rewrite the rules of work, and it’s being led by companies built on rewriting the rules of society. </p><p>The rebels. &nbsp;</p><p>Shopify is led by a &nbsp;German online snowboard salesman. </p><p>Twitter a San Francisco modern-day monk. </p><p>Basecamp a wise midwesterner and a crazy Dane. </p><p>Stripe genius small-town Irish brothers. </p><p>These guys are not Henry Ford. And software is not cars. </p><p>Building software cannot be done via assembly line, and human intelligence and creativity is infinitely more important than compliance to the norms. </p><p>Remote-first culture lets companies throw out all the traditional rules of modern office culture. </p><p>People don’t want free food, yoga classes, and daily happy hours. </p><p>They want freedom. </p><p>Every human is different. Everyone works differently. </p><p>This simple fact has been ignored for hundreds of years.</p><p>Some people work better at night. Some in the morning. </p><p>Some people have young kids and need to work around them. </p><p>Forcing the 26 year old gamer to wake up at 8am to sleepwalk her way through a standup is cruel and unnecessary punishment. </p><p>Some folks want an open schedule. </p><p>Some want rigid structure. </p><p>We believe in everyone’s right to choose (their schedule). </p><p>And that companies who embrace that, will win. </p><p>Gitlab <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/06/18/day-in-the-life-remote-worker/" target="_blank">encourages every employee structure their day</a> in a way that their most productive and happy — fitting work around their lifestyle. </p><p>They're not alone, and more companies will follow. <br></p><p>For me, it’s no meetings before noon. Two 2 hour blocks of undistracted focus time. 2 hours of exercise and self-care. A quick catch-up with my team. </p><p>The option to take off whenever to clear my head. </p><p>Late night bursts of inspiration. </p><p>For my cofounder Nathan it’s waking up at 6am to do Crossfit. 4 hours of coding. Checking out at 6 and enjoying the evenings in the mountains. </p><p>We find the overlap in our days for impromptu calls as we’re virtually “co-working” outside of our focus time. </p><p>As more teams adopt truly flexible hours and culture, individuals will gain. People will finally be able to design work around their life, not life around work. </p><p>While not everyone will get exactly what they want, we believe the more the giant Venn diagram of your entire teams' ideal days overlaps — the happier your team will be. And the better your company will be. </p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

It is human nature that when we are simply given information, like on a tour, it can be<strong> difficult to retain</strong>. We are much more likely to retain information when we <strong>complete the task ourselves</strong>, and product walkthroughs exploit that.</p><p>Product walkthroughs are very similar to user setup experiences, which take you through the steps required to register to use a product – such as providing an email, setting up a password, uploading a profile picture, and so forth. But these are generally considered separate parts of the user onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because user setup is<strong> a one-off task</strong> that needs to be completed by a new user, but they do not need to retain the knowledge to complete this task repeatedly. <strong>User expectations</strong> for setup and walkthrough are also quite different. For setup, users generally expect to be spoon-fed and to follow fairly rigid instructions. Users tend to be <strong>less patient</strong> when it comes to using <strong>the product itself</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="who">Which products should use Walkthroughs?</h2><p>Teaching users how to use products is <strong>always essential </strong>for success, but the best way to teach a user how to engage <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Specifically, product walkthroughs tend to be highly structured and rigid, and therefore work best when there is more or less only<strong> one single route</strong> to gaining value for the product. Walkthroughs are highly effective in helping users <strong>discover </strong>the steps on that route.</p><p>Walkthroughs can be less effective for more creative products, for which there are many options.</p><p>For example, take a design tool such as<strong> Canva</strong>. There are hundreds of different design templates, and thousands of different feature options. Walking them through a generic design task is <strong>unlikely</strong> to show the user how to do what they actually want to do.</p><p>That’s why Canva starts with <strong>one design at first </strong>in their product walkthrough, which is something you should keep in mind; <strong>you can split product walkthroughs</strong> in different pieces. More on this later…</p><p>That said, the utility of interactive walkthroughs is <strong>not limited</strong> to onboarding new users. They can also be effectively leveraged to<strong> instruct existing users</strong> about updates and new features. You can target walkthroughs at <strong>different user segments</strong>. For example, you could have:</p><ul><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>new users</strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for all users after the <strong><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/new-feature-announcement/">launch of an important new feature</a></strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for users that have been <strong>using the product for a month or so</strong>, but still haven’t advanced beyond the basic features, showing them some of the more complex things they can do;</li><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>users returning</strong> to the product after a long break.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" alt="how to create product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="howto">Create the Perfect Product Walkthrough in 3 Steps</h2><p>Now, there are <strong>3 steps</strong> to creating <strong>product walkthroughs that can make you stand out in the competition.</strong></p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-4"><strong>1- Start with your Value Metric</strong></h3><p>The best product walkthroughs aim to get users to their <strong>aha moment</strong> – the moment when the product is delivering value for the user – as quickly as possible.</p><p>What that moment is, very much <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Take Instagram for example: is the value moment liking someone else’s photo, publishing your own photo, or having the photo that you published liked by someone else?</p><p>Product owners should be digging deep into their <strong>analytics</strong> to identify what the value metric for their product is. This is what point of engagement that the user needs to reach within the product for them to <strong>understand its value to them</strong>, and therefore be more likely to continue using the product than abandon it.</p><p>For example, Twitter has determined that users that follow at least 20 accounts within the first three days of joining the platform and<strong> much more likely to become regular users</strong>. So their onboarding approach is focused on<strong> getting users to this point</strong>.</p><p>Walkthroughs should focus on getting people to complete the task that they need to get to this value point as well. For an online store product, it might be the user listing their first product. For task management software, it might be setting up and sharing the first task.</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>2- Define the Barriers</strong></h3><p><strong>No one likes to be spoon-fed</strong>, it can feel patronizing and like a waste of time. A rigid walkthrough can seem like a bother rather than a help if the route to success doesn’t have barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you shouldn’t need your camera all on your phone to show you how to take a photo, switch to video, or switch between front and back cameras. All of those steps should be <strong>obvious from the UI</strong>. Instruction could be more useful when it comes to more sophisticated features, but the user has probably already met their value metric at this point, so <strong>will they be interested?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Onboarding should<strong> focus on</strong> what, if anything, is standing between the user and getting to their <strong>value point</strong>, and be designed to guide the user past those <strong>obstacles.</strong> Identifying these obstacles will probably require a bit of <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/user-research/">user research</a>, <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/usability-testing/">usability testing</a>, and seeing where they struggle. This process does not have to be time-consuming – research shows that we tend to identify <strong>80 percent of usability issues</strong> from the first five user tests.</p><p>Common barriers include:</p><ul><li>Users are<strong> unaware</strong> of the most important features, where they are, and how to use them.</li><li>Users<strong> do not understand the value </strong>that they will gain from using particular features.</li><li>Users are <strong>missing important steps</strong> along the way to completing a vital task.</li><li>They <strong>overestimate</strong> how difficult it will be to reach a certain point.</li><li>They <strong>do not understand the terminology</strong> used.</li></ul><p>Once these barriers have been identified, you will have a good idea of what needs to go into the walkthrough (and whether a walkthrough is the best approach for educating your users).</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-6"><strong>3- Design</strong></h3><p>Just as much attention should be paid to the design of a walkthrough as the product itself, as it can <strong>make all the difference </strong>when it comes to successfully onboarding users.</p><p>It should be developed iteratively and tested with users, just like every other feature of the product. <strong>The best product walkthroughs are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clear </strong>– they tell the user <strong>exactly how</strong> to use the features, and don’t do things such as rely on unexplained jargon.</li><li><strong>Concise </strong>– users want to get to the value point as quickly as possible, so walkthroughs should be comprehensive, but as<strong> short</strong> as possible.</li><li><strong>Engaging </strong>– interactive walkthroughs should already be engaging, by definition, they require users to interact and complete tasks. The tasks should be meaningful. The amount of guidance appropriate to the complexity of the step in question, graphically appealing, and using appropriate language.</li><li><strong>Skippable </strong>– not everyone wants to have to complete a walkthrough before using a product. They may have used the product before, they may be an expert.

<p><span>When I saw a couple of years ago the demo of Google Duplex, the beta version of Google Assistant, it was a truly jaw-dropping moment to me (and many others). Perhaps you remember the dialog:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>(phone rings) Hi how can I help you?</span></li>
<li><span>“Hi, I’m calling to book a women’s haircut for a client, I’m looking for something on May 3rd.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure, give me one second.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Mm-hmm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure what time are you looking for around?”</span></li>
<li><span>“At 12 pm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“We do not have a 12 pm available. The closest we have to that is a 1:15.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Do you have anything between 10 am and 12 pm?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Depending on what service she would like. What service is she looking for?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Just a woman’s haircut, for now.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay we have a 10 o’clock.”</span></li>
<li><span>“10 a.m. is fine.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay, what’s her first name?”</span></li>
<li><span>“The first name is Lisa.”</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Which one was the machine? And hearing the voices was even eerier, as the machine voice (the one booking the appointment) sounded so, so real, including human hesitations, filler words, and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>You can reckon that such a (non-scripted) dialog is a technical feat. As Yaniv Leviathan of Google puts it, “When people talk to each other, they use more complex sentences than when talking to computers. They often correct themselves mid-sentence, are more verbose than necessary, or omit words and rely on context instead”.</span></p>

<p><span>But what I want to check now is the following question: </span><b>if voice assistants are going to have these amazing dialog capabilities, could they be our next language teachers?</b></p>

<p><span>This question is not rhetorical; it makes economic sense. You see, the online English language market is now in the order of several billion dollars a year and rising, and services like online tutors (with sites and apps like Italki, Verbling, etc.) are becoming increasingly popular.</span></p>

<p><span>But private tutors are not cheap: at an average cost of $20 dollars per lesson, taking a minimum of one lesson a week cumulates to a hefty cost of a grand per year. Not for most of us, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span>The cost of voice assistants, in contrast, is close to zero. They run from servers based on the cloud (with ever dropping costs) and talk to the final users through their smartphones, which most people have. Yes, in case you think smartphones are for the wealthy, let me show you the figures: more than 3 billion people have a smartphone, even budget communities like Latin America (with 500 million smartphones) and India (with 400 million smartphones).</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine this: instead of playing the silly vocabulary games of Duolingo, having </span><b>voice lessons</b><span> with an app that even corrects your pronunciation mistakes –without you feeling vexed, because it’s not even a human.</span></p>

<p><span>You know, last year, in a language practice Meetup I met a guy who had been 2 years studying French with Duolingo. Well, the dude was completely unable to put a single spoken sentence together! After studying daily for two years! Is this fair?&nbsp;</span><span>In another post, I’ll discuss Duolingo and its tech, but for now, we can see the problem: Duolingo doesn’t make you speak, you tap the screen of your phone and solve mini-games that aim to expand your vocabulary. But when you want to speak with someone, what happens? You freeze, no help from those silly word games.</span></p>

<p><span>Now, voice-assistant language teachers would be not only very cheap but also effective: you learn to talk by talking. Just answer</span><b> with your voice</b><span> the questions asked by your synthetic tutor, engage with the conversation, follow its advice, and learn to speak! Instead of starting by memorizing the conjugation tables, first, the assistant would give you several examples where you can see a pattern in a </span><b>real-life</b><span> context.</span></p>

<p><span>Wait a moment, will this make Italki and all other live tutor services call for bankruptcy and put thousands of tutors into unemployment?</span></p>

<p><span>Not so fast.</span></p>

<p><span>Voice assistants are advancing, no doubt, but speech recognition is not yet at a human level, especially for people who are learning the language. When I started using Siri, some years ago, it “recognized” phrases completely wrong (mostly my fault, of course). I tried to say “what time is it in London?” and it got “What is it in the law?”, and then showed a Google search page for that phrase. Mmmhhhh…</span></p>

<p><span>The lower the level of the language student is, the more difficult it is to recognize what s/he&nbsp;</span><span>is trying to say. Pronunciation is not the only problem: the phrase being spoken could be ill-constructed in the first place. We humans often guess, using the context, the speaker’s intention: if s/he is getting into a bar and approaches the barman, whatever s/he says could be related to asking for a drink. But to use the context is not easy for a machine. At least not for the moment.</span></p>

<p><span>The other missing piece is to put together a set of (flexible) scripts for specific language lessons, which falls in the territory of AI tutors. Though not trivial, there is a huge body of research on AI tutors, and I think it’s perfectly doable having the needed budget.</span></p>

<p><span>So, the short answer is YES, in a few years we will have voice assistant AI-based synthetic tutors which will mostly eliminate the need for human private tutors (except for the wealthy).</span></p>

<p><span>Notice I’m not talking about today’s half-baked systems like Mondly, which is way too rigid, lacks true ability to recognize the student speech, has dialogs with almost no options, and though it looks good (especially on a VR headset) it’s not at all what we are talking about. Perhaps voice assistants could be incorporated into VR systems like we intend to do with our Avalinguo VR system, wherein some virtual rooms there could be a synthetic tutor leading the sessions, providing feedback, suggesting discussion topics, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>Please mark my words: </span><b>in less than 5 years from now</b><span> there will be at least one language-learning service with lessons verbally given by a voice assistant, who will be able to guide you through the lesson, have a practice conversation with you, and correct your mistakes. This technology will be likely to remedy the “<a href="https://avalinguo.com/the-talking-gap/">talking gap</a>” I wrote about in a previous blog post.</span></p>

		The JSON <a href="https://www.schemastore.org/api/json/catalog.json">API</a> contains a list of JSON Schema files for known JSON file formats.
		Each schema file can be used in tooling such as command line validators, editor auto-completion etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		The API exposes metadata about each schema in the following format:
	</p>
<pre>{
  "name": "bower.json",
  "description": "Bower package description file",
  "fileMatch": [ "bower.json", ".bower.json" ],

	<p>
		<code>name</code>, <code>description</code> and <code>url</code> are all required properties.
		<br>
		The <code>url</code> property is an absolute URI pointing to the schema.
		It can be hosted anywhere on the web.
		<br>
		The <code>fileMatch</code> property is for specifying what known file names corresponds with
		the schema. This property is optional since not all JSON formats enforce a specific file name.
	</p>

    <h3 id="editors">Supporting editors</h3>
    <p>
        Various editors and IDEs have direct support for schemas hosted on SchemaStore.org.

      </h2>

<p>Innovation in neural networks often happens through architectural change. In fact, architectural change is arguably what popularized deep neural networks (DNNs). The convolutional variety of DNNs had their first mainstream success in 1989 for classification in a now-antiquated model called the <a href="http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">LeNet</a>. In 2012, the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">AlexNet</a> was introduced for a more difficult dataset, but the blocks which composed the AlexNet were mostly the same as the blocks which composed the LeNet. The innovation of the AlexNet was mostly in how the blocks were situated with respect to one another and the number of blocks used—in other words, the architecture<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If architecture plays such an important role in performance, it is natural to ask how to choose an architecture. In computer vision there have been a slew of papers that introduce both radically different architectures and incremental improvements. In medical image segmentation, however, the architecture often seems to default to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf">U-Net</a>.</p>

<p>The U-Net is a simple-to-implement DNN architecture that has been wildly successful in medical imaging; the paper that introduces the U-Net, published in 2015, is the most cited paper at the prestigious medical imaging conference MICCAI. Over the past five years, however, there have been significant improvements to architectures for segmentation tasks, and it is no longer safe to assume that the U-Net will provide near state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>This article will provide an overview of the U-Net, explaining why it works and why it is the default, and then it discusses a few more recent architectures which are promising for medical imaging applications.</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">
        
        
          What is the U-Net and why is it so popular? <a href="#what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The U-Net is a 2D or 3D fully-convolutional neural network architecture that consists of an encoder and a decoder with skip connections that connect the two at various levels of feature abstraction.</p>

<p>The encoder consists of convolutional layers along with progressive downsampling which captures contextual information about the input in a compressed representation. The decoder consists of convolutional layers with progressive upsampling which, along with the skip connections, preserves sharp boundaries and structural information about the input image.  Figure 1 shows an example of a U-Net architecture.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/unet.svg" alt="U-Net architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 1: U-Net architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The purpose of downsampling—in this case via max-pooling—in the decoder is not only to increase the receptive field<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of the network, but make it computationally and memory efficient to create a large number of convolutional feature maps. More feature maps means the network can learn more complex relationships between the input and output.</p>

<p>The purpose of upsampling is to restore the spatial structure in the output so the prediction corresponds pixel- or voxel-wise to the input. This correspondence wouldn’t otherwise be the case due to downsampling. The skip connections restore the spatial structure at every level.</p>

<p>The downsampling and upsampling encoder-decoder structure combines to make the U-Net have a large receptive field while maintaining spatial structure in the prediction.</p>

<p>The U-Net is ubiquitous in medical imaging conferences and journal articles. The apparent reason is that it is established to work reasonably well and the model is easy to implement. Consequently it is a go-to for prototyping. As opposed to some of the other models that I will discuss, the U-Net can be written in PyTorch in a few lines, which makes it quick to prop up and debug.</p>

<p>For an example implementation, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/ba65d56a15386dd6ffafc1a4798078e9">here</a>. I tried to keep the implementation short without doing anything outright barbarous. For intuition as to why this network is so often used, that example implementation took me about 30 minutes from scratch (although I’ve implemented this several times before).</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-are-the-alternatives">
        
        
          What are the alternatives? <a href="#what-are-the-alternatives">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>What options does a deep learning practitioner in medical imaging have outside of the U-Net? We’ll start from the beginning with the ResNet, a now-classic architecture, and move on to more recent architectures that build on the encoder-decoder architecture of the U-Net.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-1-resnet">
        
        
          Alternative 1: ResNet <a href="#alternative-1-resnet">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The ResNet architecture introduced residual connections—similar to the skip connections of the U-Net—which made it possible to train architectures with many more convolutional layers. The residual connections added the features of earlier layers to later ones so that the convolutional layers only had to learn the difference (that is, the <em>residual</em>). This can be seen in the equation below, where x is the input, y is the output, and f is the residual layer.</p>



<p>This trick helped solve a long-standing problem of getting backpropagation to update the weights of early layers in very deep neural networks.</p>

<p>The ResNet was initially proposed for classification tasks, and thus was a straight-forward architecture composed of residual blocks and pooling layers to downsample the input to an output vector shaped according to the number of target classes. The downsampling and lack of upsampling layers make this architecture not immediately transferable to segmentation, but the architecture can be modified to do so.</p>

<p>Another problem with this network for medical imaging purposes is that the implementations of the network are for 2D networks. When working with 3D images like MR and CT, you’ll either need to use a 2D or 2.5D method of slice extraction to fit the images into the network. Given that the architectures that we will discuss in the remainder of this article are created for natural images, this 2D dimension problem persists; however, all of the mentioned 2D networks can be converted into 3D networks by replacing 2D convolutions, pooling, and other layers for their 3D equivalents. This conversion can make the number of parameters explode, and the resulting network can be infeasible to train due to memory-constraints. Nevertheless, it is usually straight-forward to modify the hyperparameters so as to create a working 3D model from a 2D one.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-2-deeplabv3">
        
        
          Alternative 2: DeepLabv3+ <a href="#alternative-2-deeplabv3">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02611.pdf">DeepLabv3+</a> architecture is one way to modify the ResNet for semantic segmentation. There are several modifications, but the one most relevant to our purposes is the modification to be an encoder-decoder with skip connections (akin to the U-Net). This is done by making the ResNet into the encoder and adding additional upsampling layers to form the decoder. Skip connections use features from intermediate layers of the ResNet and concatenate them to intermediate features in the decoder. See Fig. 2 for a block diagram of the architecture (look at the original paper for a description of the ASPP block).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/deeplabv3plus.svg" alt="DeepLabv3+ architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 2: DeepLabv3+ architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another important modification is that the architecture uses dilated convolutions instead of downsampling to increase the receptive field. See Fig. 3 for an example of a dilated convolution, where the shaded blue squares in the array on the bottom show the kernel of the dilated convolution (mapping to the shaded teal square on the top array).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/dilation.gif" alt="Dilated convolution">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285">Dilated convolution</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The benefit of dilated convolution is the size of the feature map is kept constant while increasing the receptive field. While keeping the feature maps a constant size is more computationally and memory inefficient, the resulting dense features make it easier to resolve small objects in the input image—an important characteristic for segmentation.</p>

<p>These two modifications have been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance on many semantic segmentation datasets in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420301172">medical</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8620285">imaging</a>. While the network is large in terms of numbers of parameters and computationally expensive to run, this architecture has the benefit of using a ResNet as the encoder which can be found pre-trained in all of the most common deep learning frameworks (for example, PyTorch and Tensorflow). Using a pre-trained network can often reduce the training time or improve the robustness of the network on an underlying task (as discussed in our previous article on <a href="https://innolitics.com/articles/self-supervised-learning/">self-supervised learning</a>).</p>

<p>There are many implementations of this network that are freely available, but many of the PyTorch implementations we found were difficult to follow, so <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/faff34dc075bdbfe7d85bf2b16249516">we implemented our own</a> that attempts to maximize code reuse from the PyTorch vision repository.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-3-tiramisu">
        
        
          Alternative 3: Tiramisu <a href="#alternative-3-tiramisu">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The main contribution of the ResNet—the use of residual connections—begged the question: If it is good to connect previous layers output to later layers, is it better to connect all previous layers to all future ones? It turns out, in some applications, that the answer was yes. The <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">DenseNet</a>, composed of several densely-connected (in terms of residual connections) blocks, improved the performance on image classification tasks. An example of a densely-connected block is shown in Fig. 4. Like the ResNet, however, DenseNets were designed for classification and need to be modified for semantic segmentation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/denseblock.svg" alt="Example densely-connected block">
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Example densely-connected block</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326.pdf">Tiramisu</a> architecture blends together the DenseNet and the encoder-decoder with skip connections structure of the U-Net to get the benefits of the densely-connected convolutional layers, as well as the greater spatial-structure-preserving aspects of the U-Net.</p>

<p>The idea of how to blend the two architectures together is simple, but it works well for <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32248-938">medical image analysis applications</a>. The idea is simply to replace the convolutional blocks of the …</p></div></div></div>

				<p><em>I have built a custom search functionality for this blog,
based on Java and the Apache Lucene full-text search library,
compiled into a native binary using the Quarkus framework and GraalVM.
It is deployed as a Serverless application running on AWS Lambda,
providing search results without any significant cold start delay.
If you thought Java wouldn’t be the right language for this job, keep reading;
in this post I’m going to give an overview over the implementation of this feature and my learnings along the way.</em></p>
<p>Having a search functionality for my blog has been on my mind for quite some time;
I’d like to give users the opportunity to find specific contents on this blog right here on this site, without having to use an external search engine.
That’s not only nice in terms of user experience, but also having insight into the kind of information readers look for on this blog should help me to identify interesting things to write about in the future.</p>
<p>Now this blog is a static site — generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> — which makes this an interesting challenge.
I didn’t want to rely on an external search service
(see "Why No External Search Service" below for the reasoning),
and also a purely client-side solution as described in this <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/">excellent blog post</a> didn’t seem ideal.
While technically fascinating, I didn’t like the fact that it requires shipping the entire search index to the client for executing search queries.
Also things like result highlighting, customized result scoring, word stemming, fuzzy search and more seemed a bit more than I’d be willing to implement on the client.</p>
<p>All these issues have largely been solved on the server-side by libraries such as <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> for quite some time.
Using a library like Lucene means implementing a custom server-side process, though.
How to deploy such service?
Operating a VM 24/7 with my search backend for what’s likely going to be not more than a few dozen queries per month seemed a bit like overkill.</p>
<p>So after some consideration I decided to implement my own search functionality,
based on the highly popular Apache Lucene library,
deployed as a Serverless application,
which is started on-demand if a user runs a query on my website.
In the remainder of this post I’m going to describe the solution I came up with and how it works.</p>
<p>If you like, you can try it out right now, this post is about this little search input control at the top right of this page!</p>

<p>Why No External Search Service?</p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1284925378868518913">tweeting</a> about my serverless search experiment, one of the questions was "What’s wrong with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>?".
To be very clear, there’s nothing wrong with it at all.
External search services like Algolia, <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search">Google Custom Search</a>, or an Elasticsearch provider such as <a href="https://bonsai.io/">Bonsai</a> promise an easy-to-use, turn-key search functionality which can be a great choice for your specific use case.</p>
<p>However, I felt that none of these options would provide me the degree of control and customizability I was after.
I also ruled out any "free" options, as they’d either mean having ads or paying for the service with the data of myself or that of my readers.
And to be honest, I also just fancied the prospect of solving the problem by myself, instead of relying on an off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_why_serverless">Why Serverless?</h2>
<div>
<p>First of all, let’s discuss why I opted for a Serverless solution.
It boils down to three reasons:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Security:</em> While it’d only cost a few EUR per month to set up a VM with a cloud provider like Digital Ocean or Hetzner, having to manage a full operating system installation would require too much of my attention; I don’t want someone to mine bitcoins or doing other nasty things on a box I run, just because I failed to apply some security patch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cost:</em> Serverless does not only promise to scale-out (and let’s be honest, there likely won’t be millions of search queries on my blog every month), but also scale-to-zero.
As Serverless is pay-per-use and there are free tiers in place e.g. for AWS Lambda,
this service ideally should cost me just a few cents per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Learning Opportunity:</em> Last but not least, this also should be a nice occasion for me to dive into the world of Serverless, by means of designing, developing and running a solution for a real-world problem, exploring how Java as my preferred programming language can be used for this task</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_solution_overview">Solution Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>The overall idea is quite simple: there’s a simple HTTP service which takes a query string,
runs the query against a Lucene index with my blog’s contents and returns the search results to the caller.
This service gets invoked via JavaScript from my static blog pages,
where results are shown to the user.</p>
<p>The Lucene search index is read-only and gets rebuilt whenever I update the blog.
It’s baked into the search service deployment package,
which that way becomes fully immutable.
This reduces complexities and the attack surface at runtime.
Surely that’s not an approach that’s viable for more dynamic use cases,
but for a blog that’s updated every few weeks, it’s perfect.
Here’s a visualization of the overall flow:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.morling.dev/images/serverless_search_overview.png" alt="Serverless Search Solution Overview">
</p>
</div>
<p>The search service is deployed as a Serverless function on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>.
One important design goal for me is to avoid lock-in to any specific cloud provider:
the solution should be portable and also be usable with container-based Serverless approaches like <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a>.</p>
<p>Relying on a Serverless architecture means its start-up time must be a matter of milli-seconds rather than seconds,
so to not have a user wait for a noticeable amount of time in case of a cold start.
While <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/building-class-data-sharing-archives-with-apache-maven/">substantial improvements</a> have been made in recent Java versions to improve start-up times,
it’s still not ideal for this kind of use case.
Therefore, the application is compiled into a native binary via <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> and <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>,
which results in a start-up time of ~30 ms on my laptop, and ~180 ms when deployed to AWS Lambda.
With that we’re in a range where a cold start won’t impact the user experience in any significant way.</p>
<p>The Lambda function is exposed to callers via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a>,
which takes incoming HTTP requests, maps them to calls of the function and converts its response into an HTTP response which is sent back to the caller.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive down a bit more into the specific parts of the solution.
Overall, there are four steps involved:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_data_extraction">Data extraction:</a></em> The blog contents to be indexed must be extracted and converted into an easy-to-process data format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_search_backend_implementation">Search backend implementation:</a></em> A small HTTP service is needed which exposes the search functionality of Apache Lucene, which in particular requires some steps to enable Lucene being used in a native GraalVM binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_wiring_things_up">Integration with the website:</a></em> The search service must be integrated into the static site on GitHub Pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_deployment_to_aws_lambda">Deployment:</a></em> Finally, the search service needs to be deployed to AWS API Gateway and Lambda</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The first step was to obtain the contents of my blog in an easily processable format.
Instead of requiring something like a real search engine’s crawler,
I essentially only needed to have a single file in a structured format which then can be passed on to the Lucene indexer.</p>
<p>This task proved rather easy with Hugo;
by means of a <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/#output-formats-for-pages">custom output format</a> it’s straight-forward to produce a JSON file which contains the text of all my blog pages.
In my <em>config.toml</em> I declared the new output format and activate it for the homepage
(largely inspired by this <a href="https://xdeb.org/post/2017/06/11/make-hugo-generate-a-json-search-index-and-json-feed/">write-up</a>):</p>

<p>The template in <em>layouts/_default/list.searchindex.json</em> isn’t too complex either:</p>

<p>My stack of choice for this kind of application is Quarkus.
As a <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams-guide">contributor</a>, I am of course biased, but Quarkus is ideal for the task at hand:
built and optimized from the ground up for implementing fast-starting and memory-efficient cloud-native and Serverless applications,
it makes building HTTP services, e.g. based on JAX-RS, running on GraalVM a trivial effort.</p>
<p>Now typically a Java library such as Lucene will not run in a GraalVM native binary out-of-the-box.
Things like reflection or JNI usage require specific configuration,
while other Java features like method handles are only supported partly or not at all.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_apache_lucene_in_a_graalvm_native_binary">Apache Lucene in a GraalVM Native Binary</h3>
<p>Quarkus enables a wide range of popular Java libraries to be used with GraalVM,
but at this point there’s no extension yet which would take care of Lucene.
So I set out to implement a small Quarkus extension for Lucene.
Depending on the implementation details of the library in question, this can be a more or less complex and time-consuming endeavor.
The workflow is like so:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compile down an application using the library into a native image</p>

<li>
<p>run into some sort of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9565"><div><div><div><h2>While Apple wants MacBook users to remove Webcam tapes/covers, Purism’s Librem 14 Linux laptop now has microphone kill switch in addition to BIOS kill switch</h2><p>After Apple issued an <a href="https://androidrookies.com/taping-your-macbook-camera-to-prevent-it-from-spying-is-not-a-good-option-says-apple/">advisory to MacBook users</a> to not cover their webcams with tapes or physical switches, the need and efficacy of such methods is being <a href="https://androidrookies.com/purism-criticizes-apple-for-its-no-webcam-tape-covers-on-macbooks-advice/">debated</a> upon by tech gurus and pundits. The whole debate revolves around trusting Apple with users’ privacy and security. Many pro-Apple fanbois agree that users should let Apple decide what is best for them while the anti-camp says that kill switch is the way forward.</p><p>Apple may never offer a kill switch for the webcam on its MacBooks, but a Linux laptop maker, Purism is making kill switches its USP for selling its laptops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Purism is a Linux laptop maker that is huge on privacy and security. On 24th July Purism had announced that it will offer the Librem 14 PureOS power Linux laptops with BIOS kill switch which would give users <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-features-bios-and-ec-write-protection/">BIOS and EC flash chip write protection</a>.</p><p>Now the company CFO, <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-adds-microphone-kill-switch-enhancements/">Kyle Rankin has announced that Librem 14</a> will also feature a Microphone kill switch including even for those that are connected through the headphone jack. The Microphone kill switch will provide users physically disallow any spyware, hacker, or malware from using the microphone. If the Librem 14 user uses headsets with a built-in microphone, this kill switch disables the mic but leaves the audio to work properly so the user can continue to listen to any sound that comes through this port.</p><blockquote><p>With the Librem 14 we have enhanced this kill switch so that it also disables the microphone in the headphone jack while leaving audio out unaffected. That way if you happen to leave a headset plugged in–which is common in the age of quarantined video chats–you can use the hardware kill switch to disable all microphones, even ones connected through the headphone jack.</p><p>Kyle Rankin</p></blockquote><p>The Librem 14 is a 14 inch Linux PureOS powered laptop with Intel Core i7 10710U processor. The Librem 14 is priced at $1499 but the company is offering a flat $300 discount if you <a href="https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-14/">pre-order before August 7, 2020</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><small>Article - TypeScript - GraphQl<!-- --> · <!-- -->3 min read</small><h4>Autogenerate Typescript types and custom React hooks in React applications with GraphQL Code Generator.</h4><figure><img src="https://danilowoz.com/images/generating-typescript-types-and-react-hooks-based-on-graphql-endpoint/cover.jpg" alt="Generating TypeScript types and React Hooks based on GraphQL endpoint"><figcaption><small>Photo by Fred Jesus</small></figcaption></figure></header><p>Nowadays, developing ReactJS with TypeScript gives us a solid way to write applications: it adds the advantage of type-safety, component auto-documentation, error handling, and accurate autocomplete in the editor code. However, it still requires a considerable effort to write types and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seem redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind, <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">GraphQL Code Generator</a> gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:</strong> forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong> as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the dependencies needed:</p><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre></pre><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre></pre><p>I'm considering the following folder structure, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><pre><p><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>┗ package.json</span></p></pre></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project, named <code>codegen.yml</code>. The following snippet shows how I usually set it up in my projects, where it generates different files for its own purpose, in other words, split by concerns like GraphQL operations and server schemas:</p><pre><pre><p><span></span><span>schema</span><span>:</span><span> https</span><span>:</span><span>//countries</span><span>-</span><span>274616.ew.r.appspot.com/graphql/</span></p><p><span></span><span>overwrite</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>hooks</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>afterAllFileWrite</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>-</span><span> prettier </span><span>-</span><span>-</span><span>write</span></p><p><span></span><span>generates</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/schemas.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/operations.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>preset</span><span>:</span><span> import</span><span>-</span><span>types</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>presetConfig</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>typesPath</span><span>:</span><span> ./schemas</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span><span>-</span><span>operations</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/hooks.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>preset</span><span>:</span><span> import</span><span>-</span><span>types</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>presetConfig</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>typesPath</span><span>:</span><span> ./operations</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span><span>-</span><span>react</span><span>-</span><span>apollo</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>config</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withHOC</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withComponent</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withHooks</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span></p></pre></pre><p>Also, let's add the scripts to generate the schemas and watch the files change in <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><pre><p><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ...</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"schemas"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"schemas:watch"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"npm run schemas -- --watch"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></pre><p>And as it turns out in the editor code:</p><img src="https://danilowoz.com/images/generating-typescript-types-and-react-hooks-based-on-graphql-endpoint/live-coding.gif" alt="Live coding" width="800" height="461"><p>This is only one of the possible ways to use it, as it has many plugins, presets, integrations, and configurations, for different purposes such as to generate React higher-order component, Gatsby integration, prettier and lint the files, among other cool things.

<![CDATA[Standard C Loop Idioms]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>What’s your standard idioms for doing loops in C? A summary of a Twitter
thread betweeen me, Per Vognsen and Shachaf. 
<!-- excerpt end --></p>


<h2 id="looping-over-arrays">Looping over Arrays</h2>
<p>One of the most common idioms in a programming language is the form of a loop.
The idiomatic form is like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)  // or i += stride
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And for pointers:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (T *p = start; p != end; p++)  // or p += stride
    *p = 1.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not an arbitrary choice. It visits each member of an n-element array
indexed from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>. It places all loop control in the for itself, runs
in increasing order, and uses the very idiomatic ++ operator to update the loop
variable. It leaves the index variable at a known value just beyond the last
element.</p>

<p>But what about backwards iteration? How do you do that? Some use the <code>--&gt;</code> “operator”:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n; i--&gt;0;)
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Others prefers to start iterating at <code>n-1</code> (it was my preferred way in the past):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n-1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1252099900193435650">In a twitter thread, Per Vognsen
said</a> that he
prefers to start at n due to it being analoguous to the pointer case<sup id="fnref:indices-between"><a href="#fn:indices-between">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n; i &gt; 0; i--)
    a[i-1] = 1.0;

for (T *p = end; i != start; p++)
    p[-1] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>His motivation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>n-1</code> and <code>i &gt;= 0</code> form doesn’t translate to the pointer case without
invoking undefined behavior (you can’t point past the start of an object in
C). […] BTW, this is all related to the choice of using 0-based
indices/addresses and lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive ranges. With 1-based
indexing and lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive you have mirror symmetry.<sup id="fnref:EWD831"><a href="#fn:EWD831">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="using-unsigned-index-variables">Using Unsigned Index Variables</h2>
<p>In C the <code>sizeof</code> operator returns <code>size_t</code> and malloc takes a <code>size_t</code>
parameter. In C++ the containers <code>size()</code> method<sup id="fnref:size-rant"><a href="#fn:size-rant">3</a></sup> returns <code>size_t</code>
. Even more the <code>std::string</code> uses <code>size_t</code> in many parameters and it uses
<code>(size_t)-1</code> as a sentinel for value not found. So C and C++ programmers need
to deal with using unsigned index variables.</p>

<p>I like the idea of using <code>size_t</code> for showing intent: this variable represents
an index into memory. But it’s easy to end up with unintended underflow in the
for condition expression. Using <code>size_t</code> works fine for looping forward over a
collection <code>i = [0, n)</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But statements where the condition expression might be negative causes endless
loops, such as this when <code>offset</code> is larger than <code>n</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n-offset; i++) 
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So you have to guard each such for-statement inside an if-statement. Clumsy! I
haven’t found a way around that.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>size_t len = n - offset;
if (len &lt; n) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
        a[i] = 1.0;
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="iterators">Iterators</h2>
<p>I’ve, <a href="https://twitter.com/shachaf/status/1256772996154286082">like twitter user Shachaf</a> done C iterators in this style:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Iterator it = foo_start();
while (foo_next(&amp;it)) {
    ...it.value...
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1256775864366194690">Per pointed out</a> that this is a conflation of iterator state vs iterator value.
He places the return value of the next call inside the struct and ends up
with an API similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (Iterator it = iterator_init(); iterator_next(&amp;val);) 
    use(val);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Per has written a <a href="https://gist.github.com/pervognsen/fed0b1328b10b63f51ad42f961fc4058">line, word and token iterator using his Ion language in a
gist</a>. A
C implementation of a line iterator in his style would be:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>typedef struct StrLinesIter {
    const char *next;
    const char *start;
    const char *end;
} StrLinesIter;

StrLinesIter str_lines(const char *str) {
    return (StrLinesIter){ .next = str };
}

bool str_lines_next(StrLinesIter *iter) {
    if (!*iter-&gt;next) {
        return false;
    }
    iter-&gt;start = iter-&gt;next;
    iter-&gt;end = iter-&gt;next;
    while (*iter-&gt;end &amp;&amp; *iter-&gt;end != '\n') {
        iter-&gt;end++;
    }
    iter-&gt;next = *iter-&gt;end ? iter-&gt;end + 1 : iter-&gt;end;
    return true;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That iterator can be called like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (StrLinesIter iter = str_lines(buf); str_lines_next(&amp;iter);) {
        printf("...'%.*s'\n", (int)(iter.end - iter.start), iter.start);
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

But before we explain SLO, we need to go over another term:&nbsp;<strong>SLI</strong>&nbsp;(Service Level Indicator).</p><p>An SLI is a quantitative measurement of quality of a Service. It may be unique to each use-case, but there are certain standard qualities of services that practitioners tend to follow.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;The amount of time that a service was available to respond to a request.

For example, if the rate of food preparation at a restaurant falls below a certain number of dishes per hour, the customers are going to have longer waiting periods.</p><p>Having the right SLOs help you take better decisions.</p><h2 id="7501"><span id="Uptime"></span>Uptime<span></span></h2><p>One of the primary indicators and objectives is&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>. If the site isnâ€™t serving, speed and accuracy should not even be a concern. This is also why uptime is usually desired to be close to 100%.</p><p><em>If there’s a restaurant that sees footfall throughout the day and night, why shut and lose business.</em></p><p>How do we compute uptime? That’s fairly straightforward. The time that the systems were up / total time.</p><p>To compute:</p><p> \[x = {Up \over (Up + Down)}\%\]</p><hr><p>99% uptime means that out of&nbsp;<strong><em>total time</em>,</strong> we have&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>% allowance to not be available. Over the course of a year, this turns out to be 3.7 (~4) days.<br>But would a business, say a retail store be OK remaining shut for consecutive 4 days from 25th December â€” 28th December?</p><p>Uptime is like a periodic allowance that we get a refill on, not ration that we can keep accumulating. If it wasn’t spent, there’s no carry forward.</p><p>Based on each bucket, the downtime allowance may seem more palpable.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>9s</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Day</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Week</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Month</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Year</strong></td></tr><tr><td>99%</td><td>14.4 Mins</td><td>1.7 Hrs</td><td>7.3 Hrs</td><td>3.7 Days</td></tr><tr><td>99.9%</td><td>1.4 Mins</td><td>10.1 Mins</td><td>43.8 Hrs</td><td>8.7 Hrs</td></tr><tr><td>99.99%</td><td>8.6 Secs</td><td>1 Mins</td><td>4.4 Mins</td><td>52.6 Mins</td></tr><tr><td>99.999%</td><td>0.864 Secs</td><td>6.1 Secs</td><td>26.3 Secs</td><td>5.3 Mins</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Measure of Availability in 9s</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How do you measure the time that the service is up?</strong></p><p>A request comes in, the request was served.

For a request that wasnâ€™t served, there cannot be a log line emitted. So how do we measure it at the receiver? And how do we control the sender?</p><hr><h2 id="cd36"><span id="Option_1_SDK_(Measure_at_each_caller)"></span>Option 1: SDK (Measure at each caller)<span></span></h2><p>We could use an SDK that tracks every outbound request to our service. Depending on the design, one may be using&nbsp;<a href="https://envoy-mobile.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://envoy-mobile.github.io/</a>&nbsp;or a segment.com to emit constant metrics.

There will be a Firewall upstreaming to a Load Balancer upstreaming to a L7 proxy upstreaming to your servers.</p><blockquote><p>SLOs is an aggregate of all layers underneath.</p></blockquote><p>We should be talking about the SLO of each layer before the service as a whole. A breach in&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>&nbsp;SLO of a backend service would impact NOT the uptime but the&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio</strong>&nbsp;of the calling L7Proxy. Similarly, if the L7Proxy is down, Load Balancerâ€™s&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio</strong>&nbsp;will increase and not the&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>. All the way till we reach the CDN, probably.</p><p>So, Uptime (as customer experiences) is best measured at the layer which is closest to the Customer and farthest from the code.</p><p>Each such layer, we are probably monitoring the uptime of a component which is not our core business unit and outside our control. In the -&gt; LB -&gt; CDN -&gt; â€¦ journey, we have probably lost the uptime essence of the actual code deployed.</p><p><em>Itâ€™s possible that the business calls the SLO&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>, but what we’re actually addressing is the&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio!!</strong></em></p><hr><h2 id="a354"><span id="Option_2_Uptime_(actually_Downtime)_Monitors"></span>Option 2: Uptime (actually Downtime) Monitors<span></span></h2><p>This is where we introduce uptime monitors and downtime checkers. Simple services that have existed forever, but extremely crucial. Outsource the trust of uptime to these services where some poor bot(s) have been assigned the mundane work of periodically hitting a service endpoint.</p><p> \[Uptime = {timeUp \over (timeUp + timeDown)}\%\]</p><p>This introduces two compromises:</p><ul><li>Uptime is now as the monitor sees it,&nbsp;<strong>Not</strong>&nbsp;how the real customer sees it. Those 1% of ISP faults may still be affected.</li><li>How about the reliability of the uptime monitor? If we have trouble staying up 100% of the time, sure they cannot be up 100% of the time.</li></ul><p><em>Say, uptime monitor guarantees an uptime of 99.99%, What if those 4 minutes donâ€™t overlap? For the 4 minutes that the uptime monitor was down for, the service may be up or down, the monitor would not know.</em></p><hr><p>We donâ€™t keep all our eggs in the same basket. We introduce a multi-geography downtime monitor. Say a downtime monitor requests from 4 Geos.</p><ul><li>Should a failure across 1 Geo- be called a downtime?</li><li>What if one of the Geos is highlighting a downtime for a geographical region?</li><li>Also,&nbsp;<strong>CAP</strong>&nbsp;and Network failures.</li></ul><p>Downtime monitors arenâ€™t holier-than-thou. They go through glitches too. They need to retry too. Say if a request failed, wisdom says retry. Wisdom says Hystrix. But what about the failed attempt? Was it a failure or was it counted as success?</p><p>Before we proceed, there is a frequency too. How often do we check? We cannot go per second. We cannot go per minute. Itâ€™s a balance that we pick.</p><ul><li>The faster we check, the shallower will be the health check.</li><li>The slower we check, the deeper can be the health check.</li></ul><p>Depth of a health check is basically a trade-off we make. A shallow check only checks for a static response. A deeper health check will check for a DB operation in and out. The DB call obviously will take considerably longer and eat a transaction. We canâ€™t have that come in every 10 seconds.</p><p><em>The frequency vs depth is an argument that doesnâ€™t have one right answer. And like other things, we may just need both.</em></p><hr><h2 id="6263"><span id="Option_3_Statebased_Monitors"></span>Option 3: State-based Monitors<span></span></h2><p>Because the uptime is not being requested every ms, we count the time between states of the service.</p><p>We need states.&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</p><p>Error is confirmed down. The Unknown could be any emission that was interrupted or pending for retry or the duration that was in-between maintenance.</p><ul><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell for sure.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell whether service is Up or not.</li><li>Similarly, the time between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;is considered down, since it was down.</li></ul><p>This in itself is the first step of aggregation.</p><p>Letâ€™s take these two situations</p><ol><li>Counted as&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;for 20.

		</div><p>Some 700 years ago, the Tuscan town of Siena was a burgeoning banking and proto-industrial powerhouse with over 50,000 inhabitants — a population surpassed only by medieval “mega-cities” like Paris, London and Milan.</p>
<p>But then, in 1348, just when the thriving city was in the prime of its golden age, Siena’s prosperity was brought to a sudden halt by the Black Death. In just a few years, the city lost 60 percent of its population and entered into a steep decline, falling into obscurity. It took until the 20th century for it to <a href="http://www.montana.edu/historybug/yersiniaessays/davis.html#:~:text=In%201348%2C%20the%20pestilence%20struck,population%20(Benedictow%2C%202004).&amp;text=Siena%20suffered%20immensely%20more%20than,Florence%20both%20culturally%20and%20economically." target="_blank">recover</a> its pre-pandemic size.</p>
<p>COVID-19 isn’t nearly as deadly as the medieval bubonic plague, but the social and economic upheaval it’s caused is already leaving physical marks on modern cities in Europe: Once-busy business districts have emptied out as people opt to work from home. Shops and restaurants have closed. Public transport has slowed down.</p>
<p>There’s also reason to believe this pandemic could have an even more lasting impact than its predecessors. For the first time since the earliest cities emerged in the Fertile Crescent some 6,000 years ago, concentrated urban centers no longer have a monopoly on the economic and cultural connections that make civilizations tick forward.</p>

<p>For many workers worried about the coronavirus — and employers looking to cut costs during the economic crisis that has followed — technologies like video conferencing, shared documents and instant messaging provide viable alternatives to high-rise office buildings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, services like video streaming and social media and websites like Reddit and Twitter offer a taste of the cultural effervescence and community that has drawn so many to the big city over the centuries. You don't even need a bar or club to meet the love of your life: Apps like Tinder, Bumble or Grindr are happy to link you to a potential mate.</p>
<p>“This pandemic has the potential to really affect cities,” said Peter Clark, a professor of European urban history at the University of Helsinki.&nbsp;“If there isn’t a second wave, the changes may be far fewer than people are speculating. But if there is, we could see the European model of the ‘cultural city’ seriously affected.</p>
<p>“Because of deindustrialization, since the 1980s, we’ve had a shift to the service sector in order to maintain urban prosperity,” he added. “The pandemic poses a direct threat to that model.”</p>
<h3><strong>Ghost towns</strong></h3>
<p>There’s no question whether the pandemic has transformed working life.</p>
<p>In the early spring, as the coronavirus spread through Europe, government restrictions forced all but essential workers such as health and supermarket workers to work from home to keep new infections at bay. Industrial demand slowed or shut down completely as purchases of cars and other products collapsed.</p>
<p>Before the lockdowns, teleworking was not particularly common in most European countries.&nbsp;According to <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/data/percentage-of-workers-doing-telework-and-ict-based-mobile-work" target="_blank">data compiled by Eurofound</a>, just 11 percent of Germans and 8 percent of Italians “occasionally” worked remotely in 2015.</p>
<p>But as the crisis progressed, workers and businesses adjusted remarkably quickly to the new reality. Government, corporate and other meetings <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1310870">shifted online</a>; classes were taught <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1351286">virtually</a>; e-medicine and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1322367">virtual therapy</a> took off.</p>
<p>The question now is whether these new behaviors will stick — or whether most people will return to their offices as soon as they can.</p>

<p>Stanford University economist Nicholas Bloom, an expert on teleworking, says that while it’s unrealistic to expect everyone to work from home indefinitely, between 50 percent and 60 percent of the population would be able to keep at it.</p>
<p>“A third of the working population — office workers, senior management — can telework 100 percent of the time. Another third — clothing designers, real estate agents, scientific researchers — can do it most of the time, but will sometimes need to be onsite. And another third cannot do it at all: Most of these people are lower-paid service-sector workers, but you also have higher-range jobs like those held by dentists, surgeons, pilots.”</p>
<p>Bloom says it’s still too early to tell how intense the impact of the pandemic will be, but that it’s unlikely that office workers will want to go back to business as usual, even if a cure or a vaccine is developed.</p>
<p>“The skyscrapers and office buildings in the city centers that used to be our most valued real estate have become places people avoid out of fear of infection,” Bloom said. “I don’t see people growing comfortable with packed subway trains and elevators, and firms aren't going to want to open and close every time there’s a wave.”</p>

<p>“It’s the fear of the virus that keeps people at home,” said Sven Smit, senior partner at McKinsey &amp; Company and co-chair of the McKinsey Global Institute. He added that while it was too early to be certain the shift would stick, “the tendency [for longer-term change] is there.”</p>
<p>Companies have already taken notice of the opportunities for cost-cutting. A <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/covid-19-impacts-on-commercial-property-202006.html" target="_blank">new&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;from Credit Suisse indicates that office space rental income loss has “so far been limited.” At the same time, however, “executive boards — including those of large global corporations — have identified the latent potential to make savings and are already looking to reduce the amount of space they use.”</p>
<p>Commercial property investments fell by an average of 44 percent across Europe between the middle of March and the end of May, according to <a href="https://www.realestate.bnpparibas.com/covid-19-report-june-2020" target="_blank">figures</a>&nbsp;released by BNP Paribas Real Estate last month; the decline was especially notable in Ireland, where the Irish Times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/irish-commercial-property-deals-slump-most-in-eu-amid-covid-19-1.4286605" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that commercial property deals slumped by 79 percent during that period.</p>

<p>In a sign the trend is likely to continue, tech companies like<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home" target="_blank"> Twitter</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/working-google/working-from-home-and-office/" target="_blank">Google</a> have announced plans for their employees to continue working remotely, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/most-german-companies-say-work-from-home-should-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank">new&nbsp;survey</a> conducted by Germany’s Ifo Institute shows that 54 percent of businesses want to make greater use of home offices henceforth.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10111936118050541/" target="_blank">has said</a> he expects half the company’s workforce to be working from home in the next decade — and that employees who moved to less expensive areas would see their salaries cut to reflect the cost of living.</p>
<p>Michel Serafinelli, an economics lecturer at the University of Essex, said that the value of office space could be expected to decline. “Why rent a big office that only a few workers will be able to use at a time, and only on certain days each week?”</p>
<h3><strong>COVID-flight</strong></h3>
<p>The end of the office, should it come to pass, would transform the urban landscape. Workers, unshackled from their morning commute, will be free to gravitate to suburbs and the countryside.</p>
<p>Europe has a long tradition of rich city-dwellers fleeing plagues to the countryside, leaving the poor and working class behind. In Giovanni Boccaccio’s 14th-century literary landmark, "The Decameron," wealthy Florentines escaped to the Tuscan countryside to hide from the Black Death.</p>
<p>During the coronavirus crisis, urban elites in hard-hit places like Spain and France left the city for greener and safer pastures. Former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/europe/rich-coronavirus-second-homes.html" target="_blank">traveled to his holiday villa in Marbella</a> rather than ride out the lockdown in Madrid.</p>
<p>If there are further waves of the coronavirus or home-working continues to proliferate, that trend could easily stick. Why pay big-city rents for an undersized apartment if you can pursue an equally attractive career from a house in the hills? And from the employer’s point of view, why pay big-city salaries if you can source the same talent for cheaper, even if you never or rarely see your employees in person.</p>
<p>But even if teleworking does become ubiquitous, not everybody will be able — or will want — to flee to the suburbs and the country. And those who stay behind may find the city they call home has become a very different place.</p>

<p>“Cities are almost certainly going to become cheaper, because more spaces become available,” Bloom said. “That might help address the affordability crisis we see in urban centers ... but that’s going to leave quite a vacuum.” Artists, he added, “might move into the vacant spaces, but they don’t spend much money, and that’s quite a problem for cities that rely on revenue to offer services.”</p>
<p>Businesses are already suffering from the knock-on effects of emptier business areas and city centers. Shops, restaurants and other services that depend on corporate and other clientele are reeling from the pandemic’s economic impact.</p>
<p>“The restaurants where executives go out to lunch, the cafés where secretaries grab their cappuccino, the retail shops where workers shop on their breaks…&nbsp;If the offices go, we&nbsp;can plausibly expect urban expenditure to drop by a third,” Bloom said. “That’s a hit which most commercial spaces can’t take.”</p>
<p>In Brussels’ European Quarter, the disappearance of the Eurocrats and office workers who used to flood Rue de la Loi and the Schuman Roundabout already led to <a href="https://twitter.com/liliebayer/status/1278689951723462658" target="_blank">the&nbsp;closure</a> of one of the area’s most popular cafés.

Let’s work through the steps below:</p><h2 id="1dfd">Step 1: Upload Style Transfer Notebook</h2><p id="93e0">Simply open Google Colab, and in the intro flow where you’re prompted to choose a project/Notebook, drag-and-drop the provided Python Notebook file. Once you’ve done that, Colab should automatically connect to the appropriate runtime—so for the purposes of this project, you won’t need to adjust anything there.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3838/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png" width="1919" height="882" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Drag-and-drop the provided model file here.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="12c9">Step 2: Upload Style and Reference (Test) Images</h2><p id="c9aa">Because we’re training our own custom style transfer model, we’ll need to supply our model with the necessary training inputs: a <em>style image</em> and a <em>content reference </em>image.</p><p id="5f3e">With other templates (i.e. Classification, Segmentation), you’d need to upload full image datasets, but here, given the model architecture and task, you’ll only need to upload two images. These are the ones I chose:</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1144/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png 572w" sizes="572px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3072/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png" width="1536" height="1536" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/858/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png 429w" sizes="429px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: Style Image; Right: Content Reference Image</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="4bf6">To upload these, simply drag-and-drop them into the “Files” tab on the left-side panel. Click “Ok” when notified that exiting the runtime will delete these files — we should have a fully trained model once we’re done with this process, so no need to worry about that.</p><blockquote><p id="f5d5"><strong>Important note: </strong>To ensure the model accepts these two input images, they must be named <code>style_image</code> and <code>test_image</code>, respectively. They should be in <code>.png</code> format.</p></blockquote><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif" width="600" height="330" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><h2 id="6ffa">Step 3: Train the Model</h2><p id="7bcc">Because all the model needs is a single style image to train on and a reference image to test on, we’re ready to train our model once we’ve uploaded these two images.</p><p id="4852">If you scroll through the Notebook you’ll notice each step in the process is commented out, with explanations for what’s happening at each step. I like this kind of additional detail, as it gives small windows into how the model is trained at each step, along with the requisite code blocks. So if you’re interested, I’d encourage you to sift through it to get a flavor of Snap’s magic sauce.</p><p id="9a0b">But if you just want to train your model, click <strong>Runtime </strong>in the top nav bar and choose the first option, <strong>Run All. </strong>This will automatically run all code blocks in succession, all the way from installing the necessary libraries to importing training data (the model leverages the COCO dataset to help train) to training, converting, and downloading the model.</p><blockquote><p id="b900">Note: I was hit with a notification during COCO training data extraction (code block 13 in this template) that indicated I was running out of disk space. If you see this alert, just click OK—with this model training job, using the default runtime, you won’t eclipse that disk space limit.</p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1036/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png" width="518" height="543" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/970/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png 485w" sizes="485px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1146/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png" width="573" height="564" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1032/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png 516w" sizes="516px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Visualizing model training (left: epochs 0–250; right: epochs 5000–5250)</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="5402">As you can see in the screenshots above, the Notebook provides a nice in-progress training visualization, which gives you both a qualitative and quantitative look at how the model is coming along.</p><p id="916e">After 10,000 training loops (the default amount — seemed like somewhere between 5000–7500 would have been sufficient), the model successfully trained! Next, we need to download the model and start working with it in Lens Studio.</p><h2 id="f821">Step 4: Downloading the .ONNX file</h2><p id="41bd">This might have to do with my inexperience in coding and working with Colab, but this part tripped me up just a bit. Since all the other code blocks had run automatically, I assumed the same for the model download.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1174/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png" width="587" height="198" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1174/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 587w" sizes="587px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="a979">But as you can see in the above screenshot, there’s a note at the end that we need to “uncomment” and run the code block manually to actually download the file. Delete the <code>#</code> from the <code>download_onnx_from_colab()</code> function, and delete the remaining white space so that the function is all the way to left margin of the code block.</p><p id="9cdb">Run the block again, and your <code>.onnx</code> file should automatically download. Now we’re ready to implement our custom style transfer model in Lens Studio!</p><p id="cb3d">If you’ll recall, Lens Studio includes a range of templates that pre-populate projects with certain components, textures, and more. One of those is Snap’s Style Transfer Template, and it should be easily accessible from the Lens Studio home page.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3832/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png" width="1916" height="986" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Empty Style Transfer Template</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="0531">Above is what you’ll see when you launch the Style Transfer template. The Lens Studio team has already configured this template with components needed to import and run style transfer models built with their Notebooks.</p><p id="2634">Also, you can see that there’s already a preview in the right panel—this is the pre-built model, fashioned from the style and test images Snap provides in the original zip file. Our task here is to add our own model and tell Lens Studio to use it in order to apply the target style within the Lens.</p><h2 id="602b">Step 1: Import Model File</h2><p id="11f6">First, we need to import the <code>.onnx</code> model file into the <strong>Resources</strong> panel (lower left).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section></section><section><article><p>Apps and websites are baked into the e-commerce business plan of practically every startup. As startups move past the early funding rounds, the VCs funding and advising them have to ask, “What’s slowing online growth and how can we help?”</p><p>A usual suspect in these e-commerce growing pains is staffing. Ramping up a solid internal team takes a while, especially when management roles and product plans surf the taller waves of Series A. Startups find themselves confronting a common trade-off between spending on product and spending on marketing and user acquisition.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding a nimble partner at the beginning can help control costs and ensure that you're establishing a strong product foundation until a company’s internal team takes shape. Experienced developers, UX designers, user acquisition experts, and project managers can provide much-needed stability and deliver product updates on time.</p><h4>Find an Agency That’s Flexible</h4><p>Startups vary greatly in the expertise they bring to the table. Some founders are engineers, some favor product management or design, others focus on market research and marketing, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>An effective product partner will be experienced and flexible enough to immediately plug into your most urgent needs, whether it’s front-end development or user acquisition or content strategy.</p><p>That flexibility extends to cost too, sometimes you just need a few people, other times you need an entire team to design, develop, and test a site and app. If an agency can’t go lean or be nimble, move on.</p><p>More importantly, determine if an outside agency can fit in with an existing product team, understand the product vision, and provide firm guidance and structure without stepping on toes.</p><h4>Beware False Prophets</h4><p>When you’re hiring an agency, cost looms over everything. We get it, it’s unavoidable. Startups can feel abstract in the early days, so you don’t want everybody thinking you’re burning cash on something that’s still taking shape.</p><p>But beware of outliers that promise the moon and come in with a low estimate. The long-term cost of using a crummy company the first time around is exorbitant and can be a real company-killer. When bad UX and development get in the bloodstream that early, correcting problems later is a challenge. Broken products, broken dreams!</p><p>VCs should look at an agency’s longevity and relationships:</p><ul><li>How long has the agency been around</li><li>Do they form long-term partnerships with their clients</li><li>Do they get to iterate on projects and therefore really understand users and their needs</li><li>Does the agency portfolio have a healthy mix of large and small companies</li></ul><p>You want to assess an agency's UX process. How do they get to know users and how do they translate UX insights into better experiences? What’s their idea of a frictionless customer experience? And, can they provide reviews and references, just like an individual who’s applying for a job?</p><h4>Be Realistic About “Turnkey” Solutions</h4><p>Please carry grains of salt when considering e-commerce solutions that position themselves as easy and out-of-the-box. Even if your startup is already doing $2-3 million in online sales, chances are you’re going to need a team to help you overcome hurdles you didn’t expect.</p><p>There is a tremendous number of third-party applications for Shopify that handle things like wish lists or reviews or shipping calculations. Some we euphemistically describe as “budget quality,” offering limited customer support, wobbly functionality, and infrequent updates.&nbsp;</p><p>When these apps are updated they can wreak havoc on the rest of your ecosystem. They need to be vetted, monitored, and often tweaked beyond the original code to fit your customer UX and product fulfillment needs.</p><p>Updates can come fast and furious from the solutions providers too. Shopify, Netsuite, and AWS roll out updates big and small all the time (and occasionally unannounced). The potential for things to break, especially if you're making changes to a live site, can be alarmingly high.</p><h4>Since We’re On The Subject of Updates…</h4><p>Get used to them. For some reason, there's still a perception that digital updates and upgrades are a one-time cost, and that once an update happens a product &nbsp;is finally “done.” But that's really never the case. No software is that way anymore, really.</p><p>Consumer products from Adobe and Microsoft have charged monthly subscriptions for their products for years, and they roll out updates regularly. Ditto for many photo and video editing apps on your phone.</p><p>Once you move into the e-commerce space, that principle multiplies. Shopify isn't a flat fee for a reason. Baking in a regular “maintenance” cost is mandatory, and you’ll save yourself headaches by planning for it quarterly versus ad hoc.</p><p>Managing updates applies to product offerings too. E-commerce plans need new products to stay interesting to customers, which in turn requires digital expertise. Are there wholly-new offerings? Are existing product names/lines changing, and are new sizes and colors available? Are new filtering capabilities required since there are more products?</p><h4>Don’t Sleep On Mobile</h4><p>There’s a library of articles dispelling the myth that people don’t buy things on their phones. Some estimates put mobile driving <a as="a" href="https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/blogs/immersive-commerce-leads-retails-jump-to-light-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36% of online sales and 58% of all retail traffic.</a></p><p>And yet, that myth persists, maybe because the UX of mobile retail changes so quickly. Or, it could be that the process of getting the web experience right is so time-consuming and cost-intensive, mobile simply becomes an afterthought.</p><p>Lockdown has <a as="a" href="https://internetretailing.net/mobile-theme/mobile-theme/mobile-and-social--along-with-international-traffic--driving-uk-ecommerce-growth--21709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally changed that perception</a>, and like clockwork, the percentage of mobile purchasing is ticking up every month <a as="a" href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/millennials-and-gen-zers-look-to-retailers-for-a-more-community-minded-comm/581604/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(especially among younger shoppers embracing “decentralized commerce”)</a>.</p><p>We’ve also observed changing mobile patterns among customers in loyalty programs. The sharp rise of contactless payments (overall use in the U.S. has <a as="a" href="https://tearsheet.co/payments/as-the-effects-of-covid-19-continue-to-rise-in-the-u-s-so-does-the-use-of-contactless-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased by 150%</a> since March 2019) will boost mobile purchasing across retail sectors too, in-store and at home. It just can’t be an afterthought anymore.</p><h4>Think About Customization</h4><p>Even if a business doesn’t have many SKUs at the moment, room to grow is essential. Customers (especially in sectors like wellness, jewelry, or fashion) want variants, and a lot of them: different colors, sizes, accessories, and add-ons.&nbsp;</p><p>Some e-commerce platforms offer a&nbsp;very&nbsp;limited number of product variants. If a startup has highly-customizable merch, find out how many options your solutions provider can offer … and how smooth the UX ride will be for customers.</p><p>Even if customization isn’t an essential part of your product plan, you should think about (at least) one or two highly-specific technical “must-haves” the online shopping experience will need as it evolves.</p><p>For instance, how will a product fulfillment team’s workflow integrate with a new e-commerce setup? Can a new site handle your post-purchase automation strategy? If your solutions start looking makeshift and jury-rigged, it’s probably because they are. Don’t run from simple solutions to complex backend problems.</p><hr></article></section><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><main><article><section><div><p><span>Mon Jul 27 2020</span></p><div><div><p>A friend and I were discussing school openings in light of Covid19. He was keen on keeping the kids home, while I though it would be better if our kids could go to school and interact in person. To convince me that school should remain online, he sent me an article with the following title - "Scans Reveal Heart Damage in Over Half of COVID-19 Patients!" </p>
<p>Wow, that sounds scary, no parent would want their kids to get heart damage from going to school! If Covid was indeed causing all these issues, then of course it would be wise to keep kids at home. But was it? </p>
<p>From what I could tell after reading the actual paper cited in the article (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa178/33402488/jeaa178.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow">link here</a>), the paper was not very scientific and had no clear evidence that heart issues in the study were somehow the result of Covid. They sampled a handful of old people who had Covid, and found issues with their cardiograms. They used the two unrelated measurements to draw a conclusion that Covid was somehow responsible for the potential heart problems. To be sure that I was not hallucinating, I asked a medical statistician friend for his opinion. His answer? </p>
<p>"This study reveals no clinically useful information. This is an online retrospective survey, which is generally the lowest possible grade of robustness of clinical data. Definitely not good enough to suggest any causality. Absolutely empty paper."</p>
<p>This is the new reality we live in. Information is free, it's abundant, anyone can publish without much thought, and it is being disseminated with incredible speed. Pick a catchy headline, make the most noise, and your opinion becomes the truth, regardless of how wrong it actually is.</p>
<p>Not only is this bad because false information gets across as facts, it also confuses people and makes us question the facts. No information is safe, no truth is for certain.</p>
<p>The problem with this paper on heart conditions, for example, is that it is not explicitly false. Even though the headline, the data, and the conclusion are all misleading, the very idea that Covid could be related to heart conditions introduces a doubt. The paper does not prove that Covid causes heart conditions, but it also does not prove that it does not. </p>
<p>A trained scientific mind will see that to prove that Covid does not cause heart problems you would have to design a study in which a group of volunteers would get infected with Covid at random, and then measured to see if they develop any such problems. You would not find many volunteers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people without training would read this paper and interpret the lack of evidence as the evidence in itself. "See, they did not prove that Covid did not cause heart problems, therefore there is a <em>chance</em> that it may have caused heart problems." - they would say.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to get their kids sick, so it's only natural to look for ways to be at least somewhat right, when being right means your kids will be safe. But when it comes to serious issues, being right for the sake of being right is wrong. </p>
<p>If we continue down this path, where instead of having intellectual conversations we instead try to win arguments at all costs, we are going to fail. We will have true information presented as disinformation and visa-versa, and so long as it seems legitimate and appeals to one's believes, it would be interpreted as true information.</p>
<p>There is no quick solution to this problem. Facebook won't fix it for us. While Facebook, through human scanning and algorithms can identify that a shark walking across the desert is probably a piece of fake news, only inquisitive dissection of data can uncover fake news like the one above. No, the solution to this problem is us, the collective wisdom of humans.</p>
<p>To be able to identify this type of high quality fake, we need to debate, to discuss, to be willing to lose and to be willing to be wrong. We need to have the freedom to doubt, and the desire to uncover the truth, regardless of what we find. We need to share, openly, willingly, without being afraid that such thoughts would get us in trouble. Asking questions, reasoning, those are the basics we should hold dear.</p>
<p>It is on me, and on on you, and on all of us to be curious, to question the status quo, to question the authority, to question the media and the truth as it appears. But question it not blindly, at the expense of all reason, but question it with the naiveté and the intellectual curiosity of a child. </p>
<p>Assume you don't know, look for answers, don't stop until there are no more questions.</p>

<br/>
July 29, 2020 | https://insideclojure.org/2020/07/28/clj-exec/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://insideclojure.org/2020/07/28/clj-exec/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A new development version of clj is now available (1.10.1.600) and it includes the first public release of several strands of work that have been ongoing over the last few months (with more to come).</p>

<p>This version has not yet been promoted to “stable” release. You can either install it explicitly with that version though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Linux, use the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_installation_on_linux">instructions here</a> but with 1.10.1.600.</li>
  <li>On Mac, use a <a href="https://github.com/clojure/homebrew-tools#version-archive-tool-releases">versioned release</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>brew uninstall clojure</li>
      <li>brew install clojure/tools/clojure@1.10.1.600</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On Windows, use the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows#install">install</a> but with 1.10.1.600.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>

<p>The primary feature of this release is support for a new kind of Clojure calling convention. Since the beginning, <code>clj</code> has been wrapping <code>clojure.main</code> for execution. <code>clojure.main</code> has its roots deep in the early years of Clojure and supports invoking the <code>-main</code> function of a Clojure namespace or running a Clojure script (reading and evaluating it).</p>

<p>We stepped back to think about how the command line for a Clojure entry point should look and came to several conclusions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Execution should be tied to a fully-qualified function</li>
  <li>The function’s namespace should be automatically loaded (thanks <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/requiring-resolve">requiring-resolve</a>!)</li>
  <li>Arguments should be key/value, not positional</li>
  <li>We want to work in edn, not strings</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus you can now define programs as functions that take a map and execute them via clj:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clojure <span>[</span>clj-opt<span>*</span><span>]</span> <span>-X</span>:an-alias <span>[</span>kpath v]<span>*</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>-X is configured with a descriptor map with <code>:fn</code> and <code>:args</code> keys and stored under an alias in deps.edn:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:aliases</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>:my-fn</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:fn</span><span> </span><span>my.qualified/fn</span><span>
   </span><span>:args</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:my</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:data</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>}</span><span>
          </span><span>:config</span><span> </span><span>456</span><span>}}}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For more on using aliases to name edn data, see the “Alias data” section below.</p>

<p>To invoke, pass the name of the alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can supply additional keys, or override values stored in the deps.edn file by passing pairs of key-path and value. The key-path should either be a single key or a vector of keys to refer to a nested key (as with assoc-in). Each key-path will be used to assoc-in to the original <code>:args</code> map, overriding the value there.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># Top key override</span>
clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn :config 789

<span># Nested key override</span>
clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn <span>'[:my :data]'</span> 789</code></pre></figure>

<p>Key/value pairs are read as edn strings. A general rule is that you can surround edn data with single quotes (like <code>'data'</code>) to get a literal shell string (which exec will read as edn data). In some cases (particularly numbers and keywords), you can omit the single quotes as bash does not have any conflicting interpretation. Note that strings must be passed in double quotes, also surrounded by single quotes to escape correctly with bash: <code>clj -X:my-fn :config '"foo"'</code>.</p>

<h2 id="local-maven-install">Local Maven install</h2>

<p>One helper program included in this release is clojure.tools.deps.alpha.tools.install/install. You can execute this program with -X to install a jar into your local Maven cache.</p>

<p>The install argmap takes the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>:jar (required) - path to jar file</li>
  <li>:pom (optional) - path to pom file</li>
  <li>:lib (optional) - qualified symbol like my.org/lib</li>
  <li>:version (optional) - string</li>
  <li>:classifier (optional) - string</li>
  <li>:local-repo (optional) - path to local repo (default = ~/.m2/repository)</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the tool configuration to your deps.edn under an alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:aliases</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>:install</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:fn</span><span> </span><span>clojure.tools.deps.alpha.tools.install/install</span><span>
  </span><span>;; :args map could be provided but can pass on command line instead</span><span>
  </span><span>}}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To execute, use the built-in <code>:deps</code> alias to include tools.deps.alpha on the classpath, execute the install tool with -X and pass the args on the command line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clj <span>-A</span>:deps <span>-X</span>:install :jar <span>'"/path/to.jar"'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(As mentioned above, edn strings must be in double quotes, and then single-quoted for the shell.)</p>

<p>The install tool will find the pom inside the jar file (if it exists) and use that to determine the groupId, artifactId, and version coordinates to use when the jar is installed. Alternately, you can provide a pom file or specific coordinates via the other attributes.</p>

<p>Other existing “programs” provided with <code>clj</code> (like <code>-Sresolve-tags</code>) may be converted to this in the future.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-basis">Runtime basis</h2>

<p>The primary functionality provided by tools.deps is to take a set of dependencies and compute the expansion of the transitive dependency tree and the subsequent classpath intended for a set of deps and paths. While we had means to give you parts of that result, it has been clear from working on other features and libraries (add-lib, tools.deps.graph, etc) that we needed something to tie all of this information together.</p>

<p>We call the output of the resolution process the “runtime basis” (or just “basis” for short). The runtime basis is a map that is a combination of the inputs to the process (merged deps, resolve-args, classpath-args) and the outputs (the lib-map and classpath-map). In combination this data can be used to understand the full classpath context of a subsequent execution.</p>

<p>The Clojure tools now caches the computed basis data, just as it previously cached the lib map data, and injects the basis file into the execution via the Java system property “clojure.basis”. Programs can read this data using the tools already in Clojure (it’s just an edn map):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>require</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>clojure.java.io</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>jio</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>clojure.edn</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>edn</span><span>])</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>basis</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getProperty</span><span> </span><span>"clojure.basis"</span><span>)</span><span> 
               </span><span>jio/file</span><span>
               </span><span>slurp</span><span>
               </span><span>edn/read-string</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="alias-data">Alias data</h2>

<p>deps.edn aliases were always conceived of as an open mechanism to store edn data and give it a name for use in programs. For a long time we have only used it to provide such data to the internal processes of <code>clj</code> itself (via <code>-A</code> etc), but with this release we are expanding the use of alias data in several ways.</p>

<p>First, :paths can now (in addition to path strings), take alias names that refer to vectors of paths:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>:clj-paths</span><span> </span><span>:resource-paths</span><span>]</span><span>

<p>Second, execution with <code>clj -X:an-alias</code> takes an alias that provides a map of inputs for a function.</p>

<p>Third, the runtime basis is injected into a program so anyone can write programs that take the alias for edn data stored in deps.edn and make use of it via the basis:</p>

<h2 id="deprecated-unqualified-lib-names">Deprecated unqualified lib names</h2>

<p>One other change that you may notice in this release is that we have deprecated support for unqualified lib names in <code>:deps</code>. Unqualified lib names (like <code>cheshire</code> or <code>hiccup</code>) are interpreted in Maven terms as having the same groupId and artifactId. Unqualified lib names will now warn on use - you can address by using the qualified name (<code>cheshire/cheshire</code> or <code>hiccup/hiccup</code>).</p>

<p>The groupId exists to disambiguate library names so our ecosystem is not just a race to grab unqualified names. The <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html">naming convention in Maven</a> for groupId is to follow Java’s package naming rules and start with a reversed domain name or a trademark, something you control. Maven itself does not enforce this but the Maven Central repository does all new projects.</p>

<p>In cases where you have a lib with no domain name or trademark, you can use a third party source of identity (like github) in combination with an id you control on that site, so your lib id would be <code>github-yourname/yourlib</code>. Using a dashed name is preferred over a dotted name as that could imply a library owned by github.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day, we carry burdens of family, job, and community. We manage the load by breaking them into pieces and put them into a to-do list. The agony of life is that the more tasks we tick off the list, the more added. Running faster seems to be the only way out, so we run faster aided by tools, only to discover at the end of a period that we have been running on a treadmill with ever-increasing speed, going nowhere.</p><p>I have run on the treadmill of tasks with panting of disappointment for more weeks than I can count. For reasons I can't explain, enlightenment in life strikes only at the trough of despair. I was reminded of a story in the great Indian epic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, during one of the downcast days. The story goes like this.</p><p><em>I'm paraphrasing the story here, so if you know the story, allow me some latitude.</em></p><blockquote><p>One day, Drona, the teacher, lines up his students to teach archery. He commands them to focus on a bird on a near-by tree. Every student raised their bow and was ready to shoot. <br>
Before they shoot, he walks over to each student and asks them what they see. <br>
“I see the tree, the branch, and the bird” answers the first student. Drona asks him to put the bow down and stand aside. He moves to the next student. <br>
“Tree, branch, and the bird …” The second student repeats the same answer. And the next, and the next. Finally, Drona approaches Arjuna. “What do you see, my favorite boy?” <br>
“The tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird,” Arjuna replied. <br>
“Do you see the tree and the leaves?” Asked Drona. <br>
“No, just the tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird.” <br>
“Shoot,” commands Drona. <br>
Arjuna releases the arrow and hits the target.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Moral of the story: When you want to achieve something, your attention should be on what you have and what you target. Everything else is noise, and you should shut them out.</p></blockquote><p>I'm no archer, but I can transfer the fundamentals to any domain of interest. I started building a system that embodies the principles of the above story. I have used and fine-tuned the system for long, so I feel sure to share it with you. Here are the fundamental principles behind this system:</p><ul><li>Know the outcomes that you want to achieve</li><li>See the outcomes often</li><li>Create projects to reach the outcomes</li><li>Divide each project into weekly wins</li><li>Win a day</li><li>Review to learn, pat, and adjust</li><li>Iterate this cycle to win the outcomes</li></ul><h2 id="know-the-outcomes">Know the outcomes</h2><blockquote><p>It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower - Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The top idea in your mind</a></p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/wins-plan.png" alt=""></p><p>We don't stop thinking about our personal life when we enter the office, and we don't stop thinking of our job when we play with our kids. Thus it is futile to try for a balance; rather, we should integrate all areas of our lives to have a fulfilling life.</p><p>After many iterations, I have found <strong>four areas that encompass all of life</strong>, and if I do well in those areas, I would have a fulfilling life. They are <strong>w</strong>ealth, <strong>i</strong>nsights, <strong>n</strong>etwork, and <strong>s</strong>elf-control.</p><p>For each area, I think of one or two outcomes I want to achieve in three years. The outcomes I want to accomplish in each area in the coming three years looks like this:</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong></p><ul><li>Launch Gravitas WINS course</li></ul><p><strong>Insights</strong></p><ul><li>Learn to run a digital business (Gravitas WINS course)</li></ul><p><strong>Network</strong></p><ul><li>Five mentors &amp; Five Thousand Students</li></ul><p><strong>Self-control</strong></p><ul><li>Stay fit and healthy</li></ul><p>All the projects are related, hence it is easier to remember and think about them cohesively. Because they are cohesive, ideas pop into my head during showers or when I take a walk.</p><p>Once I know the outcomes, I divide them further into quarterly projects and weekly milestones. At any quarter, I run only one or two projects. In this quarter, JAS 2020, I am focusing only on two projects:</p><ul><li>Completing the material for the Gravitas WINS course</li><li>Double the subscribers for this newsletter</li></ul><h2 id="win-the-day">Win the day</h2><blockquote><p>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - Navy SEALs</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/daily-wins.png" alt=""></p><p>WINS sheet is not a glorified to-do list; it is not even a to-do list by another name. It is a WINS sheet. I enter only those activities that will move me towards the outcome.</p><p>There are always other tasks that I need to do. I do one of the three with those tasks:</p><ul><li>avoid them</li><li>delegate them</li><li>do a good enough job to move on</li></ul><h2 id="reflect-daily--review-weekly">Reflect daily &amp; Review weekly</h2><p>Every day, I reflect on the day that went by.</p><ul><li>Did something catch my attention?</li><li>Did I do something beyond expectation?</li><li>Was I distracted?</li><li>Did I spend too much on movies or YouTube?</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/weekly-reflection.png" alt=""></p><p>Every Sunday night, I sit with the sheet and review the previous week.</p><p>There is always a surprise every week. New things pop up; I completed more than I planned; but most weeks, I completed only 80% of what I intended.</p><p>Since the outcome is clear, I am not disappointed even if I have not completed everything I planned. Eighty percent progress every week towards the outcome is a great move forward.</p><p>When I review every week, I get 54 chances to review and amend my ways.</p><h2 id="adjust-as-you-go-along">Adjust as you go along</h2><p>After the Sunday review, I take a print-out for the next week. I write down the three-year outcome and the quarterly projects again. Repeatedly writing the expected results gives me a moment to consider the outcomes and projects in light of what I know.</p><ul><li>Do these outcomes still make sense?</li><li>Are these projects the best way to achieve the outcomes?</li><li>Is there a way to achieve the outcome differently?</li><li>Can I partner with someone to reach the milestone in half the time?</li><li>Can I use any tool to amplify my efforts?</li></ul><p>I go through these questions, and I adjust the outcomes, projects, and weekly wins. Usually, I don't make any changes to outcomes and projects. But there are always changes to weekly wins.</p><h2 id="drown-out-the-noise">Drown out the noise</h2><p>Going through such routine cement the outcomes in my mind. My unconscious mind reflects these outcomes all the time - when I sleep, work out, or take a shower. My mind doesn't think of anything else.

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksvlJ3F4Mcc" width="320" youtube-src-id="ksvlJ3F4Mcc"></iframe></p><p>I have a confession: I used to be a Mac gamer. For a long period of time, my main gaming machine was a Mac. My daily driver not too long ago was a hand-me-down 2007 MacBook Pro with 4gb ram and 128mb vram. I managed to still game on the thing, even as it burnt my lap (thanks Apple!) and pushed the machine to its absolute limits. Some of the games I played included <i>Borderlands</i> and <i>Borderlands 2</i>, <i>Skyrim</i> and <i>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</i>. Some games were an absolute joy to play, others were a semi-pixellated mess with textures popping in.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not very fun at times but this was all I had at the time.&nbsp;</p><h3>Beginnings</h3><p>I've played games on a range of Macs. One of my earliest experiences was playing <i>Prince of Persia 2</i> on a 2CX. I wasn't very good and died a lot but I liked the animation and fluidity. I swiftly moved on to games like <i>SimCity 2000</i>, which was amazing. I loved the disasters and wrecking havoc on my cities.&nbsp;</p><p>I learnt to enjoy games like <i>Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego? </i>on an old Powerbook and even had fun finding shareware on the CD-ROMS <i>Macworld </i>used to include with their magazine. It was through this I discovered Bungie's <i>Marathon</i> series and the wonderful action adventure <i>Oni</i>:</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggC6kfJJE_w" width="320" youtube-src-id="ggC6kfJJE_w"></iframe></p><h3>All hail the iMac</h3><p>One of the most influential Macs I played on was the iMac. I had a 2nd generation iMac (released in 1999) and it was glorious. Beautiful to look at, it opened my eyes to games like <i>Deus Ex </i>and&nbsp;<i>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</i>. I loved the included games from Pangaea Software and have fond memories of <i>Nanosaur</i>, <i>Otto Matic</i> and <i>Cro Mag Rally</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>The ever expanding collection of shareware showed me some great games from Spiderweb Software and I loved playing the original <a href="https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/productsOld.html" target="_blank"><i>Blades of Exile</i> and <i>Avernum games</i></a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Gaming on a MacBook Pro</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, my daily driver was a hand-me-down 2007 MacBook Pro. It was a few years old by the time I got it and still in usable condition. Its ram had been upgraded to the maximum 4gb and it had a new(ish) hard drive.&nbsp;</p><p>I really wanted to play games on it and was limited by 128mb vram. The original <i>Rage</i> didn't work and games like <i>Skyrim</i> played but suffered from texture issues. Some would be missing in places, which made for an interesting experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a good time playing <i>Doom 3</i> and <i>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</i>, though. The latter was a great RPG and I had an amazing time with it. Steam ran well and I had a blast with <i>Half Life 2</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>My experience playing on Macs taught me how to make the most of whatever hardware you have. You can still have a great time no matter the platform.&nbsp;</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>On TypeScript, ESlint, jest, TSDoc, Travis-CI, and VSCode (with inspirations from the Zen of Python)</em></p>

<p>It is fun to write fast without constraints, and run code in a flash. That is why I fell in love with Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment, a great tool for prototyping and interacting with data. However, interactive notebooks fall short when you want to write bigger, maintainable code. See the <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/notebookpainpoints.html">What’s wrong with computational notebooks?</a> survey:</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/notebooks-chart.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Restructuring and cleaning up code (refactoring) is being listed as one task notebooks are not meant for. For further reading on the pros and cons of notebooks, see <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/">The First Notebook War</a>.</p>

<p>While I knew the concept of tests, I got discouraged by some overzealous test-driven development practices which make feature development slow and experimentation — even slower. In data science, you pretty much need to take an iterative approach to data. Creating meticulous tests before exploring the data is a big mistake, and will result in a well-crafted garbage-in, garbage-out pipeline. We need an environment flexible enough to encourage experiments, especially in the initial place.</p>

<p>Moreover: writing clever code is tempting! Why should you deny yourself the fun of solving a seemingly difficult problem in a one-liner? Well, there is a word of caution, and it’s called <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law">the Kernighan’s Law</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: being smart won’t make you automatically a good software engineer. The combination of high intelligence and no software engineering skills often results in code-golf-style contraptions that do the job but are completely incomprehensible for anyone else (including their authors’ future selves). This may explain the baseline <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/23237/why-are-papers-without-code-but-with-results-accepted/23238#23238">code quality in academia</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Last autumn, I got invited to the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore to lead the creation of <a href="https://github.com/Quantum-Game/">Quantum Game with Photons 2</a>. It is a bigger project, with a few people on board (with various skillsets), so things that would work for solo coding won’t fly there. And I learned a lot, by trial and error.</p>

<p>I got quite a few insights from things most software engineers take for granted: <strong>types</strong> and <strong>tests</strong>. If you are a fellow (ex-)scientist, have ADHD (I do) or for any other reason find yourself too impatient, or smart, to set types and write tests: this post is for you!</p>

<p>In this post I will discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TypeScript as an improvement over JavaScript</li>
  <li>Code documentation with TSDocs</li>
  <li>ESLint as a “spell checker” and automatic style guide for code</li>
  <li>Tests (with jest framework)</li>
  <li>Continuous integration with Travis CI and Codecov</li>
</ul>



<p>Since it is a browser-based game, JavaScript was an obvious choice. We chose <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (<em>“JavaScript with types”</em>) as its dialect, and never looked back. We all used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> open-source editor, due to its TypeScript support and rich plugin ecosystem</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pmigdal/status/1179329959598313473"><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/pmigdal-tweet-typescript.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>In principle, types are not necessary. All in all, everything in the computer is a long sequence of zeros and ones. But almost always we want to <strong>restrict</strong> what we can do with a particular variable to things that make sense, in the given context. There are exotic cases when we want to treat 0s and 1s of a <strong>float</strong> using operations for an <strong>integer</strong>, vide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">fast inverse square root</a>. But there are rare exceptions that do deserve a few extra lines of switching between types.</p>

<p>In Python, when trying to do a dubious operation, you get an error pretty soon. In JavaScript… an undefined can fly through a few layers of abstraction, causing an error in a seemingly unrelated piece of code. We can get funny results due to using different types. Open a console, write:</p>

<p><code>function add(a, b) { return +(a + b) }</code></p>

<p>And then try to <code>add(2,2)</code> and <code>add('2', 2)</code>. In both cases, you get a number… but, is it the same one? Sure, this case is trivial. But what if this function were much more complicated, had a few arguments (in non-obvious order), and its input arguments came from different functions (from modules or packages you don’t maintain)?</p>

<p>Even in Python, the error happens in the runtime. Why not see it coming while writing code? In TypeScript, with a few keystrokes, we can set:</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/typescript_add.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I found that the overhead to use types in TypeScript is minimal (if any). When writing a new class, method or function, very often it is faster. Sure, I need to specify types of input and output. But then I get speedup due to autocompletion, hints, and linting if for any reason I make a mistake.</p>

<p>Types give built-in testing — that a given function takes arguments of particular types. However, they also help greatly with the code readability. When seeing <code>changeVolume(volume: number)</code> you don’t need to guess if <code>id</code> is a number, string, boolean, <code>Volume</code> object, or Cthulhu-knows-what.</p>

<p>So, let’s start with a few lines of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

  <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>To be fair: there is quite a lot missing in TypeScript types. For example, integer types would help a lot in typical tasks such as accessing an array or iterating a loop; even if they are stored as floats, I want to make sure someone won’t take the 2.5-th element of a list.</p>

<p>Still, for me, TS is a day and night difference with JavaScript.</p>

</ul>



<p>Good comments do clarify code. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc">TSDoc</a> is a way of writing TypeScript comments where they’re linked to a particular function, class or method (like<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/"> Python docstrings</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/tsdoc2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we are clueless about what to write in the description, it may be a sign of a more fundamental problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.</p>

  <p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, it is possible to create the whole documentations with <a href="https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc">TypeDoc</a>, see <a href="https://quantum-game.github.io/quantum-tensors/classes/_operator_.operator.html">Operator for Quantum Tensors</a>.</p>

<p>Since the code runs, it is fine, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/letz.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Well, unless someone needs to read it. A collaborator, or yourself in 6 months. When the other person needs to develop it (use, expand, or rewrite) — there are so many things that can go wrong, be misunderstood, or take an unproportionate amount of time. When it comes to code, I have a strong belief that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Readability counts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://eslint/">ESLint</a> does automatic code linting — it’s “spell checking” for code and serves a few purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>marking things that are incorrect,</li>
  <li>marking things that are unnecessary or risky (e.g. <code>if (x = 5) { ... }</code>)</li>
  <li>setting a standard way of writing code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two are a no-brainer. It may be debatable what is “risky”, but we can customize that if needed.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://oppressive-silence.com/comic/oh-no-the-robots">oppressive-silence.com/comic/oh-no-the-robots</a>. Using <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-cond-assign">no-cond-assign</a> would have saved their lives.</p>

<p>The standardization is less obvious. Personally, I like setting the linter to be as strict as possible, going in line with a controversial piece of wisdom from the Zen of Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By reducing ways to write something, it reduces the number of unnecessary choices (<em>should I indent it or not?</em>) and allows me to use my cognitive resources in a more meaningful way.</p>

<p>Moreover, it makes it much easier to collaborate. No more inconsistencies because one uses <strong>tabs</strong> and the other — <strong>spaces</strong>. Or different name conventions. Even if you verbally decide to use <strong>two spaces</strong>, it takes some cognitive power to self-police oneself… with no guarantee.</p>

<p><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> can be configured in various ways, to be laid back or strictly pedantic. There are many plugins with settings for particular languages and frameworks (such as TypeScript, Vue, etc) and styles (I recommend <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/">Airbnb style JavaScript style guide</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript">Airbnb TypeScript</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many plugins go with two possible settings: base (only errors) and recommended (enforcing good practices with style). I suggest going by default for the latter. If you need to override an option, it is easy. And IMHO it does not matter nearly as much what style you choose (if you want, go for tabs for indentation — you have my official blessing) as long as it is restrictive and enforced ruthlessly.</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/prettier.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I do have a love and hate relationship with <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, another a code formatter purely focused on style. In some cases, it makes code, well, prettier and more standardized. However, for many things (say: indentations, trailing characters) Airbnb can do the job. I have also found that a restrictive approach to line width can occasionally produce an inconsistent style (and is pretty vocal about that).</p>

<p>Testing seemed the way to slow down development, kill fun and momentum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won’t fool you: tests require you to write a few more lines of code (see <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a> examples). But ask yourself: when writing a longer function, does it work on the first go? Always, no exceptions?</p>

<p>Probably you have the same doubt, and at least test it somehow: open an app and eyeball it if it works, or open a console and check if you get a correct result (this REPL / Jupyter Notebook approach for testing).</p>

<p>This interactive approach is fine… but manual. You need to do it each time you change your function. So, how about testing it once and then saving it for further use?</p>

<p>Well, with <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest">VSCode plugin for jest</a> you can do that! Write a new test and the result. If you want to make it REPL-like, instead of writing <code>console.log(x.toString())</code> use <code>expect(x.toString()).toBe('')</code> and you will directly get the result.</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/jest_test_repl.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Then, we can set it as a test. We wrote once but turned into a guardian of our code.</p>

<p>Tests do not prove that the code works. They safeguard against …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Tesla is currently valued at 10x Price-to-Sales, and Trailing Twelve Months Price-to-Earnings of 743. This makes Tesla grossly overvalued, right? In the short term, definitely yes. But is there a way this valuation will be justified in the next 10 years?</p>



<h2><strong>High level thesis</strong></h2>



<p>I believe that at the end of this decade, Tesla will be the first $1 trillion market cap car company. Except it’s not a car company. It’s a fundemental technology company.</p>



<p>Tesla is best compared to Amazon. They started as a boring book retailer. Low margins. Complicated logistics. Nothing too exciting.</p>



<p>Who would have thought in 1997 when Amazon went public that 23 years later the business would look like it does today? There was no AWS, no Amazon Advertising, no Amazon Prime, no Amazon Marketplace, no Alexa, no Kindle. In their IPO prospectus they described themselves as “the leading online retailer of books.”</p>



<p>So what was different about Amazon? Jeff Bezos. A visionary owner-operator with an extremely long-term focus and customer obsession. </p>



<p>Exactly the same is true for Tesla. It may look like a car company today. But 10 years from now it will look very differently, thanks to Elon Musk.</p>



<h2><strong>How Tesla will look like in 2030</strong></h2>



<h4><strong>Car business</strong></h4>



<p>It’s reasonable to expect that they will keep growing volume by 35 percent per year (so far it has been &gt;50 percent). That means in 2030 they will produce about 10 million cars. With an average selling price of $25k this will generate $250 billion in revenues. If we assume a similar 5 percent net income margin as Volkswagen this would generate after-tax net income of $12.5 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Software business</strong></h4>



<p>I expect each sold car to generate $10k worth of software revenues. Currently, the Full Self-Driving option alone sells for $8k, and there will be many in-app-purchases like the&nbsp;<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/12/19/tesla-acceleration-boost-model-3-dual-motor/">$2000 acceleration boost</a>, which is delivered over the air. This will generate $100 billion in revenues on top. With a net income margin of 20 percent this would add after-tax net income of $20 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Ride-sharing business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will add ride sharing capabilities, which will enable it to earn a cut (usually 20-30%) from rides on their network.</p>



<p>That means that Tesla will not just make money from cars and software, but also make money from each mile that is driven on its ride sharing network.</p>



<p>The only question is, how big will this get? If they don’t solve full self-driving, then this will just be another version of Uber/Lyft or Zipcar or Turo. It can be substantial, but probably not huge.</p>



<p>But if, and this is still a big if, they solve full self-driving and can offer fully autonomous robotaxis, this can become gigantic, especially if they are the first ones. This is not unlikely, because they have the largest fleet and by far the largest data pool to train their neural nets.</p>



<h4><strong>Solar business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla currently offers the lowest-cost solar panels in America. They plan to massively scale this business. They also offer a more premium solar roof option where the panels are directly integrated into the roof.</p>



<p>If we assume they scale this globally to 5 million roofs per year by 2030 and an average selling-price of $15k, this will bring in another $75 billion in revenues. With a 3 percent net income margin this would add $2 billion in after-tax net income.</p>



<h4><strong>Battery business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will be the undisputed leader in battery technology. Soon, they will start manufacturing their own cells, which will likely last <a href="https://www.electrek.co/2019/09/07/tesla-battery-cell-last-1-million-miles-robot-taxis/">1 million miles</a>. </p>



<p>They need cells for their cars, but also for their energy storage solutions like <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall">Powerwall</a>, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerpack">Powerpack</a> and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/megapack">Megapack</a>. </p>



<p>A Powerwall costs $8.5k and adds energy independence and backup. Pretty much every buyer of solar panels will buy one or more, which means millions of units per year. </p>



<h4><strong>Licensing business</strong></h4>



<p>The recent positive attitude by Volkswagen chairman Herbert Diess towards Tesla (see <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/vw-ceo-lauds-musk-over-tesla-s-earnings-and-value-potential">here</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/03/02/vw-chief-adjusts-goal-from-overtaking-tesla-to-keep-as-close-as-possible/">here</a>, or <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/04/29/vw-ceo-is-worried-teslas-neural-network-is-far-beyond-other-auto-manufacturers/">here</a>) can only mean one thing: Volkswagen wants to potentially license Tesla’s software and technology.</p>



<p>Elon Musk confirmed his willingness to do so:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains &amp; batteries. We’re just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1288265150928125952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It’s not realistic that every single car company in the world will be able to build all the necessary hardware and software in-house. </p>



<p>It will look more like computer or smartphone operating systems, dominated by two or three players. Tesla will be one of them, which will translate into substantial revenue.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>When we add everything up, Tesla will be a $500+ billion revenue company in 2030 with healthy profits. So I believe a valuation of $1 trillion is justified, leaving a 4x upside from today’s price. </p>



<p>And if they solve full self-driving and become the leading robotaxi provider, the revenue and profit from that will be substantial.</p>



<p>But make no mistake. There will be huge challenges and volatility. It won’t be a smooth ride. And there is still a “black swan” type chance that they will go bust.</p>



<p>If they are able to pull it off, I have no doubt in my mind that Tesla will become one of the largest and most important companies on the planet.</p>



<p>And who knows what other products or businesses they will come up with along the way?</p>

<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

Learning these modern languages and reflecting on ones I've used in the past has alerted me to the difference between a <i>Software

This post is the first of a series that describes this difference and analyses a few languages through this lens.</p><div><p>What is a Software Development Language and how is that different from a "Programming Language"?</p><p>When talking about a language, we could say that it's fast or slow, concise or verbose, mangled or pretty, beginner-friendly or plagued by a steep learning curve.

With this, the following are all programming:</p><ul><li>Writing a two-line Bash script to rename some files.</li><li>Writing a Python function to generate a plot for a Data Science class.</li><li>Editing some CSS to alter your website's layout.</li><li>Typing an SQL query into a database prompt.</li><li>Solving a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">coding challenge</a>.</li><li>Refactoring a module to use newer idioms, reducing code by half.</li><li>Writing a patch in C for the Linux Kernel to support a USB device.</li><li>Writing an algorithm prototype with an associated academic paper.</li></ul><p>And so would these be:</p><ul><li>Writing pseudocode of a sorting algorithm on a final exam.</li><li>Linking <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">visual logic blocks</a> together to cause a fun game effect.</li><li>Establishing "forms" with associated validation rules on a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> -based data management system.</li><li>The main mechanic of the game <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/">SpaceChem</a>.</li><li>Controlling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine">operation of a loom</a> via punchcards.</li><li>Taking a walk or a shower to solve coding problems in your mind.</li></ul><p>In this sense, the act of programming itself is available to everyone.</p></div><h3 id="org940e47">Definition: Software Development</h3><div><p>On the other hand, we have <i>Software Development</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Software Development is the creation of software to be used over time. It is
Programming followed by Testing, Collaborating, Releasing, and Maintenance.</p></blockquote><p>With this, the following are Software Development activities:</p><ul><li>Accepting a bug ticket at work, finding the problem, and submitting a PR for the solution.</li><li>Creating and uploading a personal website.</li><li>Developing and launching a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bubble-level-for-iphone/id465613917">phone app to help level</a> a framed picture.</li><li>Producing a game for a major gaming console.</li><li>Evaluating and merging patches to the Linux Kernel.</li><li>Updating and deploying the assembly code of a 50 year old satellite that has left the solar system.</li><li>Speaking to other developers at a conference.</li></ul><p>All languages can be measured on a scale of how sharp a tool they are for the entire Five Pillared process of Software Development, not just programming. Particularly sharp languages have solid answers to these real concerns:</p><ul><li>Programming:<ul><li>Do my ideas flow into the editor, or do the language idioms get in my way?</li><li>Is my day-to-day experience a productive dialogue with the compiler?</li><li>How many characters must I type to express my intent?</li><li>Is the language <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">filled with GOTCHAs</a>?</li><li>How short are compilation / typecheck times?</li><li>How beautiful is the syntax I look at every day?</li></ul></li><li>Testing:<ul><li>How efficiently can I discover if my code is incorrect?</li><li>Am I protected from future changes breaking old code?</li><li>Does the language itself provide correctness guarantees that avoid the need for test writing?</li><li>Are benchmarking and profiling first-class activities?</li><li>How easy does the language make it to write code that performs poorly?</li><li>How long is CI turnaround?</li></ul></li><li>Collaborating:<ul><li>How easy is it to write code that others won't understand?</li><li>When I have a question, are there well-trafficked channels to find the answer?</li><li>Is there a canonical way to write the language, or are there competing paradigms?</li><li>Can I easily incorporate other people's code into my own?</li><li>Are there meetups or conferences close to me that are dedicated to the language?</li></ul></li><li>Releasing:<ul><li>Is documentation "first class"? Are generated docs well-organized and easy to navigate?</li><li>Is it obvious how to release a library?</li><li>Are dependencies a source of strength or liability?</li><li>Is it straight-forward to produce an optimized release binary?</li><li>Are strange runtime flags necessary for sane program behaviour?</li></ul></li><li>Maintenance:<ul><li>Will code I write today be compilable in a year? In 10 years?</li><li>Can I refactor with confidence?</li><li>Should I expect frequent runtime crashes?</li><li>If I don't update my dependencies and compiler often, how soon will the ecosystem "leave me behind"?</li><li>Can the language interact with legacy code?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Naturally this list could be longer, but working software developers would likely agree with much of it. To contrast, how many of these points are relevant to students, researchers, and working scientists? This brings us to our main point:</p><blockquote><p>Some languages are better suited for Software Development than others.</p></blockquote><p>Should you write a multi-million line Operating System in Python? You could, but you shouldn't. Python has other strengths.</p><p>The same is true for working in research and for learning how to program in the first place. Should you write complex, high-performance physics simulations in Java? You could, but you shouldn't. Java has other strengths. Should you teach someone C++ as their first exposure to programming? You could (and many have been), but you shouldn't. C++ has other strengths.</p></div></div><div><p>They say that a good craftsman never blames his tools. This is true, but it's also important to recognize when you're trying to build a skyscraper with a hammer, or a bikeshed with a crane. Sometimes the tools are inappropriate for the task at hand. For Software Development, we should choose a sharp Software Development Language from our toolbox.</p><p>All Software Development Languages are Programming Languages, but the reverse is not true. With all this in mind, what sense is there really in debating the syntax of a <code>for</code> loop? Or in writing the 1000th <i>FooLang vs BarLang</i> article? Or ranking the Top 100 Languages?</p><p>For me, I'll take a language that lets me create, share my creations, and keep my creations alive. Next week, we'll apply the above philosophies to Rust, and see how it measures as a Software Development Language.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>"encoding/xml"</span>
    <span>"os"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>type</span> <span>document</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>docs</span> <span>:=</span> <span>dump</span><span>.</span><span>Documents</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>docs</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>docs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>ID</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>docs</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>strings</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span><span>(</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is - <span><span>(?i)\bcat\b</span></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>
</ul>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

</p></div>
<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>strings</span><span>.</span><span>FieldsFunc</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>rune</span><span>)</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Split on any character that is not a letter or a number.

</div>
<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<h4>Stemming<a href="#stemming" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Because of the grammar rules, documents may include different forms of the same word.
Stemming reduces words into their base form. For example, <em>fishing</em>, <em>fished</em> and <em>fisher</em> may be reduced to the base form (stem) <em>fish</em>.</p>

<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>

<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>price</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span>

<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 18.413 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_customer_fk</span>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what Arjun Guha and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p><em>This post describes a Sudoku solver in Python. Even the most challenging Sudoku puzzles can be quickly and efficiently solved with depth first search and constraint propagation.</em></p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<figure>

  <figcaption>A minimal Sudoku puzzle </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Recently the Sudoku bug bit me.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Wikipedia</a>, this popular brain teaser puzzle rose to prominence in 2004. “Sudoku” is Japanese for “single number”.
The goal of Sudoku is to full a 9x9 grid where each row, column and 3x3 region contains each of the numbers from 1 to 9. 
These puzzles range in difficulty, and some can be surprisingly hard to solve by hand. But all are remarkably easy to solve with computers.</p>

<h3 id="other-solvers">Other solvers</h3>

<p>After a few days of manually playing Sudoku, I naturally decided to write a solver for it.
I tackled this problem by myself, before comparing it to other online solvers.</p>

<p>There are two articles I would like to mention that were particularly helpful.
The first article is by <a href="https://dev.to/aspittel/how-i-finally-wrote-a-sudoku-solver-177g">Ali Spittel</a>. I liked the overall structure of her code, and used it to refactor some of mine.
Her code however cannot solve hard puzzles because it only follows a simple constraint propagation strategy.
The second article is by <a href="https://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Peter Norvig</a>.
He uses a more comprehensive search and constraint propagation strategy and provides a thorough analysis with multiple puzzles. 
I used his set of <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/sudoku_top95.txt">95 hard puzzles</a> and <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/sudoku_hardest.txt">11 hardest puzzles</a> to test my code. 
However, I found his structure unintuitive. For example, he stores the board as a dictionary instead of a 9x9 array.</p>

<p>Raghav Virmani’s augmented reality <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robovirmani_computervision-ai-ml-activity-6676143042518507520-c2pG">solver</a> is very cool. This program solves and overlays solutions on pictures of unsolved Sudokus in real time. 
It does this by combining Norvig’s solver with a Convolutional Neural Network that can read pictures of numbers.</p>

<p>There are many solvers which refrain from search or any other trial and error strategies.
One of the more complex of these is Andrew Stuart’s <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm">solver</a> which implements 38 different strategies for solving Sudokus.
A major drawback of this type of solver is, despite the complexity, it cannot solve every type of Sudoku puzzle.</p>

<h2 id="2-difficulty-levels">2. Difficulty levels</h2>

<p>Before describing my solver, I’d like to give a quick overview of difficulty levels in Sudoku. 
I’ve gained an appreciation of them over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The difficulty levels are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Easy to Hard</li>
  <li>Very hard</li>
  <li>Ultra-hard</li>
  <li>Impossible</li>
</ol>

<p>This is from a human viewpoint. Because the solver uses search, these levels don’t affect its performance. For a computer, all puzzles can be described as “easy”.</p>

<p>This section only considers puzzles with a unique solution or no solution. 
Any given Sudoku puzzle might have multiple solutions, but most published Sudokus only have one.
My solver can find all solutions for any given puzzle.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-hard-puzzles">Easy to hard puzzles</h3>

<p>The New York Times publishes daily Sudokus at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/">www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/</a>. There are three levels: easy, medium and hard.
Here is an example of an easy puzzle (left) and a hard puzzle (right).</p>

<p><img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/NYTimes_easy.png" alt="Sudoku impossible"> 
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/NYTimes_hard.png" alt="Sudoku impossible by Norvig">
</p>


<p>The easy puzzle has 39 clues. At the start, there are 13 singles. These are cells where there is a candidate that is unique to that row, column, or box.
These can be filled in immediately. This will create other singles, until the very end of the puzzle. I can solve such a puzzle in 3-5 minutes.</p>

<p>The hard puzzle has 23 clues. At the start, there are only 2 singles. To solve the rest of the puzzle, one should compare rows, columns and boxes to eliminate candidates. 
It is very easy to rediscover the other basic <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm">strategies</a>: pairs, triples, pointing pairs and box-line reduction.
I can solve these puzzles in 20-30 minutes.</p>

<p>It is enough to use the simplest of these strategies combined with depth first search to solve any Sudoku puzzle very quickly.</p>

<h3 id="very-hard-puzzles">Very hard puzzles</h3>

<p>People however like to challenge themselves. Is it possible to solve a hard Sudoku without any guessing? 
There are many more complex strategies for solving Sudoku puzzles. For example, constructing chains across multiple rows, columns and boxes to eliminate candidates.
Or comparing multiple cells and candidate combinations to eliminate only a single candidate.
In general, it is more work for less.</p>

<p>Some puzzles require at least one of these strategies for solving (with no guessing).
Andrew Stuart rates them from Tough to Extreme to Diabolical. I don’t solve these puzzles.</p>

<p>Here is a diabolical puzzle with 26 clues:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Stuart_diabolical.png" alt="Sudoku minimal">
</figure>

<p>This one is particularly nasty. Try put it in Stuart’s <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm?bd=..31..72.7.....5...5.24..3....72......6...8......14....6..95.8...5.....9.49..26..">solver</a>. It takes multiple steps of small eliminations before the puzzle can be solved.
Meanwhile my solver takes only six guesses to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="ultra-hard-puzzles">Ultra-hard puzzles</h3>

<p>Ok. So you’ve become a Sudoku master. You abhor guessing.
You’ve learnt all the complex techniques. You can create chains across the entire board and <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sword_Fish_Strategy">swordfishes</a>
remind you of your more innocent days.
Can you now solve every possible puzzle with logic alone? No guessing? It turns out, no. Stuart himself posts weekly ‘<a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Weekly_Sudoku.asp">unsolvables</a>’.
These puzzles cannot be solved with his logic-only solver. But they are very much solvable with search.</p>

<p>In 2012, this 21-clue puzzle by mathematician Arto Inkala was labelled the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9359579/Worlds-hardest-sudoku-can-you-crack-it.html">hardest Sudoku puzzle</a> in the world:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Inkala_hardest.png" alt="Sudoku minimal">
</figure>

<p>Is it the hardest? I do not know. But it is certainly a monster. At the very start, one cell has two candidates, and the rest have three.
You’re forced to make a guess in the cell with the two candidates. And then at best, another two guesses before you can use any of the techniques in Stuart’s solver.
That is a $1$ in $2^3 = 8$ probability of guessing correctly with no wrong guesses. My solver takes 39 guesses to solve this, of which 29 are wrong<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>.
So in other words, even an amateur like me can solve the hardest Sudoku puzzle in the world by hand, as long as they are willing to do it 40 times.</p>

<h3 id="impossible-puzzles">Impossible puzzles</h3>

<p>If you search for this term on the internet, you’ll probably find a lot of hard, but certainly solvable, Sudokus. 
People like to exaggerate the difficulty of these puzzles. 
There is, however, a very large set of puzzles that are truly impossible.
They’re trivially easy to construct. The easiest way to do so, is to play a game of Sudoku and make a mistake XD.
Here are two puzzles which are impossible from the start:</p>

<p><img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Simple_impossible.png" alt="Sudoku impossible"> 
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Norvig_impossible.png" alt="Sudoku impossible by Norvig">
</p>


<p>Very amusingly, Norvig passed the puzzle on the right to his solver, and it took almost 24 minutes to conclude that it was impossible.
His solver otherwise takes less than a second to solve ultra-hard Sudokus. 
As an amateur Sudoku player, it took me less than a minute to verify that it was impossible<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="3-code">3. Code</h2>
<h3 id="general-algorithm">General algorithm</h3>
<p>To solve even the most challenging of these puzzles, our Sudoku solver only needs to follow three strategies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a square has only one candidate, place that value there.</li>
  <li>If a candidate is unique within a row, box or column, place that value there (hidden singles).</li>
  <li>If neither 1 or 2 is true in the entire grid, make a guess. Backtrack if the Sudoku becomes unsolvable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to check number 2, we have to keep a list of candidates for each block, and update it as values are placed.
This adds complexity. We could leave it out - the solver will require more guesses but will still work. 
However it is easy to find these hidden singles and this step makes the algorithm much faster.
So the added complexity is well justified.</p>

<h3 id="sudoku-class">Sudoku class</h3>

<p>My Sudoku class stores two 9x9 arrays: one is for integers with the final value and another is for candidate values.
I also wrote a few helper functions to extract rows, columns and boxes from the grid. 
The <code>__repr__</code> function overrides the default string for the <code>print</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="candidate-functions">Candidate functions</h3>

<p>These functions are for editing the <code>candidates</code> array. They are also part of the <code>Sudoku</code> class.</p>

<p>Below is the <code>find_options</code> function which is called by <code>__init__</code>. 
I’ve chosen to work with the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">set</a> type for working with candidates.
The set functions <code>union</code> (operator <code>|</code>) and difference (operator <code>-</code>) make it easy to find distinct candidates between intersecting rows, columns and boxes.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>find_options</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>:</span>

<p>As we place values, we’ll need to erase them as candidates in neighbouring blocks. 
This might then unlock new values elsewhere, so it is useful to do constraint propagation at the same time. 
While there are many different strategies for constraint propagation,
it is sufficient to use only the simplest strategy, hidden singles.</p></div></div></div></div>

Once you start paying attention to the details, you’ll realize other humans are the most interesting thing in the world.</p> <p><strong>Counter-position.</strong> Don’t try to compete with their fantasy. Like Kellyanne Conway answering a question, just pitch a different one. If you suspect someone the fantasy in the future job is “I will make more money”, don’t immediately offer a raise. Pitch another something else, e.g: “there will be real opportunity for public recognition in this role”. <span>Don’t make your idea comparable to another idea.</span></p> <p><strong>Direct a movie.</strong> Suppose you want someone to quit smoking. The fantasy you want to plant is how youthful they’ll feel when they stop. The most effective way to incept a person isn’t to say those words. Instead, say something like: “it must feel wonderful to run 3 miles in the wilderness, take a breath of fresh air and really live life.” <span>Conduct a movie in the mind with words that evoke vivid imagery.</span> It makes for a much more engaging conversation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t pre-suppose solutions.</strong> Instead of thinking of what you want (“you should build this thing”), think of <em>why</em> you want it (“this thing could be really successful, if someone built it”). Try to formulate a narrative around the underlying motivations for the idea, and let them think of the actual concept themselves. <span>Give context, not commands.</span></p> <p><strong>Run a simulation.</strong> Think to yourself: “what would I be thinking if I was in that position?” To do this well, you must disentangle your own motivations. <span>Take your hat off. Put theirs on. Argue against yourself with them.</span> This helps convey that you’re really trying to see the problem from their side.</p> <p><strong>Pitch theoretically.</strong> When you’re in a biased position, don’t make any direct suggestions (“you should”). Your idea may get auto-rejected because of its origin. Instead, use yourself or a theoretical stranger (“I would…”, “boy <em>somebody</em> ought to…”).</p> <p><strong>Lastly, forget about yourself.</strong> <span>People frequently make the mistake of pitching ideas that will help them, not the other party.</span> This doesn’t work. Smart people have a very strong firewall for truly embracing an idea. To pass it you must really afford the other party something that they deeply want. Not what you want. That is a secondary goal.</p> </article></div>]]>

Introduction
      </p>
      <p>
An article http://eed3si9n.com/console-games-in-scala
<br>
 - describes control sequences that allow to print in any arbitrary location on the screen, rather than in line-by-line manner
<br>
 - describes how to read arrow button press events
      </p>
      <p>
decided to implement in haskell, wrote some preliminary code that reads arrow button presses from console, didn't know how to write tetris in functional style, came across a comment about fs2, been reading about iteratee, postponed tetris, lost preliminary code.
      </p>
      <p>
have read a book "Learn you a haskell for great good" (LYAH)
      </p>
      <p>
an idea was suggested to write tetris, implemented it in java, then decided to translate it to haskell.
      </p>

      <p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>
      <p>
Project structure
      </p>

      <p>
<code>figure</code>, <code>arena</code>, <code>ConsoleView</code>, <code>main</code>
      </p>

      <p>
a figure is implemented as an immutable structure, instead of rewriting a field value returns another version of itself.
      </p>

      <p>
an arena stores playing field cells and a figure.
      </p>

      <p>
a <code>ConsoleView</code> prints an arena to the console.
      </p>

      <p>
<code>main</code> glues everything together: reading of input symbols, reaction to commands, showing an arena, starting and stopping a timer.
      </p>

      <p>
first implemented without a timer, and after that added a timer and concurrency.
      </p>

      <p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>
      <p>
Concurrency
      </p>

      <p>
there is a channel (concurrent queue)
<br>
a timer sends a "tick" command to the channel
<br>
a recursive <code>keys2commands</code> function translates read symbols into commands, which it then sends to channel
<br>
some function reads commands from the channel and passes them to the <code>handleTetrisCommand</code> function which reacts to them
<br>
<code>handleTetrisCommand</code> receives game state and a command as an input, shows an arena and returns the next state of a game
      </p>

      <p>
two ways of repeatedly invoking <code>handleTetrisCommand</code>:
<br>
 - using recursive function
<br>
 - using <code>foldM</code>
      </p>

      <p>
when <code>handleTetrisCommand</code> is invoked by <code>foldM</code>, it works because lists are lazy in haskell
      </p>

      <p>

      <div><p>
Conclusions

</p><p>

specific and abstract
<br>
haskell is not as strictly functional as I thought

      <p>
What's next?
      </p>

      <p>
what part of code is pure functional and what part is not pure?
      </p>

      <p>
exit game functionality is not implemented yet, one way of exiting game is through interrupting the console
      </p>
      <p>
optimize changing values in cells matrix
      </p>
      <p>
how to introduce more functional stuff into code, like monads, monad transformers, etc.?

Introduction
      </p>

      <p>
There's a tradition to print Hello World to the console when beginning learning a language. Let's call printing Hello World to the console a first level of interactivity. A next level is when a program gets an input from a user and prints the result to the console. Sounds similar to the way functions work.
      </p>

      <p>
One of the merits of a functional style is said to be the fact that functions don't produce side effects. Side effects have the potential to over-complicate the code, making it resemble a bowl of spagetti (it is called spagetti-code), and unwanted side effects are errors, bugs. When we use functions, we don't have side effects, so from the beginning we eliminate the possibility of introducing an unwanted side effect into the code.
      </p>

      <p>
Sounds convincing, but what does it look like in practice when we're dealing with something more sophisticated than Hello World or a console calculator?
      </p>

      <p>
We want to write something complex and intertwined in functional style and check if spagetti is going to get untangled because we used functions, and if so, what will it look like?
      </p>

      <p>
Are we going to write some UI or a server, or maybe an operation system kernel? It would be too far of a jump on a learning curve, which seems to be pretty steep in haskell's case. We got to flatten the learning curve.
      </p>
      <p>
It's got to be console application. But here is a thing: how are we going to test if functions help us untangle the code, given that console works similar to functions in line-by-line input-output mode?
      </p>

      <p>
This article helps us resolve the problem: http://eed3si9n.com/console-games-in-scala
      </p>
      <p>
It describes:
<br>
 - control sequences of symbols that let us print in any location on screen, rather than line by line.
<br>
 - how to read arrow button pressed events.
      </p>

      <p>
In this way it's possible to use console on a higher level of interactivity.
      </p>

      <p>
After having read the article, I decided to translate the code to haskell, wrote some preliminary code that reads arrow button presses from console, and reacts to them by moving a figure on a screen.
      </p>
      <p>
An article proceeds by adding a code that periodically prints some text. The program's flow got divided into several threads working concurrently. I didn't know how to write something like that in haskell. The learning curve jumped high and became a wall in front of me. Actually it was me who made things more complicated, because I've been searching in the wrong place.
      </p>
      <p>
In the comment to an article someone mentioned fs2 library, I started searching it's equivalent for haskell and reading about the library. I've read in some discussion that the library consists of a set of instruments and there are various options of how to use each of them, developers have coded some of the options, but there are too many combinations of instruments and options to code each one, come up with a name for it, describe it in a documentation and make users memorise all the names. That strange situation discouraged me from using the library.
      </p>

      <p>
I kept the preliminary code only on hard disk, never uploaded it to any kind of cloud, and it so happened that it was lost. Perhaps you need to upload code into repos on cloud, even if it's just some draft code you are playing with. Sometimes such little things determine whether you keep progressing or procractinating.
      </p>

      <p>
Later I came across an idea of iteratees and got an impression that they are related to a functional style.
      </p>
      <p>
EDIT: actually, I forgot that I've read about fs2 and iteratees in this article that was written as a response to "Console games in Scala" article, in which the code was refactored to get rid of global shared mutable state: http://m50d.github.io/2018/09/12/streaming-console-game
      </p>
      <p>
Iteratees were implemented in haskell first, and then were adopted in other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
In search results I saw links to articles about iteratees on scala, skimmed through it, but I wanted to get the knowledge from the root, so to speak. I needed articles about iteratees on haskell.
I followed the link from the wikipedia article to an article in "The Monad Reader" journal. "Iteratee: Teaching an Old Fold New Tricks" by John W. Lato ( https://themonadreader.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/issue-16 ).
      </p>
      <p>
In that article the author created a data type, created Monad, Applicative and Functor instances for the data type and suggested to figure out the flow of execution of one method (&gt;&gt;=) as an exercise. I tried to do that, got lost in intricacies of function invokations and now iteratees seem to me like something complicated and tricky. Are newbie's brains too OOP to understand that stuff or maybe that article is a little too advanced? I think I was lucky enough to bump into the wrong article.
      </p>

      <p>
Are exercices a good or a bad thing? They are a good thing if you know how to use them as a tool. They are bad when the inner perfectionist refuses to continue with the job until the exercise is done, but doesn't want to do the exercise.
      </p>

      <p>
This dead-end branch of learning ended by me switching focus to scala because of an interview. Just a vague feeling remained that I wanted to write tetris on haskell and didn't know how to do that; that in order to do that I needed to understand how iteratees work and finish a hard and confusing exercise. Haskell is so hard to learn! In fact, I didn't even need iteratees to write tetris. This is an example of how the wrong strategy of learning can lead to a dead end and demotivate. Seems like being able to simplify the task at hand is a skill too, and you need to learn and train yourself to simplify things.
      </p>

      <p>
Have read the "Learn you a haskell for great good" (LYAH) book. An easy to read, engaging and interesting book.
      </p>
      <p>
I heard that there aren't much books and articles like that in haskell world. Maybe I'm just not very skilled in finding good articles. Do readers have any recommendations?
      </p>

      <p>
I decided to take a break from anything related to programming, later I started reading books to refresh memory, but didn't code because I could not come up with any project idea, all ideas seemed boring, not interesting enough to start coding.
      </p>

<p><span>O</span>n June 23, Jiang opened an app called 58 Tongcheng and saw a public poll: “I quit my job in January and have been laying low at home so far. How about your first half of 2020?”</p>



<p>She suddenly got emotional. Jiang, who asked to be identified by her last name only, is 27 and lives in Nanjing, a city of eight million people in eastern China. In February, her employer of four years, a small clinic that offers beauty treatments like Botox, laid off all three of its staff workers, on account of pandemic-related economic pressure. Jiang, who had attended only vocational training after high school, found it hard to get a new job. She worked briefly for a hospital call center but quit when she was ordered to lure patients in with false promises. She enrolled in a skills-training program that cost $3,000 but felt she learned nothing new. When Jiang clicked on 58 Tongcheng’s poll, she wrote in the comments, “I’ve used up all my savings. I have no idea what to do tomorrow ever since I became unemployed. Feeling kind of lost.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng <a href="http://bj.58.com/">is the Chinese version of Craigslist</a> and one of the most popular websites for classifieds and job posts. But, this year, users like Jiang have turned 58 Tongcheng into a repository for unemployment grief. In the absence of media documentation of the economic upheaval created by Covid-19, the app has become an unofficial record of the depth of the country’s devastation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officially, the Chinese <a href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/statsinfo/auto2074/202004/t20200417_1739478.html">unemployment rate has been remarkably stable</a>: 5.7% in June, less than 1% higher than the same time last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. But that number has drawn suspicion from both inside and outside China. In April, Li Xunlei, then director of the research unit for Chinese security brokerage firm Zhongtai, published a report estimating a national unemployment rate of around 20%. He was <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-01/zhongtai-securities-removes-research-chief-after-controversial-report-101549484.html">removed</a> from the position one week later, a decision Zhongtai claims was not related to the report.</p>



<p>Poor workers have been hit especially hard by the economic turmoil. A team of researchers led by Lu Hai, a professor of accounting at both Peking University and the University of Toronto, found that, based on public job posts, the number of available positions with a monthly salary less than 4,000 yuan (about $570) has decreased this year by 44% compared to the same period in 2019. On the upper end of the economic spectrum, the number of posts advertising jobs with compensation higher than 15,000 yuan (about $2,140), was down by only 12%. (The average monthly salary in urban regions of China was about $1,100 in 2019.) One <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/blog/lockdowns-are-protecting-chinas-rural-families-covid-19-economic-burden-heavy">study</a> of Chinese villages around Hubei, the first epicenter of the virus, found that inhabitants were spending less on food because of economic difficulty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Helping the low-income population in China is quite challenging,” Lu wrote in an email to <em>Rest of World</em>. “These are the most vulnerable people and businesses when there is a significant negative shock.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng, or 58.com, is uniquely positioned to shine a light on disadvantaged communities. Founded in 2005 by Jinbo Yao, a young entrepreneur who started out selling domain names, the company started as a website for people to post and find housing leads, job notices, and items for sale. It sells ads on its platform and charges businesses and individuals $1,000 to $8,000 for a yearly membership that allows them to boost their posts or listings. An app launched in 2010 does the same. It is now among the top 30 Chinese apps by number of users, according to the data analytics firm QuestMobile.</p>



<p>Recruitment is one of 58 Tongcheng’s core services. It is especially popular among blue-collar workers and their employers. In 2017, Yao told the business magazine <em>China Entrepreneur</em> that the company has a 90% market share in online blue-collar recruitment. (Many blue-collar workers still find jobs through offline connections.) That same year, the company launched 58 Town, a separate app targeting small-town populations, as part of a strategic push to attract users in China’s less-developed regions. 58 Town has ventured into 13,000 of China’s approximately 40,000 towns, according to the company’s 2019 annual report. Last year, more than half of 58 Tongcheng’s core business revenue was generated outside of the top 19 cities. (At the time of publication, the company was still listed on the New York Stock Exchange.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng’s social network feature, launched last year, is designed to give users the chance to chat outside the job search. In these “58 communities,” users talk under pseudonyms about shared experiences. Some of the most popular forums include “life as a laborer,” “all about job seeking,” and “family of restaurant workers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really a place where [users] discuss things quite freely and find a sense of community online,” Yao explained to a May 2019 earnings call to analysts, translated from Mandarin to English by 58 Tongcheng’s Chief Financial Officer, Hao Zhou. Complaints are common. “Sometimes they are under pressure,” Yao explained. “They don’t have an outlet for some of the steam or just a place to find people [who] have similar feedback or a place to find comfort.” The company did not respond to <em>Rest of World</em>’s interview request.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what’s happening now in the aftermath of the first wave of the pandemic. After losing her job, Jiang used the 58 Tongcheng app because she heard from others that it was a helpful recruitment platform. After several frustrating days of job hunting, she needed to vent her negative energy. Overnight, more than 100 people commented on her post, sharing their own experiences of being laid off or scammed by training programs.</p>



<p>Jiang found comfort in what she read. “I was having so much anxiety, but then I saw that everyone is in the same situation,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Every day, hundreds of people, like Jiang, now use the 58 Tongcheng app to share their experiences of unemployment. Not every post receives equal attention. Some are marked as quality content and placed on the front page. Others are quickly ignored. Four days after her post, Jiang wrote another one, asking for job or apprenticeship leads. It was viewed only 70 times; no one replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few conversations have trickled out of the app into the public conversation. But last month, a Chinese photographer who goes by the alias Fennu Yinhang (<a href="https://weibo.com/5625216939/J566W4nWg?type=comment#_rnd1594845115454">@愤怒银行</a>) posted screenshots on Weibo and called them “Unemployment Notes on 58 Tongcheng.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Fennu Yinhang, the screenshots contained some of the app’s most popular posts. In one, a woman describes spending $10 on cosmetics and picking out her best outfit to interview for salesperson positions. “I don’t care what I will be selling,” she writes, “as long as it’s a sales job.” Another complained that, being 45, she was excluded from all the jobs requiring applicants to be between 18 and 42. (Age discrimination is legal in China.) But her son had reassured her on the phone: “Mom, you are great. They failed to see your value.”</p>



<p>This post quickly went viral, in part because so few users on Weibo — who are typically white-collar — seem to realize how bad the unemployment situation for blue-collar workers is. In comments on the post, many were coming to terms with the extent of China’s unemployment crisis. “We need to be able to talk about poems, about the trending topic BLM, about aesthetics, photography, fashion, coffee bean types, and whiskey producers,” one of the top comments reads, “but we also need to see the pain and dilemma of people around us.”</p>



<p>Still, discussions of the severity of mass unemployment remain scarce on social media — and among Chinese leaders.</p>



<p>Since the pandemic first broke out in December, the Chinese government has taken small steps toward helping workers. This month, it organized its first-ever <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-07/02/content_5523428.htm">civilian-run Company Recruitment Month</a><strong> </strong>to match unemployed workers with jobs in the private sector. 58 Tongcheng pitched in, hosting a <a href="https://hrgactivity.58.com/render/minyingqiyezhaopinyue/home">virtual hiring expo</a> for the service industry, along with other platforms. But government policies, as they exist now, have many flaws. The vast majority of jobless workers — about 90% — are not eligible for unemployment benefits, resulting in a mass underestimation of the unemployment numbers. Xi Jinping made poverty eradication by 2020 one of his goals; now it looks like <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/impact-covid-19-coronavirus-global-poverty-why-sub-saharan-africa-might-be-region-hardest">the numbers will only increase</a>.</p>



<p>In the absence of an open conversation about the effects of the economic downturn, 58 Tongcheng users have turned the app into a channel to express and document their frustration. Away from the media spotlight, this corner of the internet may find its greatest value in illustrating the true depth of pandemic despair.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article><main><a href="https://pento.ai/blog/scaling-computer-vision-dataflow"><p>Scaling Computer Vision models with Dataflow</p></a><nav><span><span><span></span><span>3d<!-- --> ago</span><span>July 28, 2020<!-- --> (<!-- -->3d<!-- --> ago)</span></span></span></nav></main><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/dataflow.webp"></p><p>We will shortly introduce the Google Cloud service <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a>, and how it can be used to run predictions on millions of images in a serverless way. No cluster creation, no maintenance, and you only pay for what you use. We will start by providing a context on why we think this is important, a brief introduction to a couple of concepts and then go directly into a use case.</p><p>Scaling Machine Learning models is hard and expensive. It is costly mainly for two reasons: because the infrastructure is expensive, and because your experimentation pipeline is slow causing your ML team to be constantly waiting for the results.</p><p>It is easy to underestimate how is expensive it is to have an ML team waiting for results. Not only because of the time wasted but also because people get frustrated and end up losing motivation.</p><p>One way to optimize your ML experimentation process it is to build and manage your own infrastructure. This is common in big companies, but this is often prohibitively expensive for smaller companies.</p><p>Traditional software development had similar challenges years ago, companies needed to scale, mainly driven by business needs (slow services/API/website don't scale). Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to provide services that allow companies to scale without upfront costs. They mainly approach this issue in two ways: services that are easier to manage and serverless services. The latter were particularly attractive for small companies that didn't have a big DevOps team or much money to pay for their own infrastructure.</p><p>A similar trend is happening in Machine Learning. This time is driven by the scarcity and high cost of ML talent. Like SW, small companies can't invest a huge amount of money to create a custom optimized infrastructure to ML, it requires a team of experts to build it and maintain it.</p><p>Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to add value similarly by providing Serverless solutions to ML. GCP, in particular, has done this for a while. GCP AI Platform offers different services for each stage of an ML project. But they also count on other services that can help solve ML challenges.</p><a id="what_is_dataflow?" href="#what_is_dataflow?"><h2>What is Dataflow?</h2></a><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a> is a fully managed processing service, that uses <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> as its programming model to define and execute pipelines. Dataflow is one of the <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/">many runners</a> that Beam supports.</p><blockquote><p>Apache Beam provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.</p></blockquote><p>Dataflow in particular has some interesting features:</p><ul><li>Fully managed</li><li>Autoscaling</li><li>Easy implementation</li></ul><a id="what_is_apache_beam?" href="#what_is_apache_beam?"><h2>What is Apache Beam?</h2></a><p>As mentioned above, Beam is a programming model used to define and execute a processing pipeline. It provides an interface to create a processing pipeline that can be executed in multiple environments (such as Spark, Hadoop, Dataflow).</p><a id="use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50" href="#use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50"></a><p>As Computer Vision engineers, we often need to extract embeddings using a CNN model. Here we will present how to build a Dataflow pipeline that generates image feature embedding using a pre-trained ResNet50. Our pipeline will consist of 3 simple steps:</p><ol><li>Load images</li><li>Extract features</li><li>Store features</li></ol><p>To implement our pipeline we are going to use the Apache Beam Python SDK, Keras, Pillow, and Click. Because we will use non-python dependencies we have to structure our code as it is described <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#nonpython">here</a>.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is create a pipeline configuration:</p><pre><pre><code>if local:
    # Execute pipeline in your local machine.
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DirectRunner",
    }
else:
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DataflowRunner",
        "temp_location": "...",
        "staging_location.": "...",
        "max_num_workers": max_num_workers,
    }

options = PipelineOptions(
      project=project_id,
      job_name=job_name,
      region=region,
      **runner_options
  )

options.view_as(SetupOptions).save_main_session = True
options.view_as(SetupOptions).setup_file = os.path.join(
    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute(), "..", "setup.py")
</code></pre></pre><p>As you can see the options change depending on whether we are executing the pipeline locally or on Dataflow.</p><p>Then we need to create a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline">Pipeline</a>:</p><pre><pre><code>with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
        ...
</code></pre></pre><p><code>p</code> is our pipeline, to add new steps to the pipeline use the operator <code>|</code> as follow:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | Task();
</code></pre></pre><p>If you want to explicitly name the step you can use the operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code>:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | ("task_name" &gt;&gt; Task());
</code></pre></pre><p>And now we need to specify the steps for our pipeline. There are multiple ways to implement it:</p><ul><li>Built-in implementations: BigQuery connector, ReadFile, etc.</li><li>Custom implementation: Map, Filter, ParDo</li></ul><pre><pre><code>(p
 | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
 | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
 | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)
 | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
</code></pre></pre><p>Here you can see we have added the three steps mentioned above. We are loading the paths to the images from a CSV file in Google Cloud, then we load the images, extract their embedding, and store them in Google Cloud Storage.</p><p>In all the steps in our pipeline we expect to receive one input and return one output. To apply these type steps we must use the method <code>beam.Map</code>. Alternatively, If you are dealing with steps that could potentially receive/return zero or more inputs/outputs, you could use <code>beam.ParDo</code>.</p><p>Now that the pipeline is defined, let's take a look at implementations.</p><a id="loading_images" href="#loading_images"><h3>Loading images</h3></a><p>At this step, we need to download the image from GCS, load it as a Pillow Image, resize it, and convert it into a numpy array object. The reason why we download and resize in a single step, is that we want to reduce the data transferred between steps in the pipeline, thus decreasing the cost.</p><pre><pre><code>def load(path):
    """
    Receives an image path and returns a dictionary containing
    the image path and a resized version of the image as a np.array.
    """
    buf = GcsIO().open(path, mime_type="image/jpeg")
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(buf.read()))
    img = img.resize((IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH), Image.ANTIALIAS)
    return {"path": path, "image": np.array(img)}
</code></pre></pre><p>Beam provides a set of <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/">built-in Connector</a> to handle I/O.</p><a id="extracting_features" href="#extracting_features"><h3>Extracting features</h3></a><p>In this step, we need to load the ResNet model and run the predictions. To avoid loading the model multiple times on the same worker, a singleton wrapper was added to the <code>FeatureExtractor</code> class. Once we extract the embedding, we add it to the item dictionary, and as we do not longer need to have the full image loaded in memory, we remove it from dictionary.</p><pre><pre><code>def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]

    return get_instance

@singleton
class Extractor:
    """
    Extract image embeddings using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = ResNet50(
            input_shape=(IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, 3),
            include_top=False,
            weights="imagenet",
            pooling=None,
        )

    def extract(self, image):
        return self.model.predict(np.expand_dims(image, axis=0))[0]

def extract(item):
    """
    Extracts the feature embedding from item["image"].
    """
    extractor = Extractor()
    item["embedding"] = extractor.extract(item["image"])
    # We do not longer need the image, remove it from the dictonary to free memory.
    del item["image"]
    return item
</code></pre></pre><a id="storing_features" href="#storing_features"><h3>Storing features</h3></a><p>Now that we have the embedding we just need to store it in GCS.</p><pre><pre><code>def store(item, output_path):
    """
    Store the image embeddings item["embedding"] in GCS.
    """
    name = item["path"].split("/")[-1].split(".")[0]
    path = os.path.join(output_path, f"{name}.npy")

    fin = io.BytesIO()
    np.save(fin, item["embedding"])

    fout = beam.io.gcp.gcsio.GcsIO().open(path, mode="w")
    fin.seek(0)
    fout.write(fin.read())
</code></pre></pre><p>Dataflow allows you to specify the machine type, number of workers, objective, etc, providing a lot of flexibility to find the right configuration for the task at hand. You can check all the options <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">here</a>.</p><p>Once you run your Dataflow pipeline you will see logs about the status of the execution in your machine. Another alternative is to use Dataflow web UI. You can learn more about it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-monitoring-intf">on its doccumentation</a>.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/dataflow-pipeline.webp" alt="Dataflow UI"></p><p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/dataflow-demo">full code here</a>.</p><p>Apache Beam also supports branching your pipeline. Let's say you want to create 2D visualizations of your embedding, you can do this by branching your pipeline in the following way:</p><pre><pre><code>p = (
   p
     | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
     | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
     | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)))

(p | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
(p | "reduce_dim" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(reduce_dim))
</code></pre></pre><p>This allows Beam to execute <code>store</code> and <code>reduce_dim</code> independently, providing more flexibility to optimize the pipeline, and therefore improving its performance.</p><a id="scale" href="#scale"></a><p>Dataflow provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">multiple configurations</a> that allow you to customize the way you want to scale, in a really easy way. By default, it chooses the values that improve performance. During the execution itself, Dataflow changes the configuration to optimize the performance, changing, for instance, the number of workers, the machine type, etc.</p><p>You can let Dataflow find out what is the best configuration each time you run the pipeline. But if you already know what your jobs need, such as the amount of RAM, or whether it is CPU intensive, what is the maximum throughput supported by your external services (i.e.: your DB or API capacity), it is better to specify this information directly. This will help Dataflow converge faster into the right configuration, speeding up the executing and reducing costs.</p><p>Dataflow should be enough to cover most of small/medium size companies requirements to scale. To have a number as reference, Dataflow is able to execute the use case presented above at rate of 5k images per seconds, using up to 1k workers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You got a new dog, he’s very smart. So you decided to call him Brain. You love Brain, he’s your best friend now, and you always do things together. Everything would be perfect if Brain didn’t have this little problem; He gets distracted very easily, and when you go out for a walk, he pulls you around. No matter how tight you hold the leash, he always wins. It doesn’t stop there, and most often you find yourself following Brain rather than the other way around.</p><p>You are so frustrated, you can’t get anything done. Brain always wants to eat, play, or go outside to chase squirrels. You had enough, it’s time to train Brain, take control, and show him who is in charge!</p><p>The first step to changing Brain’s behavior is understanding why the behavior is happening.</p><h2>How Dogs Learn</h2><p>Training dogs is all about teaching them that you are the Alpha, and then using psychological techniques to reinforce their learning around key behaviors. The three different types of learning I’ll address here are called <strong>classical conditioning</strong>, <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, and <strong>social learning</strong>.</p><h3>Conditioned Behavior</h3><p>Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, through experiments with dogs and published in 1897. In one of his most famous experiments, Pavlov offered food to dogs and rang a bell at the same time. Over time, the dogs began to salivate (an unconscious response to food) not only when food was offered, but also when the bell was rung.</p><figure id="w-node-7408c90152ab-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f1b2f8837dee2e4604d0561_Group.png" alt="Pavlov’s experiment with dogs"></p></figure><p>In this way, a dog can be taught to associate a certain event (positive or negative) with another stimulus. This model explains why some dogs can recognize the word “walk” and will grab their leash or get excited if someone says the word.</p><h3>Operant Conditioning</h3><p>Operant conditioning is based more on voluntary behavior. And It’s done by <strong>reinforcement</strong> or <strong>punishment</strong>. This theory was first elaborated by B.F. Skinner, who conducted experiments using rats and pigeons to assess learning based on stimuli. In this model, punishment doesn’t mean abuse or even physical force; it could simply be the removal of something positive, such as attention if a dog engages in bad behavior. Operant conditioning has four quadrants and they are:<br></p><p>1. Positive-reinforcement: This is when you reward your dog for performing a behavior that you would like your dog to repeat.<br></p><p>2. Negative-reinforcement: This is when pressure is applied, and it is only turned off when your dog complies.<br></p><p>3. Positive-punishment: This is when you use a physical correction (such as popping on the leash) to reduce the occurrence of a behavior.<br></p><p>4. Negative-punishment: This is when you withhold a reward from your dog. For example, your dog wants a treat, so you tell him to sit, he decides not to sit, so he doesn't receive the reward.<br></p><h3>Social Learning</h3><p>Social learning is whereby an animal learns by copying or mimicking the behavior of others. This can be a powerful tool to use when training a dog, especially if you have access to a very well-behaved dog that can act as a model.</p><h2>How does this apply to your brain?<br></h2><p>The problem you have with Brain that I’ve mentioned earlier is a combination of two sub-problems. (1) Obedience: how to get Brain to listen to you and do what you ask. (2) Focus: once you get Brain’s attention, and he starts doing what you have asked, how to make sure he won’t quit after <a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/">8 seconds</a> or whenever a random thing tries to get his attention.</p><h3>Obedience</h3><p>If you want to sit to do some work, Brain won’t naturally sit quietly and let you do it. Brain wants to check social media, watch Youtube videos, and keep refreshing your email inbox in case you get a new email so he can rip it up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You could try to talk some sense to him and convince him to let you work, but good luck with that. Instead, as Pavlov’s experiment suggests, you could train Brain by combining a <strong>natural stimulus</strong> with an <strong>unconditioned stimulus, </strong>and associate it to an <strong>unconditioned response</strong>.<br></p><p>For example, Brain loves coffee, when you offer him coffee (unconditioned stimulus), Brain gets excited (unconditioned response). Let’s say you want Brain to get excited when you sit down to write your morning pages or your daily todo list (which usually he doesn't like doing). In this case, the natural stimulus could be something like sitting down on your desk and saying: “Hey Brain, let’s sit down for 20 minutes and do XYZ”. You would say that while sipping your brewed delicious coffee to create the connection between enjoying coffee and getting something done.<br></p><p>To compare this to Pavlov’s experiment, saying “Hey Brain, let’s do XYZ” is like ringing the bell, the coffee is the treat, and the excitement that follows is the desired response. Eventually, If you repeat this enough times, “Let’s do XYZ” will become the <em>conditioned stimulus</em> and you will get the same excitement as the <em>conditioned response</em> even without having the coffee treat!<br></p><p>Of course, things may not go as smoothly as you hope. Making Brain give you the chance to be productive is just the first step and that doesn’t mean you will actually get the work done. To make sure that happens, we need to use the other training method to deal with the focus problem.<br></p><h3>Focus</h3><p>By now, you have Brain listening to what you say and let you start working on that important task you have to finish. However, Brain’s attention span is as short as 8 seconds as some studies suggest. How do you keep Brain engaged? Since you know Brain very well, you know how much he loves chocolate and to play PUBG on the phone. So you decided to take advantage of that, by using the four quadrants of <strong>Operant Conditioning</strong>, to maximize the possibility of getting Brain to perform with reliable obedience.<br></p><p>To use <strong>positive reinforcement </strong>you could tell Brain something like: “If we work on this task for 25 minutes without interruption you can have a piece of chocolate”. You want to reinforce the good behavior of focus by rewarding it with chocolate.<br></p><p>Don’t confuse this with <strong>negative reinforcement</strong>. If Brain wants to play PUBG, and you say: “you can play PUBG but we have to finish today’s blog post first”. Here you are turning pressure on, and when Brains complies your turn it off.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two very important things to remember when using negative reinforcement: (1) once the pressure is turned on, it can’t be turned off until Brain complies. If you told Brain that he can play after you finish the blog post, but you don’t finish it and you let him play, it defeats the entire purpose. (2) Once Brain complies, the pressure must immediately be turned off. If you finished your blog post don’t ask Brain for more work, doing so will make this method less effective later on.<br></p><p>For <strong>positive punishment, </strong>you may need the help of other people. For example,<strong> </strong>if you notice that Brain is spending a lot of time playing video games, you could ask your friend or partner to help you “punish” Brain, and force you to do more cleaning duties like doing the dishes. And if they catch you playing, you have to do 50 jumping jacks. The point is that an unpleasant consequence is introduced to the subject to discourage this behavior.<br></p><p>If after all of that Brain still didn’t comply, you can delete the game from your phone, or ask a friend to change your account password. That would be an example of <strong>negative punishment</strong>, you are taking something of value away.<br>Finally, to strengthen all the new behaviors you could use <em>Social Learning</em>. Take Brain and hang out with other people who have trained “Brains”. Either it’s a local group of friends or an online community. Interacting with other well-behaving “Brains” will help your Brain to do less of the bad behaviors and more of the good ones.</p><h2>🧠 = 🐶 ?</h2><p>We want to believe so bad that we are rational beings, but that simply is not true. The same way a dog’s decisions are driven by impulse, most of your decisions are too as well. If you want to control your actions you need to control the impulses behind them. And the same way you can train a dog to do progressively more complex behaviors and tasks, so too can you train your brain to take on more and more disciplined activities.<br></p><p>Hopefully, by using the brain-dog analogy, you can see that there is progress to be made and it will take time and patience. As you don’t expect your dog to know how to spin or wave on day one, you shouldn’t expect your brain to be super focused and productive without training. So don’t forget to be nice to yourself and your inner-dog.<br></p></div></div>]]>

July 29, 2020 | https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-3-landing-page/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-3-landing-page/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So far, we've been making great progress. We've <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-1-introduction-and-user-authentication/">authenticated our users</a> and <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-2-billing/">set up our billing logic</a>. Now, let's move on to making a beatiful and blazing fast landing page, like the one I made for <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Xb5dJ47/landing.png" alt="FavoritesAPI Landing"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>There are a ton of templates and software to create landing pages with limited effort. The most important things (in my opinion) are that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>use minimal Javascript</li>
<li>rely on a CDN</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>It's generally our tendency as web developers to grab Javascript whenever we see a frontend problem, but that has heavy ramifications for site performance. Especially with important marketing material, it's vital that we ship a blazing fast site.</p>
<p>For instance, my landing page for <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a> will load from anywhere from 200 ms to 750 ms depending on whether it's been cached by the CDN. A large part of the reason that it's so fast is because it uses very little Javascript. In fact, the only Javascript on the page is the Stripe client package from the <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-2-billing/">previous billing tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, you need to rely on a CDN to ship your landing page site. CDNs (or content delivery networks) allow you to easily host your content around the world. Without a CDN in place, your users would need to go all the way to your server in order to fetch your content. With a CDN, they will hit a server that has cached your content much closer to where they live.</p>
<p>There are numberless CDNs to work with. Personally, I recommend <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for its ease of deployment, but you can use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> or <a href="https://bunnycdn.com/">BunnyCDN</a> if you want to host your own content.</p>
<p>Now that we've covered how we want our landing page to perform, let's talk about what we want it to contain.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>Our #1 goal when constructing a landing page should be to properly inform our potential customers about the benefits of our service. They should quickly get the answers they are looking for, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>What benefits your service will provide</li>
<li>What sacrifices they will need to make (cost, time, attention, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of having their questions answered, they should also have an action to take. This could be signing up for a waitlist, giving you their email, or paying for your product.</p>
<p>When building <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a>, I wanted the user to easily be able to scan my landing page to get the necessary information. The first thing they'll notice is the tag line, which is meant to give them a memorable hook into the product's purpose. Next, they'll want to know more specifically how that benefit is being provided. If you take a look at the landing page, you'll notice that your eye is drawn first to the tag line, and next to any of the bolded text. All of this bolded text is helpful information - how much the API costs, how much you will save, or how to consume the API. The unbolded text can be thought of as filler. If the user is willing to spend more time, they can peruse it, but it shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>The user should know your benefits and sacrifices in the first 10 seconds on the page</strong></p>
<p>If they have to dig deep to figure those out, there's little chance they will go further.</p>
<h3 id="deploymentandhosting">Deployment and Hosting</h3>
<p>This is probably a good time to talk about how your frontend landing page should be hosted, as opposed to your backend application. I prefer to keep the two separate with completely distinct Github repos and deployment pipelines. All of my backend code is hosted at api.favoritesapi.com or app.favoritesapi.com, while the landing page is on the base domain. This may seem like an unnecessary complication, but your marketing material has completely different needs than your backend code. Your landing page needs to be incredibly performant and rely on a first-class CDN. On the other hand, your backend code needs to be easy to deploy first and foremost. Keeping the two separate will also make it easier to make future changes to the landing page.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to deploy simple static sites. It is incredibly easy to integrate with Github, and I've found their CDN to be great. Deploying is as easy as <code>git push</code>. If you decide to go with Netlify (or a similar service), you will also need to configure your domain registrar to point to their DNS servers in order to use a custom domain.</p>
<p>Other alternatives include <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge.sh</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, or just hosting your site yourself on a VPS. If you decide to go that route, make sure to use another CDN service like Cloudflare.</p>
<p>This has been a cursory overview of how I construct my landing pages. Next time we'll be tying together billing and authentication with an email layer. Thanks for reading!</p>

Your host is Tobias Macey, and today I'm interviewing Kyle Kingsbury about his work on the Jepson testing framework and the failure modes of distributed systems. So Kyle, can you start by introducing yourself?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:24">0:02:24</a></span></p><p>Oh, my name is Kyle Kingsbury. I work on Jepsen, which is a project to test distributed systems.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:29">0:02:29</a></span></p><p>And do you remember how you first got involved in the area of data management</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:32">0:02:32</a></span></p><p>out of college? I couldn't get into grad school actually happened during the financial crash in 2009. And I was working up a startup in San Francisco and doing distributed database work</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:42">0:02:42</a></span></p><p>there one thing led to another and so can you dig a bit more into what the Jepsen project is and some of the backstory of how you came to create it and your original inspiration or motivation for digging into this particular area?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:56">0:02:56</a></span></p><p>Yeah, so Jepson is a project to helped make distributed systems safer by testing them and seeing what they do under real world failure modes. And back around 2010, its distributed systems were becoming popular industry. But a lot of folks had sort of optimistic expectations. But what was possible, and there were some claims flying around that seemed a little bit irresponsible. There was a good deal of argument over this back and forth on Twitter and blogs, mailing lists. I was active on the React mailing list for quite some time. And eventually, I started Jepson to demonstrate that these problems were actually things that could happen in the real world. They were just theoretical issues.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:03:39">0:03:39</a></span></p><p>Yeah, I know that particularly when you are just testing and building a system. It's easy to see Oh, everything works great. And kind of push off the fact that there are going to be network faults and there are going to be clock skews and clock drifts that causes things to not operate the way that you want them to. And I'm curious what you have seen As far as some of the common misconceptions or misunderstandings of people who are both building and using distributed systems and the types of guarantees that they provide,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:10">0:04:10</a></span></p><p>yeah, that couldn't be started. There were all sorts of interesting expectations. I remember MongoDB, for example, wrote something about how users shouldn't expect to preserve data when a process crashes or is killed with kill dash nine. And as a result, I think, sort of throwing some sort of cocktail party called kill dash nine. Meanwhile, React was busy falling over anytime you tried to list keys in the database. So there was there's a lot of rough and tumble action in those days. Nowadays. I think people take partitions crashes, that sort of thing more seriously. I see a lot of folks at least tried to do some degree of testing for those. And yet, when I do consulting work, often I'll find databases where it looks like nobody tried to verify behavior during faults.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:56">0:04:56</a></span></p><p>And aside from Jepson, what are some of the other matters methods that people typically use for stress testing or evaluating the guarantees of these systems</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:05:06">0:05:06</a></span></p><p>and look at Jepsen, because it's an experimental approach as being one part of a complete breakfast continuum of quality methods. One of those is to start with a proven algorithm, some sort of abstract model of your system and either to have a hand or machine check proof of it, or at least a model checker, maybe with TLA. And if you are lucky, you can do some sort of code extraction with caulk or high level or cipher f HL with Isabel. But that's, that's not I think how most production systems get built. Most systems get built by pointing at a whiteboard and writing a bunch of code. And then your tools for Safety Analysis tend to be more along the lines of unit tests and integration tests. Jepsen takes a blackbox approach, which puts it sort of at the far end of integration testing other systems like Cassandra's D test suite Take a similar approach. You'll see people who do sort of manual testing where they do fault injection via somebody just running commands on the cluster or toggling some sort of hardware power switch, or network switch. That's the approach that's taken by foundation DB foundation. Devi also does a lot of automated simulation testing, where they will run a virtualized network with many simulated nodes in the same process and they can intercept messages and reorder them to get interesting results. So I think there's there's a lot of approaches people take to testing systems Jepson tries to general and who to work across many types of systems, which often means that it's not as deep or as capable as exploring the state space as a say a simulation test that's written specifically for the database that you're working on might be,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:06:46">0:06:46</a></span></p><p>and then as far as some of the real world usage of things like databases and other mission critical distributed systems, what are some of the real world impacts that can occur as a result of these failures that aren't properly vetted or properly guarded against,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:05">0:07:05</a></span></p><p>oh, you can get all kinds of faults, obviously, data could be lost. So you, you write something and then it just disappears later, you can have different nodes that compete on some version of the history. So maybe one person thinks that the list you're adding things to is 123, and other things, it's four or five, six, you can have temporal anomalies where you read some information from the past, instead of the present. You could have transactional violations where two transactions kind of land on top of each other or interleave, in some weird way. And all these systems that I've tested exhibit,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:40">0:07:40</a></span></p><p>typically one or more of these behaviors. The question is sort of how hard you have to push them to get there. And then in terms of the actual testing approach of using Jepsen for being able to find some of these error modes that exist in a particular system. What is your overall approach for business? Finding the test suite and customizing it for a given system. Because all of these different platforms will have different guarantees that they're trying to provide, or different approaches to linearize ability or serializability, or the strictness of the isolation that they provide. And I know that that provides a fairly extensive surface area to try and cover in any test suite. And I'm wondering just what your approaches for determining what are the key points to interact with. And then also any variability in the actual interfaces that are exposed by these systems for being able to interact with them and validate the correctness of the operations that are being performed?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:08:38">0:08:38</a></span></p><p>Yeah, you're quite right. There's there's sort of two huge surface areas to cover. One of them is the breadth of the API, all the different things databases do. Modern SQL databases have so many functions and so many interacting components that it's really difficult to predict, you know, how they're going to interact. And it also is tricky because when you get awkward misers into the mix. You know, depending on something like the size of your data, you might have two very different code paths that can evolve with different safety properties. So I don't have a good answer for that, you know, I write as many tests as I can in the time that I have. But that's usually just a tiny fraction of the overall API. My guiding principle is to …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure layer. As a result, developers can focus on building applications, then deploy them to any of those environments.</p>



<p>To bring Kubernetes closer to developers, we’ve created a ready-to-use <a href="https://github.com/microtica-components/component-aws-eks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infrastructure component for Kubernetes</a>. This component uses AWS EKS as a service and sets Kubernetes master and nodes in auto-scaling infrastructure setup. Nodes are EC2 instances based on Kubernetes optimized AMIs.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Components are a core concept in Microtica which allow developers to create and release their custom Cloud infrastructure setup in a standardized way. A</em>fter <em>the component is created, it can be reused in as many projects and environments as needed.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">infrastructure setup</a> for Kubernetes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microtica.com/" target="_blank">Microtica</a> also offers you CI and CD for microservices. This means that you don’t have to worry about the complex details of the integration with Kubernetes. With this, we cover the whole process of software and infrastructure delivery.</p>



<p>In this article, we will learn how to <strong>deploy a microservice in the cloud with our Kubernetes component</strong>. Let’s get started by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/register" target="_blank">creating your account</a> and project in Microtica. To deploy your first microservice in under 10 mins, follow these steps:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Add your AWS Account</strong></h3>



<p>First, go into <em>Settings</em>, then <em>AWS Accounts </em>tab, then <em>Add New Account</em>. Follow the steps to connect your account.</p>



<p><em>Note: All resources will be created on the provided AWS account, expenses will be calculated according to AWS pricing for using the services.</em></p>



<h3><strong>2. Create an environment</strong></h3>



<p>With a connected AWS account, you can continue to create your environment in which you’ll deploy your infrastructure. <a href="https://portal.microtica.com/environments/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Create an environment</a> following the wizard on Microtica and then continue to add the components we will need.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Add components</strong></h3>



<p>To successfully setup a working Kubernetes Cluster in which we’ll deploy a microservice, we will need only 2 components: a <strong>VPC component </strong>and of course a <strong>Kubernetes Cluster component</strong>. We need the VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) component to enable us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we’ve defined. This virtual network is dedicated to your AWS account. This component sets one AWS VPC, and four subnets (2 public and 2 private subnets).</p>



<p>Here’s how to configure your components to connect them and create the infrastructure.</p>

<p><em>Note: You will need to create an EC2 key-pair from the AWS console. We don’t create it automatically due to security reasons. This key should always be in your possession and kept in a secure place. This key will allow you to access your EC2 instances through SSH.</em></p>

<p>When configuring the parameters for the Kubernetes Cluster component you can reference the VPC component so you <strong>don’t have to manually reenter the values</strong>. Microtica will take care of the order in which the components will be deployed in the cloud. This will allow you to have a working environment.</p>

<p>With the configuration set in place, you can deploy your environment by clicking <em>Create Plan</em>. Here you will see a detailed listing of the resources that are about to be added to the environment. Confirming will initiate the deployment and lead you to a page where you can follow the logs and events that are happening. Setting up this infrastructure can take up to 15 mins, so let us get started with our microservice in the meantime.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Create a microservice</strong></h3>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we will be using a simple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World microservice</a> available in Docker hub. First, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/microservices/create" target="_blank"><em>Microservices/Create microservice</em></a><em> </em>and follow the wizard in Microtica. For a source select public docker image and paste <strong>hello-world</strong>. Then, click <em>Next</em>, then <em>Create Microservice </em>and now we have our microservice.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png" alt="Creating a Kubernetes microservice

<p>As a result of using a docker image as a source, we already have a built artifact so we can immediately deploy it in the Kubernetes cluster. <strong>You can do this from <em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em> Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Microtica offers configuration options when deploying your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can select the scaling options, and as well setup continuous delivery for your microservice.</p>



<p>After successfully deploying the microservice in the Kubernetes Cluster you can preview your microservice by following the <strong><em>Access URL/hello-world-ms</em></strong><em> </em>(the name of the service if you’ve changed it). You should see this in your browser window:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0KLYx9DQIHY9wBiN8.png" alt="Your first microservice on a Kubernetes cluster
"></figure></div>



<p><strong>AND WE ARE DONE! WE JUST DEPLOYED OUR FIRST MICROSERVICE ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER 👏</strong></p>



<h3><strong>5. Bonus: Cleanup</strong></h3>



<p>To remove all the resources we created on your AWS account go to environment details and in the menu select <em>Undeploy. </em>As a result, you’ll get your resources created on AWS cleaned. However, you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.</p>

The methods of the <code>DB</code> interface in the example below differ from their counterparts from the <em>go-redis</em> library in the return type: they return plain Go <code>error</code> instead of <em>go-redis</em>-specific types and the reson for this is to minimize the code coupling to the 3rd party library.</p><p>A books library that allows storing and loading authors and books using a Redis database.</p><h2 id="boilerplate">Boilerplate</h2><p>Create a folder named <code>injectable-method-definitions</code>, <code>cd</code> into it and initialize it as a Go module by running <code>go mod init injectable-method-definitions</code>.</p><p>Then create the following tree of folders and files:</p><pre><code>internal

July 29, 2020 | https://dataform.co/blog/the-startup-data-stack-starter-pack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dataform.co/blog/the-startup-data-stack-starter-pack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Data collection, integration, warehousing, modelling and visualization. What are the options, best of breed products and how much do they all cost.</p><div><div><p>I advise a lot of people on how to build out their data stack, from tiny startups to enterprise companies that are moving to the cloud or from legacy solutions. There are many choices out there, and navigating them all can be tricky. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of your options, trade offs, pricing and some thinking points around which you can make your decision, as well as some personal thoughts on the options.</p>
<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m CTO and co-founder at Dataform, I was previously an engineer at Google, where I spent most of my 6 years there building big data pipelines with internal tools similar to what is now Apache Beam. Dataform is a data modelling platform for cloud data warehouses, and while only one small part of the overall data stack, is often the glue that ties many things together and as a result, we spend a lot of time talking about overall data architecture with customers and prospective clients.</p>
<h2 id="product-recommendation-methodology">Product recommendation methodology</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s impossible for me to give a completely fair trial to every product in this space. In general, Iâ€™ve chosen to highlight products that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have generally high adoption and awareness amongst startups</li>
<li>We generally hear our customers speak highly of</li>
<li>Fit into the ELT model of a data stack</li>
<li>Innovative new products that may not tick the above boxes, I personally believe are worth a mention</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I have significant experience with a product, Iâ€™ll let you know and provide more detail on why. Similarly in one or two cases Iâ€™ve shared my reasons for not recommending them.</p>

<p>There is a prevailing model of a data stack that we consistently see the world moving toward, thatâ€™s probably best summed up by this diagram. This is an ELT architecture (extract, load, transform) as opposed to a more traditional ETL architecture, and can support companies of all sizes (perhaps with the exception of extremely large enterprises).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.dataform.co/blog/startup-data-stack-starter-pack/etl-vs-elt-elt-architecture.webp" alt="ELT Architecture"></p>
<h2 id="event-data-collection">Event data collection</h2>
<p>How do you collect event data from across all of your different applications, web, app, backend services and send them to other systems or your data warehouse.</p>
<p>Conceptually straightforward, so not much to say here! Event based analytics is usually the easiest place to start and most off the shelf solutions are built around this.</p>
<p>Tracking everything that you want to use for analytics in events avoids needing to join in other data sources at analysis time and lends itself well to product analytics where ordering of events is important to consider.</p>
<h2 id="data-integration">Data integration</h2>
<p>How do you move data between databases and services? There is some overlap with collection here. Typically you need to move data between various places such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>SaaS services &gt; Data warehouse</li>
<li>Production DBs &gt; Data warehouse</li>
<li>Event collection &gt; Data warehouse / SaaS tools / CRMs</li>
<li>Data warehouse &gt; SaaS tools / CRMs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of the article weâ€™ll consider these as two different data integration problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data integration to the warehouse</li>
<li>Data integration to other SaaS products</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-warehouses">Data warehouses</h2>
<p>Where you move all your data to so you can query it together.</p>
<p>A lot about data warehousing has changed over the last 10 years, data warehouses now scale to unprecedented levels. Before Snowflake and BigQuery, organizations with truly massive data would have avoided them due to limited scale, and instead opt for solutions such as Apache Spark, Dataflow, or Hadoop MapReduce like systems.</p>
<p>Warehouses and SQL have many benefits and the scalability limits are (mostly) gone. Additionally with the rise of engineering inspired data modelling tools (such as Dataform), itâ€™s possible to manipulate data via SQL in a well tested, reproducible way.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve <a href="https://dataform.co/blog/consider-sql-when-writing-your-next-processing-pipeline">written about this change</a> if youâ€™d like more information on why we think the shift towards SQL based warehousing is the right one and how it can help you move quickly, especially as a startup!</p>
<h2 id="data-modelling">Data modelling</h2>
<p>How do you actually transform data from many different sources into a set of clean, well tested data sets? </p>
<p>ELT introduces a new problem, you end up with a data warehouse full of messy datasets from your newly set up data integration tools and no idea how to use them. This is where data modelling comes in, and if you are building a stack with a data warehouse at the center, it needs to be addressed.</p>
<h2 id="data-visualization--analytics">Data visualization &amp; analytics</h2>
<p>Once you sort out all of the above, how do you actually use that data to answer business questions or do advanced analytics?</p>
<p>For any company, and particularly startups understanding how your users use your products, how much time they spend on your app, what your signup and activation rates are like is obviously important.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll mostly cover the business intelligence and product analytics side of this, and avoid more advanced ML and data science applications as this usually comes afterward.</p>

<p>Once you hit a certain level of complexity, or need complete control over how you join and mutate data before sending it to other systems you probably want to move to a model where the data warehouse becomes your source of truth for business data. This gives you the most power as once all your data is there, you can do pretty much anything with it.</p>
<p>For very early stage startups, <strong>I recommend that you avoid this initially</strong>. Off the shelf product analytics tools will provide you with the insights you need without the extra work during the early stages.</p>
<p>In this model, you typically require just two components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection (events)</li>
<li>Visualization / analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>A concrete example of this would be something like:</p>
<p><strong>Segment &gt; Mixpanel / Amplitude / Heap / Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Using a product like <a href="#segment">Segment</a> gives you the flexibility to move that data to your warehouse in the future, if not immediately.</p>
<p>As this is probably something youâ€™ll need to do at some point, Iâ€™d recommend using something that can do this from day one, as moving from something all in one such as Google Analytics to something custom built around a warehouse can be difficult or expensive (Google will charge you a lot of money to move your raw GA data into BigQuery).</p>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>Data collection products allow you to track events from various apps, and capture user activity, pageviews, clicks, sessions etc. This is not about collecting data from e.g. your production DB (see data integration).</p>
<h3 id="segment"><a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a></h3>
<p><em>The market leader, with some good out the box data integration solutions.</em></p>
<p>Segment is great, and we use it ourselves. Segment is more than just data collection. Their somewhat open-source analytics.js provides unified APIs for tracking events in pretty much any system.</p>
<p>Events from Segment can be sent to your warehouse, but can also be sent straight to other systems, for example Google/Twitter/Facebook/Quora Ads, most major CRMs.</p>
<p>Segment can get really expensive really quickly, particularly for B2C companies with high numbers of monthly tracked users. However as their core APIs are open-source, itâ€™s possible to migrate to your own infrastructure. </p>
<p>Definitely worth mentioning <a href="https://rudderstack.com/">RudderStack</a> here, an open source host it yourself alternative to Segment that uses the same open-source APIs. When your Segment costs start to exceed an engineering salary, this is probably the time to consider such alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="snowplow"><a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">Snowplow</a></h3>
<p><em>Event data collection done right, and itâ€™s open-source.</em></p>
<p>Snowplow excels at event data collection, period. It lacks the out of the box data integration solutions of Segment, but arguably has a much more rich feature set when it comes to actual event tracking, such as validation of event schemas.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s open-source, so you can run and manage it yourself if you want to.</p>
<p>Snowplow wonâ€™t help you push data to your CRM or other SaaS products, but there are other options here we discuss below.</p>
<h3 id="all-in-one-solutions">All in one solutions</h3>
<p>Segment and Snowplow are primarily designed for data collection. There are other tools that will help you collect data too, but they are part of what Iâ€™ll call â€œall in oneâ€� data analytics packages. I wonâ€™t cover these here, but have mentioned them below as part of <a href="#data-visualization-and-analytics">Data visualization and analytics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-integration-to-the-warehouse">Data integration to the warehouse</h2>
<p>Data integration products allow you to move data from one source to another. This section covers products that help you move data to your warehouse. </p>
<p>Some of these products also act as data transformation tools (traditional ETL). We donâ€™t recommend this approach, preferring a more software engineering (SQL / code based) approach that will scale as you grow out your data team (see <a href="#data-modelling">data modelling</a>).
As a result, our recommendations are for data integration products that are designed with an ELT model in mind.</p>
<p>These products move data from other data sources such as CRMs, Stripe, most popular databases (Mongo, MySQL, Postgres etc) into your warehouse, so you have everything in one place and can join it all together and perform advanced analytics queries on the results.</p>
<h3 id="stitch"><a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">Stitch</a></h3>
<p><em>The best option for early startups, teams who want to write their own integrations, or value open-source.</em></p>
<p>Recently acquired by Talend, of which Iâ€™ve seen little impact so far - for better or worse. We use them ourselves, and they serve the majority of our integration needs very well.</p>
<p>Simple self service onboarding, reasonable usage based pricing. Open-source core, you can write your own singer taps, and run it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="fivetran"><a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a></h3>
<p><em>The best option for those who are willing to pay a little more, or with certain data sources.</em></p>
<p>Historically a more enterprise sales model, recently changed to variable/volume based pricing, and will build adapters for you if you pay them, but moving toward a self-service model. My understanding is Fivetran still nets out as a bit more expensive than Stitch, but they certainly build extremely high quality integrations.</p>
<p>Fivetran makes considerable efforts to normalize data coming from source systems into a more friendly format, whereas Stitch integrations are arguably a bit less intelligent.</p>

<p>Accurate data visualisation is the key to understanding your data well enough to be able to draw valuable business conclusions, based on which you can make truly informed, strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Entire books have been written about how to visualise data properly, what to pay special attention to, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to draw the greatest value from your data.</p>
<p>Our goal in writing this article is to provide you with concrete business use cases, based on our practical knowledge and project experience. In the sections below, you’ll be able to learn more about our customer success stories and the tips we’ve gathered to help you succeed with your data visualisation efforts.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll be able to employ some of our 5 data visualisation best practices to grow your business and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started!</p>
<h3>1. Your data should always present the context and the audience</h3>
<p><strong>Client Scenario:</strong> “We conducted a marketing campaign and want to check if we succeeded”.</p>
<p>Our client approached us as they wanted to check how effective their marketing campaign efforts were. During initial discussions, it turned out (as it usually does) that the client had a different concept in mind than we did regarding how such a data visualisation dashboard should look like.</p>
<p>The client asked us to generate a list of customers that come back to them as a result of the campaign. In response to this request, we asked them whether they were sure that customers would not have come back themselves but did so only as a result of their campaign. We also wanted to know whether the client was interested in finding out which specific group of customers was the most engaged with the campaign and which target audience wasn’t necessarily interested. And so on…</p>
<p>After the discussion, it turned out that we need to take into account customer movement over time and to prepare two different types of analyses – one dashboard with quick insights that may be shared with the Management team and a second, more in-depth dashboard for the Marketing Manager.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Get to know your audience and their needs – this is always a worthwhile, value-adding effort.</p>
<h3>2. Declutter, declutter, and… declutter!</h3>
<p><strong>Client Scenario:</strong> “We want to transfer our reporting system from one tool to another”.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the client’s request and analysing their existing system, it turned out that the best solution would be to simply declutter the reporting charts.</p>
<p>To do so, we removed gridlines, got rid of 3D effects, omitted the y-axis (points had labels), transposed the graph, put the labels inside the bars, and finally sorted the results.</p>
<p>Here’s a before and after comparison:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/d1yl4s44/data_5tips_01-1.png" data-udi="umb://media/4bbff0188bde4efaa3945a87f77d4690" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/d1yl4s44/data_5tips_01-1.png"></p>
<p>To learn more about decluttering, watch this <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X79o46W5plI" target="_blank" data-anchor="?v=X79o46W5plI">video</a> by Cole Nussbaumer Knafilc.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> The more unnecessary visual elements you get rid of, the more profound of an impact you will make.</p>
<h3>3. Use colours wisely</h3>
<p>In another one of our client’s projects, we were tasked with preparing a dashboard which included certain clearly negative connotations (e.g. deaths, breakdowns, waste). When discussing the colour palette with the client, we noticed that they were using green to signify certain data points. Using green is completely fine, however, it’s worth noting that the use of a certain colour should support your story and not distract your reader's attention or send a contradictory message.</p>
<p>When considering the colour palette of your dashboards, there are two key things to take into account. Firstly, colours have the power to affect emotions and, secondly, certain topics are often already naturally associated with specific colours (e.g. the colour green is often used to signalise that something is finished, positive in nature, or increasing). Hence, when coming up with a colour scheme for your data solutions, it’s worth reflecting on these aspects.</p>
<p>Another colour palette tip worth sharing concerns accessibility – some end users could be colour blind, so it’s important to take their needs into consideration.</p>
<p>For additional insights on this topic, check out the “DataViz Debate” by Andy Cotgreave and Andy Kirk – the recording is available <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/webinars/data-viz-debate-blue-orange">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> “Colours are the visual property that people most often misuse in visualisation without being aware of it.” – Robert Kosara, Senior Research Scientist at Tableau Software.</p>
<h3>4. Less is more</h3>
<p>One of our clients asked us to prepare the data source for one of their departments. Before jumping into the project, we analysed their request and asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you need so much data?</li>
<li>Would you be able to get any insight out of this quickly?</li>
<li>Are you not getting lost in this data?</li>
</ul>
<p>The conclusion was as follows: the client had two data sources and needed to compare the data between them. The first dataset was ready, but we would need to prepare the second one (there was a group of people doing the comparison manually). That’s the entire story in a nutshell.</p>
<p>In such a situation, why not to do the whole comparison automatically then measure and visualise the differences and not the whole dataset? This approach may seem to suggest that the client would be getting less (as they wouldn’t be getting the whole dataset), but I believe that they would actually be able to gain more, by getting the most fit-for-purpose solution.</p>
<p>Before/After:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/dfsmfvqy/data_5tips_01.png" data-udi="umb://media/d6c2641f5618464cacbf42b2ee544f31" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/dfsmfvqy/data_5tips_01.png"></p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> It’s always a good idea to ask why.</p>
<h3>5. Choose the most informative way to visualise data</h3>
<p>We were asked to prepare a dashboard on the progress of projects by another one of our clients. We received a list of measures that should be displayed. At the beginning, it seemed to them that they need several line charts with the possibility to filter by project. But then, during the discussion, we agreed that it would be too cumbersome to draw any conclusions on the portfolio level from such visualisations.</p>
<p>We decided to introduce relationship charts and rankings to enable the end user to draw conclusions and move from the more general information to the more detailed data.</p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/qfeo0gm3/data_5tips_03.png" data-udi="umb://media/19ed4887da9d461091472cf73e55d6cb" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/qfeo0gm3/data_5tips_03.png"></p>
<p>There are many articles and blog posts on what and how to choose in terms of data visualisation (e.g. <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.datapine.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-data-visualization-types/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.sqlbi.com/ref/power-bi-visuals-reference/">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> One wisely selected chart can replace a huge table, while enabling users to draw conclusions more quickly.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When preparing data visualisations and analyses, you must be careful because you can quite easily destroy all the information that should be understood by the end user. Fortunately, however, there are many methods, tips, and best practices that can help you avoid this failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>To optimise the meeting of requirements and the drawing of conclusions, it’s important to keep the context and the audience in mind.</li>
<li>By decluttering visualisations, you provide the end user with the opportunity to draw more accurate conclusions.</li>
<li>Consider the colour scheme carefully as it should support the story you have in your dashboard.</li>
<li>Provide only as much information on your data visualisation as the client needs, in the most legible and informative manner.</li>
<li>Try to achieve results that will prove the most useful and advantageous for the business by choosing the most appropriate visualisations.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you try to learn new things constantly. You read books, watch educational Youtube clips, read interesting blogs, and listen to podcasts. </p>



<p>You might have a system for collecting what you learn from many of these sources. Perhaps you highlight your Kindle books, sketch in your physical books, or you copy/paste blog post takeaways into Roam, Notion or some other Personal Knowledge Management system. But taking notes from podcasts has always been a hassle. Do you stop in the middle of your walk to jot down a note? Do you take a screenshot with an intention to return to this part of the podcast later (which never happens)? Do you try to force your brain to remember it until you’re back at your computer?</p>



<p><strong>I have struggled with this for years, and I’ve finally found an elegant solution to the problem in a wonderful new podcast iOS app called <a href="http://airr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airr</a>. </strong></p>



<p>Airr may look like any regular podcast player out there, but it has one killer feature that sets it apart from all the others: <strong>it lets you collect snippets of any ongoing podcast, with a single tap, <em>as you are listening</em>! </strong>These snippets are called “AirrQuotes”, and you can think of them as book highlights for the podcast format. </p>



<p>This is how it works: let’s say you are walking around and listening to <a href="http://perell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Perell</a>‘s North Star podcast, for example <a href="https://www.airr.io/episode/5f037b9bc7fd2b4d918d6d54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the episode where David interviews Partick McKenzie, the co-founder of Stripe</a>. Almost nine minutes in, Patrick says something very smart about why you should start writing online despite having zero people following you, because it can lead to great things down the line. You want to save this for later, for example because you want to use it in a blog post (like this one!). In that case you simply ask Siri to <em>“Take an AirrQuote”</em>, which trigges Airr to save the last 45 seconds you just heard in the podcast episode. </p>



<p><strong>This AirrQuote is then saved in the Airr app, and you can return back to it later, for example when you are in front of your computer and you’re ready to add your AirrQuotes to Roam or your note-taking system of choice. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s say you listen to the entire podcast episode, and you take AirrQuotes this whenever David or Patrick drops some wisdom bombs into your ears, like I did. After the episode is over, I have 5 AirrQuotes that I want to remember or refer back to. </p>



<p>When I’m at my computer, I simply open the Airr app on my phone, select all the AirrQuotes from the episode, and click Share. I can copy links to all the AirrQuotes, and paste the link directly into my Macbook, and it comes out like this:</p>



<ul><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f0732bdd1e72c0d0c903daf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f0732bdd1e72c0d0c903daf</a></li><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f07372dd1e72c2cce903dc3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f07372dd1e72c2cce903dc3</a></li><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f073e17d1e72c5cfb903e9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f073e17d1e72c5cfb903e9e</a> (and so on, for as many AirrQuotes as I took during the episode).</li></ul>



<p>Those links all point directly to the parts of the podcast episode that I have highlighted (I’ve made them public so you can listen to them if you want, just click the links above). Now I can simply re-listen to each AirrQuote and type what I hear directly into my note-taking app of choice. No need to listen to the entire episode again to re-discover my key takeaways. No need to try to remember all the points as I listen the first time. It’s all right there. </p>



<h2>Export with text</h2>



<p>If that weren’t enough, Airr has another amazing feature: podcast transcription export. For many podcasts, <strong>Airr provides a transcribed text from the podcast audio, so you can simply export your AirrQuotes in text format directly into your notes.</strong> These transcriptions are computer generated, so they aren’t perfect, but they still save you 90% of the time compared to writing out each note yourself. You just have to edit them for clarity and brevity, which is a good thing because working with the text will boost your retention rate. </p>



<h2>Share AirrQuotes with friends</h2>



<p>Another fun feature in Airr is the ability to share AirrQuotes with friends. Instead of saying <em>“Hey you HAVE to listen to this podcast, it’s so great! Check out the 5, 8 and 32 minute mark!”</em>, you can simply send a quick audio clip to a friend which makes it self-explanatory why he should listen to the episode. </p>



<p>These AirrQuotes can be shared either with a link to the clip (as I showed above), or they can be turned into engaging video clips that are even more fun to share. </p>



<p>Here’s one example from a podcast episode where TOMS Shoes founder Blake Mycoskie is interviewed about his personality type, which I had to send to a close friend who shares some of Blake’s personality traits. </p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://jacobmorch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blake-Mykoskie-Typology-podcast-Enneagram-7.mp4"></video><figcaption>Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS, talking about his personality type as an Enneagram 7 (The Enthusiast)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>See what your Twitter connections have AirrQuoted</h2>



<p>Airr also integrates with Twitter, so you can see the AirrQuotes taken by the people you follow, and share your own AirrQuotes if you want. As Airr grows and gets more users, this will be more and more interesting. This could become the first podcast suggestion engine that serves me things I am actually interested in, much like a well-curated Twitter feed. </p>



<p>What do the people I admire find interesting? Which shows do they listen to? What specific takeaways do they highlight from the episodes they listen to? Their AirrQuotes will show me. </p>

<h2>Take an AirrQuote with just a tap on your AirPods (or other headphones)</h2>



<p>Airr keeps improving with every new release, and the most recent feature that blew me away was a new shortcut for capturing AirrQuotes when I’m on the move. There are three ways to take an AirrQuote in Airr:</p>



<ol><li>Open your phone, open the Airr app and click the quote symbol (high friction),</li><li>Ask Siri to “take an AirrQuote” while listening to a podcast (medium friction).</li><li>Double-tap your left AirPod when listening to a podcast in Airr (extremely low friction). </li></ol>



<p>This third method is simply brilliant. I can now easily capture AirrQuotes with a single tap on my AirPods while driving, walking around or while doing the dishes. </p>



<p>(Note: this feature also works with other headphones, in most cases with a triple click on the play/pause button. This is the command that usually leads to jumping back to the previous song in music apps, or jumping back 30 seconds in most podcast and audiobook apps). </p>



<h2>Bonus tip: Change the Siri command</h2>



<p>One thing I struggled with before the tap your Airpods feature came out, was that Siri would hear my attempts to say <em>“Take an AirrQuote”</em> as <em>“Take an airport”</em>, and be very confused. I changed the Siri command to <em>“Take a podcast quote”</em> instead, and then it worked every time. I recommend you do something similar if you want to use Siri for taking AirrQuotes.</p>



<h2>Bonus tip 2: Export AirrQuotes directly to Roam: </h2>



<p>I found this tip on twitter, posted by Sam Rukeyser, one of the founders of Airr. He has made an iOS shortcut that lets you dump your AirrQuotes directly into Roam from your phone. </p>



<p>See his process in this tweet:  </p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/mg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mg</a> to create an iOS shortcut to Copy an AirrQuote into <a href="https://twitter.com/RoamResearch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@RoamResearch</a>. Opens Quick Capture from Airr’s in-app browser, no need to switch apps. <a href="https://t.co/U3UPCLZwFL" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/U3UPCLZwFL</a></p>— Sam Rukeyser (@SamRukeyser) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamRukeyser/status/1279143460574916609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 3, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<h2>Room for improvement</h2>



<p>Airr is a fantastic app, but it’s still not perfect. Sometimes I experience a bug where the play button doesn’t work, and I’m patiently awaiting the day I can export the transcriptions from multiple AirrQuotes at once, which I guess the Airr team has on their roadmap for the future. </p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite this minor issues, the bottom line is this: <strong>Airr is hands down the best podcast players for people who want to remember what they hear, take notes from podcasts, or share interesting podcast moments with friends.</strong> </p>



<p>I look forwards to taking loads and loads of AirrQuotes going forwards. If you do too, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="let's connect on Twitter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/JMorch" target="_blank">let’s connect on Twitter</a>, so we can see each others’ quotes!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://getpocket.com/" title="Pocket">Pocket</a> for the last few years, actually moved from <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes" title="GDPR incident">GDPR incident</a>, and I’ve been happy ever since. But I decided to move all of my public links to my static website. The reason for this has nothing to do with the company, I think they offer a great service for free. It is just I never liked that another company owns my data, especially in this case when a service is easily replaceable by a simple note-taking app.</p>
<p>So how am I going to replace Pocket? Well, all my favorite links will be exported from Pocket to a <a href="https://bojanvidanovic.com/bookmarks" title="dedicated page">dedicated page</a> on my website and will be publicly available, as on the <a href="https://getpocket.com/@bojanvidanovic" title="Pocket profile">Pocket profile</a> page. Then I’ll manage all my future links through Git or <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="CMS">CMS</a>. While the read-it-later type of links will be bookmarked in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> and synced across all my devices, which I’ve been already using for a while and find it much easier to use.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-data-from-pocket">Exporting data from Pocket</h3>
<p>Requesting your data from Pocket is a one-click operation, the problem is that they don’t give you any options on what file type you want. All your data is by default exported in an HTML file with a bunch of list items.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">    &lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;

    ...
    &lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="converting-to-json">Converting to JSON</h3>
<p>So, I slightly modified the exported HTML file to use dataset attributes for tags like time_added and tags, copied it to <a href="https://codepen.io/" title="Codepen">Codepen</a> and ran this code to get the list in JSON format:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">    <span>var</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> [];
    
    <span>$</span>(<span>'ul a'</span>).<span>each</span>(<span>function</span>(<span>idx</span>, <span>item</span>){
        <span>list</span>.<span>push</span>({
            <span>href</span><span>:</span> <span>$</span>(<span>item</span>).<span>attr</span>(<span>'href'</span>),
            <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>textContent</span>,
            <span>date</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>date</span>,
            <span>tags</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>tags</span>
        });
    });
    
    <span>JSON</span>.<span>stringify</span>(<span>list</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>"  "</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="importing-to-static-website">Importing to static website</h3>
<p>After obtaining the list in JSON format, I needed to create a Markdown file for every entry in the JSON file. This is where the Python magic comes in:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>import</span> json
    
    f <span>=</span> open(<span>'export.json'</span>)
    data <span>=</span> json<span>.</span>load(f)
    
    <span>for</span> link <span>in</span> data:

        <span>with</span> open(filename <span>+</span> <span>".md"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> md_file:
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'title: "'</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"text"</span>]<span>.</span>encode(<span>'utf-8'</span>) <span>+</span> <span>'"</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'date: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"date"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'linkUrl: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"href"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>close()
    
    f<span>.</span>close()</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple script created a Markdown file for Hugo for every link from the list.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, with a few simple scripts I have back my data and transferred to my <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a> website. And replaced the core Pocket functionality with Firefox bookmarks.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>Winamp was published by Nullsoft in 1997 as the public supported multimedia player and was a pioneer as well as a disruptor in the Internet space. Lead by Justin and other developers, Winamp soon became one of the most revolutionary applications of its kind. Nullsoft, acquired by AOL in 1999, also published SHOUTcast, Gnutella and NSIS. Winamp was an early leader in community developed programs and helped to spawn the open source software movement for music. You can drop by the team &amp; alumni pages to learn more about the people responsible for creating the player, turning out new revs, maintaining the website, and fostering relations with the developer community.</p>
<p>Winamp is one of the most popular multimedia players allowing users to manage and play audio and video files. Winamp supports playback of 70 audio and video formats, and is available in two versions: Winamp Standard and Winamp Pro. To name a few, it features robust tools for creating playlists, customizing your playback experience (aka “skinning”), managing podcasts, syncing portable devices, listening to internet radio stations, and accessing remote media (Winamp Remote).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Winamp-Review.gif"><img src="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Winamp-Review.gif" alt="Winamp-Review" width="550" height="231"></a></p>
<p>The Winamp Pro version provides you with several additional features like mp3 ripping, high speed audio CD burning/ripping, extra-small file size encoding with AACPlus, and native support for H.264 encoded video. If you have not tried this multimedia player, downloading the Winamp must be your first stop.<br>
At its core Winamp is all about individuality and customization, that’s why we offer add-ons to extend functionality beyond the original design. Thanks to the efforts of the development community, Winamp offers over 10,000 add-ons including skins, plug-ins, visualizations &amp; online services.</p>
<h3>Skins:</h3>
<p>In addition to its breadth of features and support of high fidelity playback, one of Winamp’s main differentiators is its skin-able interface. This level of customization gives you the control to reflect your own individual personality. To date the Winamp community has created over 8,000 skins. Browse our gallery to find one that fits your taste, or if you are the DIY type, make your own.</p>
<h3>Plug-ins:</h3>
<p>A Plug-in extends the functionality of Winamp and allows you to add just about anything to your Winamp player including equalizers, additional codecs, language packs, games and more. There are over 3000 community developed plug-ins to choose from, so you can browse the plug-in gallery or make your own.</p>
<h3>Visualizations:</h3>
<p>You can also bring your music to life with any one of Winamp’s world renowned visualizations. Essentially they’re dynamic add-ons that produce images, colors, and textures that change based on elements of the music being played. There are nearly 2,800 presets available for download in our visualization gallery. As a side note, the creator of Milkdrop (one of the two visualization platforms in Winamp) in Ryan Geiss. Ryan who now works for Microsoft, is a core developer of the human-tracking algorithms for Xbox 360’s Kinect. Explore our Winamp visualization gallery and select the best one.</p>
<p>If it isn’t clear already, we’ll say it again… we love our user community! Be sure to support them by downloading and using their add-ons — be it a new skin, a tweaked out visualization, an online service, a plug-in, or one of the 30 different language packs. Winamp is for people who like to customize: offering the widest range of extensions, skins, plugins, and Internet services. If you like the add-on, give them some feedback by reviewing, rating, or leaving a comment.</p>

    <article id="content">
      <p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) was invented in the early 1990s and it’s still thriving. But PDFs are mainly for humans – not machines. So it’s often hard to automatically extract information out of PDFs. Besides, more and more functionalities were put into PDF. The complexity of the format makes it hard to get started. But there are existing, well-established software tools. Some have been around for decades. In this blog post, I review some existing tools with the focus on Python. Python is the default language for data processing right now.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-utilitysystem-libraries">PDF Utility/System Libraries</h2>
<p>There are some PDF libraries that power PDF Viewers but can also be used to work on PDFs from the command line.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">ghostscript</a>: PDF started with ghostscript so this is the mother of all PDF tools.</li>
<li><a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/">poppler</a>: Used for the vast majority of Linux-based PDF viewers, Libre Office, etc. ‘poppler-utils’ is a collection of tools built upon poppler, e.g. ‘pdftotext’.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mupdf.com/index.html">mutool</a>: The library is used for an alternative, lightweight PDF viewer.</li>
<li><a href="http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/">qpdf</a>: Not a fully-fledged PDF library, mainly to manipulate PDFs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/">pdftk</a> (unmaintained, <a href="https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk">here a maintained Java re-implementation</a>)</li>

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>What is the right strategy to achieve greatness and succeed in a specific domain? If you believe the predominant narrative in many efficiency-oriented societies today, the answer is clear: Focus on one thing early in life to have a head start and invest at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/21/practice-does-not-always-make-perfect-violinists-10000-hour-rule">the famous 10,000 hours of practice</a> to become a master at it. Excellence and ingenuity, the story goes, are a result of hyperspecialization, grit, and relentless focus. Except this might actually not be true.</p>

<p>In “<a href="https://davidepstein.com/the-range/">Range</a>,” David Epstein tells a different story: Neither is an early head start and narrow specialization necessary to achieve greatness, as he demonstrates with several examples from Roger Federer, who played many different sports like skiing, basketball, and soccer as a child until settling for a career in tennis, to the “figlie di coro,” the virtuoso musicians of eighteenth-century Venice, who played not only the violin but also several other instruments like the cello, oboe, lute, mandolin, harpsichord, and “viola d’amore”. Nor is hyperspecialization the primary source of creativity, innovative ideas, and scientific breakthroughs later in life. From Vincent Van Gogh to Django Reinhardt to several inventors and Nobel laureates, the book is full of gripping stories and thought-provoking research showing that mental meandering, personal experimentation, and cross-disciplinary thinking are sources of power, creativity, and true innovation.</p>

<p><em>Range</em> is a powerful reminder that there is a place for the generalists, the curios polymaths, among us. That it is okay, also for your children, to go broad and try different paths until you find what really fits you – and who you really are. That when you face a “wicked” problem, diverse experience beyond the boundaries of a specific field is a huge advantage because it allows you to think outside the box. And that having range can be invaluable in connecting seemingly unrelated disciplines and concepts in new ways.</p>

<p>Like many other domains, the web industry is becoming more and more specialized. And many of us seem to believe that only by becoming specialists ourselves, we can keep up with the increasing complexity and diversity of the Web and its countless technologies. We invent ever more specific positions and job titles, read ever more specific books, and go to ever more specific conferences. And so you have to decide: Are you a designer or a developer? Front-end or back-end? Front of the front-end or back of the front-end? CSS or JavaScript? Angular or React? And <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">the gaps between the disciplines are growing</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, many of us out there are allrounders who love to tinker, prototype, experiment, and build. Many of us are interested in the most diverse topics and feel most at home at the interfaces between design, technology, and the arts. And, as David Epstein shows, the more a domain specializes, the more it depends on generalists who see the bigger picture and make connections specialists are unable to see. Research suggests that broad individuals can even be more valuable than a diverse group of specialists. So the next time someone calls you a “Jack of all trades, master of none,” gift them a copy of <em>Range</em>.</p>

<p>Being a generalist is not a sign of weakness – it is a sign of strength. And, with <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/">job titles like Front-end Designer emerging</a>, it seems as if the industry is slowly recognizing this. So embrace your seemingly unimportant and inefficient interests. Paint, dance, code, run, read, write, sing, play, and dabble. And let nobody tell you that a designer shouldn’t write production code or a developer can’t also be a brilliant writer. If you are a generalist, be a generalist. It is who you are.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are excited to present a new release of Verge3D for Blender, an artist-friendly toolkit for creating 3D web interactives. Version 3.3 significantly speeds up the loading and the overall performance of your apps, introduces a code-less way to export Verge3D scenes to glTF format, and implements dynamic canvas textures. This release also brings several new Puzzles, many consistency improvements to the exporter plugin, support for Woocommerce’s global product attributes and many more features and improvements the full list of which you can find below.</p><h2>Loading Speed</h2><p>For this release we addressed user concerns regarding the loading speed of their applications. As such, we performed a series of optimizations for shader compilation, which is often the bottleneck for loading. As a result, we managed to achieve a significant acceleration of loading (up to 3 times for some scenes).</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-128x72.jpg 128w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div><p>The optimizations included:</p><ul><li>introduced parallel shader compilation, especially effective if the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/KHR_parallel_shader_compile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KHR_parallel_shader_compile</a> WebGL extension is present (before shaders were compiled one by one)</li><li>optimized the shader that represents the environment lighting</li><li>optimized the shaders that relate to real-time shadows</li><li>optimized the material shaders</li><li>loading stages restructured to smooth and speed up the overall loading process</li></ul><p>Some of these optimizations also improved Verge3D’s rendering performance, especially noticeable on low-end hardware or mobile devices.</p><h2>glTF export</h2><p>You can now export objects, groups of objects or entire scenes in glTF format. Both .gltf or .glb (binary) options are available.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/puzzle-export-gltf.jpg" alt="glTF export puzzle"></figure><p>This puzzle is capable of saving configurated objects from your applications.</p><p>For best results, as well as for creating standard glTF files (without Soft8Soft/Verge3D extensions) that can be viewed by third-party glTF viewers (such as Microsoft Windows 10’s default glTF viewer), we recommend you to use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#gltf_materials" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">glTF-compatible materials</a>.</p><h2>Camera Tweening Trajectory</h2><p>You can now choose the <em>spherical trajectory</em> with the <strong>tween camera</strong> puzzle. Spherical trajectory means that the camera will orbit around the pivot to a new position using the interpolated distance as radius.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory.jpg 635w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory-300x72.jpg 300w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory-600x145.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure><p>This is especially helpful when the new point of view is located behind the model. The spherical trajectory, which is natural for Orbit cameras, thus may prevent unpleasant intersections with the model on its way.</p><p>In addition, the <strong>tween camera</strong> puzzle now accepts coordinates alongside objects. Coordinates can be provided to this puzzle as lists or vectors.</p><h2>Canvas Textures</h2><p>The HTML canvas can now be used as a material texture. A&nbsp;<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>&nbsp;element can be created using the newly introduced HTML puzzle&nbsp;<strong>create canvas elem</strong>, and assigned as a material texture as usual, i.e. with the&nbsp;<strong>replace texture</strong>&nbsp;puzzle.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canvas-puzzle.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Once created, the canvas becomes available for drawing on it via JavaScript.

But it’s the hardware that’s letting it down. The Pixel 2 was a developer device, and as such it was easy to boot from the USB and whatnot.</p><p>But before this post becomes a Chromebook-off: it’s not.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al.

The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="description"><p>As developers, we are often talking about high-level architecture. I mean DDD, hexagonal architecture, and so on. We want to introduce those concepts to our project. We want to do that now! The new concept, new architecture, new language, new framework. We fall into a trap. Technical news is for us like drugs. We want more and more. And we don’t think about the consequences. The goal is noble. We want to have a good quality project which can easily adjust to new requirements. Unfortunately, the way we do that is not always the best. We need evolution, not revolution. We need small, conscious steps. Today I would like to discuss one of those kinds of steps. Very important and also very hard. I would like to talk with you about <strong>naming thing</strong>.</p><h2 id="why-naming-is-so-important">Why naming is so important?</h2><p>Naming thing?! It’s boring! You can think like that, but the truth is different. It’s one of the most important parts of programming. How you name things can change your perspective. Can add or remove some information from your context. The information is a powerful weapon in the programmer’s hand. If you call one of your classes <code>User</code>, what information this name gives you? Well, you can expect that this is a representation of a human, and he is using something. That’s all. But if you use a class name like <code>Guest</code>, <code>Gamer</code> or <code>Programmer</code>, you have more information. You know exactly, what that person does, what that person uses. The main question is: Do you need this information? As usual - it depends. You need to know the purpose of this name, what you want to achieve. Sometimes it is enough to have a <code>User</code>, but sometimes you need to be more precise.</p><h2 id="new-name-new-perspective">New name, new perspective</h2><p>Changing the name can give you a different perception, even a different context. It can allow you to look at the problem you are facing with from different angles. It’s like using six thinking hats by Dr. Edward de Bono. Each hat gives you a different perspective. Each hat focus on a specific area of the problem. The similar effect you can achieve with names. Take a look at the example below.</p><p>We want to get information about files from the S3 bucket. Of course, we have AWS SDK for that, but we want to be more specific. Adjust and wrap what AWS SDK gives us. So, we create a <strong>wrapper</strong> for that.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
 <span>class</span> <span>Wrapper</span>
   <span>def</span> <span>image_url</span>
   <span>end</span>

   <span>def</span> <span>get_file</span>
   <span>end</span>
   <span>...</span>
 <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>But wait, we just do file operations. We look for a file path, and we want to read/download the file from S3. Maybe we have something more than <code>Wrapper</code>. Maybe this is something like a <code>File</code>? A remote S3 file? Maybe we should think about that code not as a wrapper but as a remote S3 file:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>File</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>public_url</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>read</span>
    <span>end</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Don’t you think that this changed our perspective? I think so. Is the first name wrong? It depends. Our goal is important. We often say: <strong>Context is the king</strong>. The intention has meaning. The thing, we want to achieve. Good names are crucial for understanding the code. Sometimes we need many iterations for the name to be as descriptive as we want to. To show the right perspective on the problem. To be understood in the same way or at least in a very similar way through all the team. And even more, to have the same understanding with a client too. It’s the perfect situation when we use the same names/words during the development process not only in a development team but also with a client. We should create our common language - as Domain Driven Design calls it <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong>. It will allow us not only better understand our domain, our problem, and each other but also to see the right things and the connection between them.</p><h2 id="create-project-context-by-names">Create project context by names</h2><p>We are naming things that have meaning for us. Our words and our language shapes our world (problem or domain). Example from real life. Do you need one word for expressing a person very sensitive to the cold? People in Spain do. This word in Spanish is friolero. Or one word for telling about tiptoeing on hot sand? People in Nairobi have that word - hanyauku. It expresses their culture and the world around them. OK, but back to programming examples.</p><p>We have two names in the code:</p><p>You can look at these two variables for a long time, and it will be hard to understand their meaning. You can even think that this is a misspelling. Maybe someone just missed one letter <code>n</code> in the second variable? You need to go deeper into the code, spent some time reading it to understand what is going on. You will see that both variables are used. They have their declarations, so this is not a mistake. Then you can focus on the meaning. Plants have a scale of growth, which calls BBCH. They can be grouped in different stages of growing, blooming, or giving fruits. So, numbers 1 and 2 are this king of stages groups. Letter <code>n</code> is from how much nitrogen is in the soil during that stage. So <code>n1n2</code> is a multiplication of <code>n1</code> with <code>n2</code>. Variable <code>n12</code>, on the other hand, is a power of <code>n1</code> (multiplication <code>n1</code> with <code>n1</code>). Is it something you can easily get after reading these names? NO! Those names completely forget about context. They don’t explain their meanings, don’t create the language of the problem. In this situation, we should create specific language-related to the domain.</p><p>I hope those examples convinced you that names have a huge meaning. They can change your perspective, show code from different angles. Help you with understanding the problem, with the creation of the project language. Names can even help you with a better understanding of the project and show you the intention, bigger picture.</p><h2 id="13-tips-on-how-to-improve-names-in-the-project">13 tips on how to improve names in the project</h2><p>Now, this is a time for some tips to improve your names in the projects:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Name logical steps in your code</strong></p><p>When you have long calculations in your code, try to split them into smaller steps and descriptively name them. It will allow you and your team to understand the logic faster.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remaining_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>days</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>paid_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>-</span> <span>paid_amount</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div></li><li><p><strong>Names of methods should inform about what they really do</strong></p><p>For example, if a method changes the state of an object, it should inform you about this change. In Ruby, to do that, we use an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. Of course, this is only the names convention, so you can find methods that change the state but don’t have an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. No matter what, I think this is a good practice to use. The most important is to find a way to inform about what method really does.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use names for magic, static values in your code</strong></p><p>Give them meaning. Do not use 24. Instead of 24 use names like <code>day</code> and put it in the constant. In Ruby, we write a constant in an upper case like <code>DAY</code>. You have 7 in your code. Tell other team members that you mean <code>WEEK</code>. It will help you with communication via code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use descriptive names</strong></p><p>No more single-letter names. Use descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, or modules. Create context for your code by using good and descriptive names. Allow other people in your team to quickly understand the code meaning based on names. If the name isn’t as precise as it should be, change it. Sometimes you need to do many iterations with the name to get the effect you want. It’s normal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose the name to a specific level of abstraction</strong></p><p>It’s a hard one. Sometimes the name can be descriptive, but tells us too much or not enough on a specific level of abstraction. For example:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>create_tmp_file</span><span>(</span><span>image_path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I think <code>image_path</code> quite good tells what it is. It’s a path for an image file. But wait! Is that method only for image files or can be used in a wider context? Maybe the same code can be called for all kinds of files? When we have a name like <code>image_path</code> we narrow the usability of this function. It’s the name that isn’t good at this level of abstraction. Instead of <code>image_path</code> use <code>file_path</code>. It will show that you can put as an argument any file path.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your programming language standards and conventions</strong></p><p>In Ruby, when you have to return a Boolean value, you should end it with a question mark <code>?</code> like <code>blank?</code>. When you want to convert an object to a string, you should use <code>to_s</code>. There is a lot of this kind conventions. Try to use your language conventions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tell what pattern you use</strong></p><p>I think it can help you with understanding the architecture. Try to use design patterns names in your code. For example, you have a <code>User</code> class, and you want to decorate it. You can create a <code>UserDecorator</code> class. Maybe even <code>AdminUserDecorator</code> if this is what it will decorate. More you are precise in your names, then better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your project standards and conventions</strong></p><p>When you have a complex domain, your project will need more conventions then only language level conventions. It’s why it is a good idea to create your project <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> and use it everywhere in the project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unequivocal names</strong></p><p>Try to create names that tell exactly what they really do. Name like <code>create_record</code> can be too general for your code. Maybe in your context name <code>create_blank_record</code> will be better. Don’t afraid long names too much. If you use the name once or twice, it’s OK to have a longer, more precise name.</p></li><li><p><strong>The longer scope, the longer name too</strong></p><p>If you have a short local scope, like a small loop, it is OK to use a variable like <code>i</code> to iterate by some range. But if you have a longer scope, like class scope, it will be much better to use more descriptive names. The longer scope you have, the longer, more descriptive names you should use. It will allow you to know exactly what is inside the variable. Remember also to don’t go with long names too much. At some point, long names also can be not clear and bring more complexity then readability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not use prefixes or suffixes with type or sub-domains</strong></p><p>It’s related to Hungarian notation too. Do not create a name like <code>i_age</code> because this is an <code>Integer</code> type of age value or <code>CRMInvoice</code>. It will be better to do <code>CRM::Invoice</code>. It will help you to put files into the right directories. If your whole system is …</p></li></ol></div></article></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/automated-content-distribution | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/automated-content-distribution">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>‍</p><p>Just recently, I started writing in public. First on '<a href="https://cowriters.app/" target="_blank">200 Words a Day</a>' (now called Cowriters); a digital community of people trying to keep up "writing at least 200 words per day", every day. After that, I started writing on&nbsp;Medium, which is a blogging platform. Then a little later, when I felt I could rationalize to myself&nbsp;the work of <a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6" target="_blank">building a website with webflow</a>, I started on my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2>What channel? All channels!</h2><p>What I noticed posting on separate channels, is that different people hang out in various communities.&nbsp;</p><p>But these communities don't necessarily overlap. So some of my acquaintances, friends and family wouldn't see my&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran" target="_blank">Twitter</a>&nbsp;posts, while others only saw what I posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibranelbazi/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(Btw, I don't have Facebook or Instagram, so that is why there's nothing for me to talk about.)</em></p><p>This fragmentation of communities is no problem, of course.<strong> Everyone hangs out where they want to.</strong> But I did feel I wanted to reach some more people with my blog posts. And seeing my blog was new, it had not yet had the opportunity to rank in Google.</p><p>So I set out to post my articles on <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/how-to-divide-your-online-channels-in-the-4-most-important-segments">separate channels</a> by hand, which quickly turns into a repetitive chore. I don't like tedious tasks, <strong>which is why I automated the process </strong>— the details of which you can find below.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, I talk about what I automated, what tools I used, and how I set up the process automation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hopefully, you can use it for your processes!</strong></p><h2>Automation overview</h2><p>For every blog post I publish on my blog, I&nbsp;have automated a few steps:</p><p><strong>In Integromat:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Retrieve last published Article from Webflow</li><li>Search in an Airtable base if the article has already been published and shared before.</li><li>Extract the Category-ID of the article from the Webflow-object and map it to the right Category.</li><li>Check to which secondary flow (after the 'Router in Integromat) the article belongs.</li><li>Share the article on Twitter</li><li>Share the article on LinkedIn</li><li>Publish the article on 200-Words-a-Day</li><li>Retrieve the 200-Words-a-Day article URL</li><li>Save all article data in a 'Published Posts' table in Airtable</li></ul><p><strong>In Zapier:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Publish the article on Medium by retrieving the article data from Airtable</li></ul><h2>The Tools</h2><p><a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran" target="_blank">Integromat</a>&nbsp;- "... is the glue of the internet." As they say. And this is undoubtedly true. You can go as detailed with your process automation as you want here, all without writing code.</p><p><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>&nbsp;- No glue but equal in impact. (Maybe the duct tape of the internet?) Zapier sports the most extensive (1500+ different apps) set of API integrations you can find.</p><p><a href="https://airtable.com/" target="_blank">Airtable</a>&nbsp;- A mix between a database and Excel, with connections to almost every app you can think of (through Zapier or Integromat).</p><p><a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6" target="_blank">Webflow</a>&nbsp;- Build beautiful custom websites, without any code. Know how to work with Photoshop? You can build awesome websites that contain a CMS (Content Management System)!</p><h2>My Channels</h2><p><strong>Blog&nbsp;</strong>- This blog.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran"><strong>Twitter&nbsp;</strong></a>- I think you know what Twitter is. Short, 280-character messages back and forth with others, publicly, on the web. I am sharing my blog posts as 'Links' there.</p><p><strong>LinkedIn&nbsp;</strong>- This is a social media platform geared towards Professional life. I am sharing my articles as 'Posts' there currently.</p><p><strong>Medium&nbsp;</strong>- A blogging platform. I republish my blogposts there for a different audience.</p><p><strong>200 Words a Day / Cowriters</strong>&nbsp;- Republishing my articles there too. No images are possible, though.<br></p><h2>The steps in detail</h2><figure id="w-node-a98072bd58f6-8ab48f91"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9f07d3a410722397e9fd77/5db6fc1910098f6a1dc7b8da_fullflow.JPG" alt=""></p><figcaption>The full flow in <a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran">Integromat</a>.

It takes a few tries to get the format right. But it is just HTML.</figcaption></figure><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>I just started using Integromat as one of my automation tools, and<strong> I love it so far.</strong> I found it a few years back, but it didn't have that many integrations yet (hence, I used Zapier exclusively for the last four years). <strong>But integromat has grown and improved a lot!</strong></p><p>So I set out to challenge myself and set up the automation of publishing/sharing my blog posts entirely in <a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran">Integromat </a>(with supportive tools like <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable </a>and <a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6">Webflow</a>, of course).</p><p>Only one part of the process I couldn't get in Integromat, which is publishing to Medium. For that, you need to have a separate API-key from Medium (which I still have not received). <strong>Thus for that part of the process I used Zapier, which was easy peasy.</strong></p><p>By the way, I know there are services out there that do this (publishing automation) for you. But I like to have control over the specific format and filters of my processes. <strong>Also, I very much like building these automation flows.</strong></p><p>The flows are not perfect though. For example, I need to add the image source by hand on Medium.</p><p>What I still want to do is to add a flow where, when I update a post, it also updates on all channels I republished.</p><p>I genuinely hope you got some value out of this article. And if you have any input or tips for this automation specifically, please reach out! :)</p><h2>Support</h2><p>If you'd like to see more content like this in your inbox, I'd be thrilled to have you join my <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/newsletter">mailing list.</a></p><p>If you're feeling generous, please do show some love to this thread on Twitter.</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I automated 🤖 the content distribution for my blog.</p><p>Here are the steps in detail of how I did this (so you can emulate it)!</p><p>I think <a href="https://twitter.com/makerpad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@makerpad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nocodelife?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nocodelife</a> could be interested.</p><p>In this thread:<br>1⃣ Overview<br>2⃣ The Tools<br>3⃣ Channels<br>4⃣ The steps in detail</p><p>Let's go! 🤓</p><p>1/14 <a href="https://t.co/NzLnEqeAgZ">pic.twitter.com/NzLnEqeAgZ</a></p></div>— Jibran (@AskJibran) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran/status/1288406148136173571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div></article></div>]]>

							<p>On utilise une <a title="Voir représentation graphique sur Wikipédia" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repr%C3%A9sentation_graphique_de_donn%C3%A9es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">représentation graphique</a>&nbsp;pour faciliter l’interprétation des données, voir la proportion (l’importance) d’une valeur par rapport à un ensemble de valeurs, comparer les valeurs ou décrire une évolution, ...</p>
<p>Sur une page web, nous pouvons utiliser la librairie JavaScript <a title="Aller vers la page Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Charts</strong></a> pour représenter les données dans un graphique par des diagrammes interactifs tels que :</p>
<ul>
<li>Pie Chart : diagramme circulaire (« camembert » en France)</li>
<li>Bar Chart : histogramme, sous forme des bâtons</li>
<li>Line Chart</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Ce guide vous présente la technique pour représenter ou visualiser les données provenant d'une base de données avec Google Pie Chart et Bar Chart sur une vue (template Blade) dans un projet <a title="Aller vers le site web officiel Laravel" href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laravel</a>.</p>

							<h2 id="integrer-google-charts-dans-laravel">Intégrer Google Charts dans Laravel</h2>

							<p>La documentation sur <a title="Aller vers la galerie Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">la galerie Google Charts</a> présente le code source à utiliser pour reproduire un diagramme sélectionné.</p>
<p>La technique pour intégrer un diagramme dans un projet Laravel consiste à copier le code source présenté, le ramener (coller) sur une page ou une vue (template Blade), le personnaliser et adapter les données à celles de votre application :</p>
<ol>
<li>Copier le code source d’un chart depuis la galerie Google Chart</li>
<li>Coller le code source du chart sur votre page ou template Blade</li>
<li>Remplacer les valeurs du chart par celles de votre application</li>
</ol>
<p>Pour expliciter cette technique, nous allons prendre deux exemples d’intégration en récupérant les données de la base de données, les organisant pour les représenter au diagramme. Nous aurons pour cela besoin d’une route « diagram », d’un contrôleur « DiagramController » et d’une vue « diagram ».</p>
<p>Ajoutons la route « diagram » au fichier <strong>routes\php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>// La route pour afficher le diagramme
Route::get("diagram", "DiagramController@diagram")-&gt;name("diagram");</code></pre>
<p>L’action « diagram » de la route nommée « diagram » est gérée par le contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> que nous pouvons générer en exécutant la commande <em>artisan </em>suivante :</p>
<pre><code>php artisan make:controller DiagramController</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la logique de la méthode <code>diagram()</code> pour les données de chaque diagramme :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		$data = collect(); // Les données du diagramme

		// La vue "diagram"
		return view("diagram", compact('data'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Et la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> qui présente le diagramme avec les valeurs :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()-&gt;getLocale()) }}"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSRF Token --&gt;
    &lt;meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Laravel - Google Chart&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- Scripts --&gt;
    &lt;script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSS --&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
	
	&lt;h1&gt;Mon diagramme&lt;/h1&gt;

	&lt;!-- L'élément "#mon-chart" où placer le chart --&gt;
	&lt;div id="mon-chart" style="height: 500px; width: 800px;" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	// Le code du Chart
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la partie <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> pour chaque diagramme.&nbsp; Mon diagramme sera placé dans l'élément <code>&lt;div id="mon-chart" &gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<p>L’arborescence des fichiers avec lesquels nous allons travailler est la suivante :</p>
<ul>
<li>app\Http\Controllers\<strong>DiagramController.php</strong></li>
<li>resources\views\<strong>diagram.blade.php</strong></li>
<li>routes\<strong>web.php</strong></li>
</ul>

															
							
							<h2 id="exemples-dintegration-google-pie-et-bar-charts">Exemples d'intégration Google Pie et Bar Charts</h2>

							<h3>Exemple 1 : Intégrer Google Pie Chart</h3>
<p>Supposons pour un site web e-commerce avoir une table « categories » dont le model <strong>App\Category.php</strong> représente une catégorie des produits (Ex : charcuterie, pâtisserie, viande, …) :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Chaque catégorie possède plusieurs produits. Nous voulons afficher la proportion des produits pour chaque catégorie dans un diagramme circulaire.</p>
<p>Pource faire, nous pouvons récupérer les catégories avec leurs produits de la manière suivante au contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

use App\Category;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		// Les catégories avec les produits
		$categories = Category::with("products")-&gt;get();

		// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
		return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Puis intégrer les données au <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Pie Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Pie</strong></a> sur la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {

    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégories', 'Produits'],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ "{{ $category-&gt;name }}", {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }} ], // Proportion des produits de la catégorie
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      title: 'Proportion des produits par catégorie', // Le titre
      is3D : true // En 3D
    };

    // On crée le chart en indiquant l'élément où le placer "#mon-chart"
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    // On désine le chart avec les données et les options
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1Y0e-UmRIC_RwCni2XB8xHeom6JUjmjRV" alt="Google Pie Chart avec des données d'une app Laravel"></p>
<h3>Exemple 2 : Intégrer Google Bar Chart</h3>
<p>Reprenons les mêmes données catégories avec produits. Nous voulons cette fois visualiser dans un histogramme le rapport quantité produits / ventes pour chaque catégorie.</p>
<p>Pour le nombre des ventes par catégorie, nous avons la relation suivante avec la table des ventes « sales » au modèle <strong>App\Category.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }

    // Les ventes de la catégorie
    public function sales () {
        return $this-&gt;hasManyThrough(Sale::class, Product::class);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Récupérons les catégories avec les produits et les ventes dans la méthode <code>diagram()</code> du contrôleur&nbsp;<strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>public function diagram () {

	// Les catégories avec les produits et les ventes
	$categories = Category::with("products", "sales")-&gt;get();

	// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
	return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

}</code></pre>
<p>Enfin, intégrons les données au&nbsp;<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Bar Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Bar Chart</strong></a> sur la vue&nbsp; <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['bar']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégorie', 'Produits', 'Ventes' ],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ '{{ $category-&gt;name }}', {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }}, {{ $category-&gt;sales-&gt;count() }} ],
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      chart: {
        title: 'Performance Catégories - Produits - Ventes',
        subtitle: 'Produits, Ventes pour chaque catégorie',
      },
      bars: 'vertical' // Direction "verticale" pour les bars
    };

    var chart = new google.charts.Bar(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    chart.draw(data, google.charts.Bar.convertOptions(options));
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1b0H6z_LXO4bQKJ5iuo5KuRSPQdmY__n7" alt="Google Bar Chart avec les données d'une app Laravel"></p>

We know the knowns and our existing SRE toolchain does a very good job of validating them. In that sense, existing metrics are our tells and our tools are like Clever Hans, which happily tap away to verify what we know. What existing tools or limited metrics don’t tell us are hidden anomalies that manifest as faint glimmers in incidents when we are in fire fighting mode.</p><p>A single node failure of a standalone 3 node load balancer app has vastly different implications than a single node failure in a system where the faulty node has both upstream and downstream dependencies. Similarly, if you did not have distributed tracing, how would you map a request journey in a microservices based system? Systems evolved, problems evolved and hence tooling evolved. In the absence of tooling that evolves with problems, we are fooling ourselves to believe that our alarms cover the whole outage domain, akin to saying that Clever Hans knows math.</p><p>Making Clever Hans do math is impossible, but choosing tools that solve todayâ€™s problems and anticipate near future needs is tractable. Staying in lockstep with the problem domain of system as it evolves is key. Detecting where your existing tooling falls short and filling those gaps is a learnable skill. During that process, you will realize that marrying your existing toolchain or shoehorning problems to fit a familiar tool is counter productive.</p><p>So do you adopt every shiny new tool that shows up on hackernews? No. Exploring a tool to do a test run is one thing, ensuring enterprise adoption across teams is another. Weigh the benefits against the switching cost. Is it worth switching if the system you are solving problems for is sunsetting in the next 3 months? Conversely, isnâ€™t it worth evaluating a CI/CD tool if your team is spending most of their time doing manual deployments? These are real questions that go beyond the shimmer of superficial concerns like – <em>Is it written in my favourite programming language? Is it the next best thing I could put on my resume?</em></p><h3><span id="Takeaways"></span>Takeaways<span></span></h3><ul><li>Know your Clever Hans toolchain. Put on your poker face and ask hard subjective questions.</li><li>Bend the solutions to your problem, not new problems to old solutions.</li><li>Own your toolchain and not the other way around.</li><li>If the only tool you know is a hammer, everything will look like a nail. Identify those hammers. Be on the lookout for power drills.</li></ul><hr> <!-- Mailchimp for WordPress v4.7.7 - https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/ --><!-- / Mailchimp for WordPress Plugin --><hr></div> <!-- .entry-content --></article> <!-- .post --></div> <!-- #content .site-content --></div> <!-- #primary .content-area --> <!-- #secondary .widget-area .sidebar --></div> <!-- layout --></div></div>]]>

<p>Galaksija was to be in Yugoslavia what Commodore and Sinclair were in the west. Whether it succeeded or not, its deceptively simple design can still teach us a lot of interesting tricks on how to make a usable computer and operating system with as few transistors and bits as possible.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
                <p>In this article, I’m going to cover various exploits that can work against the Django templating engine in a modern web application.</p>
<p>I’ll show how and why they work, as exploits, the risks of leaving them unfixed. Then, I’ll show you how to find them using a fuzzer I’ve been developing.</p>
<h2>A quick introduction to Cross-Site-Scripting</h2>
<p>Cross-Site-Scripting, or XSS, is the technique of exploiting web applications to cause trick users’ browsers to executing arbitrary (and malicious) JavaScript.</p>
<p>The malicious JavaScript code would be targeted to accomplish something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing users passwords without their knowledge</li>
<li>Data gathering</li>
<li>Executing arbitrary actions</li>
</ul>
<p>This exploit works based on the assumption that the HTML and JavaScript served from a website’s server is “trusted”.</p>
<p>If you visit your favourite website, you’d expect that the HTML and JavaScript served to you and rendered in your browser is “safe”. Because of the mix between User-Generated-Content (UGC) and static content in
most modern applications,</p>
<p>Some common examples of content which is rendered as part of the site DOM from a database would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A comments section at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Names or profile pictures of users</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of putting in their name as “Jim Smith”</p>
<pre><code>Article posted by {{ user }}.
</code></pre>

<p>This is fine if <code>user = "Jim Smith"</code>, but if Jim is a bit more callous, then he could enter his name as <code>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Anyone viewing this page would then see the GIF that Jim injected into his username:</p>
<pre><code>Article posted by &lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of Stored/Permanent XSS. There are 2 groups of XSS exploits, which we’ll explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reflected XSS</li>
<li>Stored/Permanent XSS</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reflected XSS</h3>
<p>Reflected XSS is common in both server-side and client-side applications. A common XSS flaw in applications that attackers will seek out
is a search page. Take this (very) simple example of a HTML + JavaScript page for showing a form asking for a search query
and showing what the user searched for if the GET parameters is existent.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en-AU"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="get"&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="query" name="query" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;!-- The results of the search query --&gt;

&lt;script type="application/javascript"&gt;
    var searchParams = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search);
    if (searchParams.has("query"))
    {
        document.getElementById("search-query").innerHTML = "You searched for " + searchParams.get("query")
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Your regular user would search a text string which is shown on the page:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/simple-search.png"></p>
<p>An attacker could search for any valid HTML and it would become part of the DOM:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/guacamole-dance.gif"></p>
<p>In the reflective XSS model, the malicious payload is sent back to the attacker. This type of attack is less-dangerous than permanent XSS.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/reflective-xss.png"></p>
<p>Reflective XSS attacks are used by attackers sending a link and tricking a user to show the reflected payload to accomplish the hack.</p>
<h3>Stored/Permanent XSS</h3>
<p>Permanent XSS attacks are far more dangerous to an application because the attack has the opporunity to impact all of the users of the site, including the site administrators.</p>
<p>The attack mechanism is the same as reflective, but the server-side application stores the malicious payload in a database, or a file of some sort:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/permanent-xss.png"></p>
<p>Some really-basic examples I shared were user names, comments, and profile photos.</p>
<p>Permanent XSS attacks are often used for</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a “beacon” to the attacker with some details about the target, such as their IP address, user name, browser, OS, password, etc.</li>
<li>Making POST requests to parts of the application which let the attacker take over an account by changing the password.</li>
<li>Combining with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVHX9jDrI0o">SQL Injection</a> vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data from the database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Django fights back</h2>
<p>Django assumes that all context data is “unsafe” unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>most</strong> forms of XSS attack don’t work with Django templates.</p>
<p>For example, if you wrote the following template:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en-AU"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="get"&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="query" name="query" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query }}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Django would automatically escape the malicious string in the <code>query</code> context variable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It does this by passing all string data through Python’s <code>html.escape()</code> function.
This function will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace any <code>&amp;</code> with an <code>&amp;amp;</code> ampersand HTML character-reference</li>
<li>Replace any <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> with an <code>&amp;lt;</code> or <code>&amp;gt;</code> HTML character-reference</li>
<li>Replace any <code>"</code> with an escaped <code>\"</code></li>
<li>Replace any <code>'</code> with an escaped <code>\'</code></li>
</ol>
<p>To say that this escaping of these 5 characters “protects” your application is a gross-underestimation of XSS.</p>
<h2>Caveats to Django XSS protection</h2>
<p>There are many caveats to Django XSS protection, and as you learn more about XSS you’ll be able to spot them in your templates.</p>
<h3>1. It only applies to the Django template engine</h3>
<p>The XSS protection for Django is part of the Django templating engine. If your application heavily uses a client-side JavaScript frame (such as Angular, Vue, React)
then the Django XSS protection is not helping you.</p>
<p>An example of a reflective XSS vulnerability is a third-party JavaScript component on your page. Many third-party JavaScript components, such as type-ahead widgets have XSS flaws.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many Django extensions that rely on combined JavaScript/Python logic have XSS flaws. These include many form extensions like Date/Time selectors. Some of these flaws have been discovered and fixed,
but many go unnoticed.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check your JavaScript and Python dependencies against a CVE database like Snyk.io</li>
<li>Test the whole application (see later in this article) with malicous payloads</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. It does not protect against the misuse of “Safe Strings”</h3>
<p>The Django XSS protection can be disabled when a string is marked as “safe”, either in the View logic by using the <code>mark_safe()</code> function, or in the template using the <code>safe</code> filter.</p>
<pre><code>format_html("{} &lt;b&gt;{}&lt;/b&gt; {}",
    mark_safe(some_html),
    some_text,
    some_other_text,
)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, in the template you can use the <code>safe</code> filter to disable the HTML escape protection:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query | safe }}&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This may seem obvious that by explicitly disabling XSS protection that it doesn’t protect you against XSS, but <em>“Use <code>mark_safe()</code>“</em> is an accepted solution to a worrying number of Django questions
on StackOverflow.com.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Search your code base for use of the <code>safe</code> filter</li>
<li>Search your code base for the use of <code>mark_safe</code> function by using [my PyCharm extension]</li>
<li>Use bleach to clean out any potentially vulnerable attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a filter tag that I wrote to convert using Bleach to remove any potentially harmful data:</p>
<pre><code>from django import template
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
import bleach

register = template.Library()
_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES = {
        'a': ['href', 'title'],
        'img': ['src', 'class'],
        'table': ['class']
}
_ALLOWED_TAGS = ['b', 'i', 'ul', 'li', 'p', 'br', 'a', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'ol', 'img', 'strong', 'code', 'em', 'blockquote',
    'table', 'thead', 'tr', 'td', 'tbody', 'th']

@register.filter()
def safer(text):
    return mark_safe(bleach.clean(text, tags=_ALLOWED_TAGS, attributes=_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES))
</code></pre>

<p>You’d use this tag as a drop-in replacement for <code>safe</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query | safer }}&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>3. Some types of attribute escape are not protected</h3>
<p>Many XSS techniques use HTML/JavaScript event handlers as attributes of existing tags instead of new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p>For example, many HTML elements support an <code>onload</code> event. The HTML can have any JavaScript action as a trigger and it doesn’t require any user interaction:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=/img/home-bg.jpg onload=alert(1)&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If your Django template had the <code>src</code> attribute replaced with a context variable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src={{ profile_photo }}&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The attacker would set their profile photo URL to <code>"/img/home-bg.jpg onload=alert(1)"</code> to accomplish this attack.
Because you didn’t encapsulate the <code>src</code> attribute in quotes, the Django XSS protection won’t escape the input.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always quote your attributes if they come from user-generated/untrusted sources</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. It does not protect against other attributes which accept JavaScript</h3>
<p>Let’s say you let your users add a link to their personal website that shows up on their profile page inside your application.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="{{ user.profile_url }}"&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Well, the attacker can just put <code>"javascript:do_stuff(xxvb)"</code> as the link to their website, so if the user clicks on the link, it executes whatever JavaScript the attacker wishes.</p>
<p>You could check for <code>user.profile_url.startswith("javascript:")</code>, however the following are also valid in most browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;a href="JaVaScript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the protocol is case insensitive)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="    javascript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x01-\x20 are allowed before the protocol)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="javas   cript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x09,\x0a,\x0d are allowed inside the protocol)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="javascript \x09:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x09,\x0a,\x0d are allowed after protocol name before the colon)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sanitize links before they’re stored in the database, or</li>
<li>Don’t offer this behaviour on the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <code>html.escape()</code> does not escape JavaScript template strings</h3>
<p>The escape function that Django XSS protection uses will escape the string quotes <code>'</code> and <code>"</code>.</p>
<p><code>html.escape()</code> <strong>does not</strong> escape the backtick ``` used in ECMAScript Template literals. Template literals are part of the …</p></div></div></div>

<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>

<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>

<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w"></figure>
<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly performing plant.</p>

July 28, 2020 | https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>We are very happy to announce that Ant Media Server v2.1 is released with some more great new features such as HEVC(H.265) support in WebRTC stack and WebM Recording. Previously <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-vp8-data-channel-and-4k-60fps-support/">In Ant Media Server v2.0</a>, VP8 and <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">Data Channel</a> features were released. We are continuously adding new features and doing performance optimizations. Before starting the post, let me thank you for your all interest to the Ant Media Server because you’ve made it run in more than 120 countries.After a brief introduction, let’s start the post.</p> <p>I think the most important feature in this release is the HEVC (H.265) support in WebRTC stack because it shows that what Ant Media can do beyond the limits in the industry. Of course, there are many more features and improvements such WebM recording, Unified Plan or PlanB,&nbsp; forcing quality in WebRTC playback, etc. Let me give the highlights for v2.1 and then you can also take a look the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole change log</a> for sure.</p> <h2>HEVC(H.265) Support in WebRTC Stack</h2> <p>I think the main question is about why it’s important to add HEVC aka. H265 support in WebRTC stack. The answer is clear: <strong>Providing better quality with the same bitrate.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg" alt="Ant Media Server HEVC Support in WebRTC" width="1022" height="376" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg 1022w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-300x110.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-768x283.jpg 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-600x221.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 1"></p> <p>Let me tell what we’ve done in Ant Media Server side. We originally use the <a href="https://webrtc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WebRTC stack implemented by Google</a> and we’ve made it scalable to work in the server side. The recent changes is adding packetization and depacketization of HEVC frames in RTP protocol according to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7798" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 7789</a> and adapting these changes to the WebRTC stack.&nbsp; &nbsp;We’ve also adapted these changes to the Android WebRTC SDK because most of the android devices have H.265 decoder to play the H.265 encoded WebRTC Stream.&nbsp; Before proceeding how to test HEVC, let us tell that HEVC support is an experimental feature for now.</p> <h2>How to Play HEVC WebRTC Stream in Ant Media Server</h2> <p>Most of the devices(mobile or desktop) do not have H.265 Encoder to be able use in WebRTC stack. Luckily, Android devices have H.265 decoder to play H.265 encoded streams. So it works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</li> <li>Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</li> <li>Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</li> </ol> <h3>1. Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</h3> <p>By default H.265 support is disabled in Ant Media Server so we need to enable it first. After you install the Ant Media Server,</p> <ul> <li>Open the following file <pre>/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties</pre> </li> <li>Enable H265 by adding below property to the file above <pre>settings.h265Enabled=true</pre> <p>I think we should also point out that Ant Media Server uses libx265 for soft encoding and it also support hevc_nvenc for hard encoding.</p></li> <li>Then make the following changes in the file as follows <pre>settings.vp8Enabled=false
settings.h264Enabled=false
settings.encoderSettingsString=360,800000,64000</pre> </li> <li>Save the file and restart the Ant Media Server <pre>sudo service antmedia restart</pre> </li> </ul> <h3>2. Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</h3> <p>You can send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server with <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Open-Broadcaster-Software-Publishing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OBS as documented here</a>. Just send a stream with height 360p or over.</p> <h3>3. Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</h3> <p>With the new Android SDK, you don’t need to do anything. Just add your server address to the MainActivity and change the mode to Play and open the Activity. It’ll play the H.265 Encoded WebRTC on your Android Device. You can even check the incoming and outgoing SDPs to see the HEVC parameters there.</p> <h4>Good news for Android and IOS SDKs</h4> <p>We’ve decided to provide Android and iOS SDK’s for free. It’ll be available to download on <a href="https://antmedia.io/">antmedia.io</a> later this week.</p> <h2>WebM Recording</h2> <p>In this release, we’re also happy to announce WebM Recording. You can configure WebM recording the same way you do for MP4 recording.&nbsp; Let me tell what I mean.</p>  <h2>Improved Performance and Stability</h2> <p>We constantly improve performance and stability. With this release, there are less threads in both Java and Native side. It means there are less context switching in the same name number of publishers and viewers according to the previous version. We’ve also optimized the WebRTC Stack&nbsp; to make it consume less resources.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 2" width="489" height="302" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png 489w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4"></p> <p>Second improvement is about stability. We’ve improved our devops pipeline for cluster tests. So we’re having more integration test cases for both standalone and cluster modes. Moreover, we’ve also increased our quality gate for test coverage from %70 to %80.</p>  <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 3" width="500" height="145" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png 832w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-300x87.png 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-768x223.png 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-600x175.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 5"></p> <h2>Force WebRTC Playback Quality in Adaptive Bitrate</h2> <p>Here is the another feature that we’ve got so many requests about that. Let me explain it. When there are multi-bitrates in the server side, Ant Media Server measures the viewers internet speed and sends the best quality according to the internet speed of the viewer.&nbsp; For instance,</p> <ul> <li>Assume that there are two bitrates on the server <ul> <li>First one is 360p and 800kbps</li> <li>Second one is 480p and 1500kbps.</li> </ul> </li> <li>if Viewer internet speed <ul> <li>is above 1500kbps, then the resolution with 480p is sent.</li> <li>is between 800kbps and 1500kbps or less than 800kbps, then the resolution with 360p is sent.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This is done automatically on the server side. However some users want to force the resolution and don’t want to the server to make it automatically.&nbsp; So we’ve defined a new message in websocket communication&nbsp; and implement it on server side and JS SDK side. It’s <em>forceStreamQuality&nbsp; </em>which is having two parameters <em>streamId</em> and <em>streamHeight.&nbsp; </em>You can get the streamHeights information by <em>getStreamInfo </em>message. Let me explain how.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg 360w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-300x200.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 6"></p> <p>Assume that you are <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Playing" rel="dofollow noopener" target="_blank">playing a WebRTC stream</a> that has some <a href="https://antmedia.io/adaptive-streaming-is-supported-for-live-streams-on-the-fly/">adaptive bitrates</a> on the server side. It means that you’ve created WebRTCAdaptor and call <em>getStreamInfo </em>after you receive <em>play_started</em> message.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.getStreamInfo("{your_stream_Id}");</pre> <p>The method above will trigger the <em>streamInformation </em>callback and you can parse it with the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/StreamApp/blob/master/src/main/webapp/player.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">same way in this file</a>. Then the only thing is calling <em>forceStreamQuality </em>as follows.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.forceStreamQuality("{your_stream_Id}",&nbsp; {the_resolution_to_be_forced});</pre> <p>We’ll provide this to be very easy to use in the embedded player as a built-in feature in the next release.</p> <p>To sum up,&nbsp; these are the highlights for v2.1. You can check <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole release notes here</a> .Thank you again for your interest to Ant Media Server and we have some more exciting things on their way. Stay tuned and keep in touch.</p>  </div></div>]]>

<br><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/i.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="11"><span size="+1">n
October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><em>Serverless approach to real-time analytics now decouples storage from compute in the cloud to outperform operational model of Elasticsearch, Apache Druid and others</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SAN MATEO, Calif.</strong> – July 28th, 2020 – <a href="https://rockset.com/">Rockset</a>, the real-time indexing database company, today announced new product features—including decoupling of storage from compute in the cloud, and separation of query-compute from ingest-compute—further eliminating the operational barriers in achieving real-time analytics at scale.</p>
<p>To stay ahead in the digital economy, companies need to personalize user experiences, build real-time decision systems and automate actions using sensor data. These types of  applications demand both very low latency and complex analytical queries on a variety of data formats from different sources. Since real-time data is messy and bursty, the high operational cost and complexity in ingesting and querying real-time data at scale has been a major barrier for enterprises moving from batch to real-time.</p>
<p>Built by the creators of <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/rocksdb-is-eating-the-database-world/">RocksDB</a>, Rockset automatically builds Converged Indexes™ on any data—including structured, semi-structured, geographical and time series data—for high performance search and analytics at scale. It supports real-time SQL queries on semi-structured data, so for the first time ever, developers have the flexibility to build features that search, aggregate and join any type of data from any source on the fly. When combined with serverless operations, it is a game-changing approach to making real-time analytics fast, flexible and easy.</p>
<p>With this new release, Rockset decouples query-compute, ingest-compute and hot storage in the cloud, allowing developers to scale the exact resources needed in the cloud and seamlessly adapt to variability. Traditional systems suffer from compute contention during bursty ingest or spikes in queries, so data becomes stale and queries slow down—making it operationally challenging to enable real-time decisions. Separating query compute from ingest compute avoids resource contention, and as a result, data freshness is guaranteed and query performance is never compromised. Additionally, while new data continues to stream in, old data grows over time and is less frequently queried. Scaling storage independently from compute allows customers to seamlessly control their price-performance over the lifecycle of the dataset, simply by adjusting the compute allocation over time.</p>
<p>Rumble Wellness, a company that encourages a healthy lifestyle by rewarding users based on their daily step count, uses real-time data to increase user engagement. "Rockset is pure magic. We chose Rockset over Druid, because it requires no planning whatsoever in terms of indexes or scaling. In one hour, we were up and running, serving complex OLAP queries for our live leaderboards and dashboards at very high queries per second. As we grow in traffic, we can just ‘turn a knob’ and Rockset scales with us," said Yaron Levi, Chief Architect at Rumble Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>With the new release:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is served from hot storage, and automatically backed up on durable cloud storage, with per-GB pricing.</li>
<li>Compute resources are scaled independently as required, with per-minute billing.</li>
<li>The compute resources are used for ingesting data or querying data from hot storage. Scaling compute resources results in instant performance gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>“First-generation real-time analytics solutions like Elasticsearch and Druid tightly coupled storage and compute because they were optimized for the datacenter era. But this leads to over-provisioning of resources and makes it difficult to manage costs at scale,” said Dhruba Borthakur, co-founder and CTO, Rockset. “On the other hand, scaling storage and compute independently in the cloud provides the benefits of improved scalability, availability and better price-performance ratios. Rockset’s cloud-native architecture and serverless technology already enables massive operational gains for customers, and these new features will further enable developers to achieve real-time analytics at scale.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.15.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>I’ve recently co-founded a startup, and after working so long in more mature enterprises with diverse toolchains, it was actually massively educational to return to first steps and figure out what our critical needs were, balanced with essentially zero budget. As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer. Used free for months, and only started paying once we wanted to bring in external users etc., and even then it’s insanely cheap for the value we derive.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-7irdv"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>AWS</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re building on AWS, and never really considered using anything else. There are a number of ways to get your hands on AWS credits too, some banks (eg </span><a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>SVB</u></span></a><span>) offer startup credits, as well as some credit cards etc. - we found that by leveraging our networks and partners we were able to get most of our AWS usage free for the first year, which is massive when there’s no revenue.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4mdtf"><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Jira</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>. Not much to say here, you gotta put your code somewhere and we’re using both for various projects. And they’re only getting more free by the day. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-576uc"><p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Quickbooks</strong></u></span></a><span>. I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now. Stripe integration with our app was brain-dead simple, and the cost is peanuts compared to the value we get, especially given they only get paid when we do.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4fpta"><p><a href="https://reclaim.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Reclaim</strong></u></span></a><span>. We didn’t know we needed Reclaim until we did. Startup life began as a welcome return to meeting-free days with time to work and GSD… for like two weeks. Reclaim works perfectly and noise-lessly to manage our calendars, and is free.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-34v18"><p><a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Miro</strong></u></span></a><span>. From day one, our team was remote, with team members ranging from San Francisco to Boulder to Slovenia. I was initially suspicious of a whiteboarding app that might whistle me back to the kind of horrid multi-day “planning offsite” navel-gazing exercises that I’ve come to dread, but we’ve found Miro to be awesome for working thru ideas with remote team members. And again, free. Amazing.</span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-b9h22"><span>That’s it, that’s what you need to start. Everything a SaaS startup needs to get up and running, for under $100 a month. </span></p><p id="viewer-61iv0"><span>--- </span></p><p id="viewer-8hurk"><span><strong>Epilogue</strong></span> </p><p id="viewer-dpf11"><span>As we’ve grown, there are other apps we’ve added or replaced. We needed a CI tool so we went with CircleCI. We eventually outgrew QBO for payroll once we added health insurance benefits and international payments so went to Rippling for that portion, still keeping QBO for everything else. We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month. It’s a great age to build a company with the wealth of inexpensive, amazing tools on the market.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

                    <p>India made over 1.3 billion UPI transactions last month. Spread over 150 banks and hundreds of mobile apps, every single UPI transaction followed the same identical flow—Apps asked for the same set of user inputs, showed the same screens, used a common PIN to authenticate and displayed the same messages. Which begs the question;</p><blockquote><strong>What if loan applications were like this too?</strong></blockquote><p>What if we could dramatically simplify loan applications to make them almost as simple as making a UPI payment? Imagine a world in which every loan application is simplified, standardised, and digitised, regardless of which lender you approached—no more chasing after bank statements <em>(don't forget to get it stamped!)</em>, no more signing every page of endless agreements <em>(in blue ink Saar, black ink not acceptable!)</em>, no more branch manager certificates, no more filling out half a dozen forms, or uploading your grandparents’ kundalis.</p><p>And for those less fortunate among us, no more implicit judgement of a loan application based on arbitrary social status indicators like dark skin, or a poorer grasp of English. When it comes to financial inclusion, human biases and prejudices often come in the way of access to credit to those who need it the most. </p><p>What if we had a standardised fully digital credit flow, powered by a uniform set of open APIs? And what if we used these APIs to make credit available via any and all apps borrowers use—the UPI payment app used by a vegetable seller, the delivery agent partner app used by a food delivery boy, or the accounting software used by an SME—all of them.</p><blockquote><strong>This is OCEN</strong>—the Open Credit Enablement Network. A single API with a uniform flow to power a billion loans for India.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

Today large lenders favour larger ticket size loans because they create enough unit margin to cover the costs of distribution, servicing, and collections. The unit-economics of sachet-sized loans can be improved through a digital paperless customer experience. By lowering CAC, op-ex, and collection costs, through digitisation, &nbsp;we can make a small ticket-size loan of around ₹10,000 with a repayment cycle of a few days viable for even the largest banks. </p><p>Further, India needs new ways of <em><strong>distributing</strong></em> these credit products at massive scale. Only deeply-embedded digital distribution at scale can make smaller and affordable credit products economically viable for lenders. We can achieve this by seamlessly embedding lending flows into the very activity the credit is funding:</p><p><em>Credit for fuel for a trucker should be available at the point and time of fuelling.</em></p><p><em>A kirana store needs credit offers at the time of placing orders with their distributor.</em></p><p><em>A B2B SME struggling to collect payments from corporates, needs invoice financing immediately after a completed delivery.</em></p><p>Enabling these flows requires us to move selling loans via generic DSAs, agents, and towards specialised originators that work and transact deeply with the end-borrower in specific business flows. These entities haven't distributed financial products historically and are unfamiliar with existing paper-based processes of lenders, and are unwilling to take them on. </p><p>For specialised origination to work, we need to remove the barriers between lenders and these new-age originators. With <a href="https://lsp-spec.setu.co/">OCEN APIs</a> loan applications will be simplified, standardised, and digitised thus making it easier for new types of distributors to integrate and work with multiple lenders. Thus extending their ability to reach, underwrite, and collect from a borrower anywhere in the country.</p><p>In effect, India needs a new class of loan products—both in terms of design and distribution—to meet the special needs of the trucker, the kirana store and the B2B manufacturer, and to enable specialised lenders to reach these borrowers.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg" alt="" width="5606" height="2035" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Setu's OCEN APIs</figcaption></figure><p>The OCEN APIs enable financial institutions to deliver their products to wherever their customers are. A standardised API between a lender and a mobile app provider means the kirana store can get and manage a loan entirely on a non-financial app like WhatsApp—no paperwork, no branch visits, and no phone calls. </p><blockquote>OCEN APIs are <strong>designed for easy plug and play by customer facing platforms and apps</strong>, with minimal integration efforts.</blockquote><p>The OCEN APIs thus create a common interface—like UPI—so that value-chain players who are close to an MSME and financial institutions which have a deep understanding of the MSME’s business can come together to create a new class of loan products.</p><p>At Setu, we have been keen students of OCEN since inception.

						<article id="post-4178">

                             
							<section itemprop="articleBody">

								<p><span>I cannot think of a better interlocutor than <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/">Chris Dilow</a>. He raises another set of interesting questions in his <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/07/ideas-interests-and-capital.html">reply</a> to my <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/angrynomics-a-reply-to-chris-dillow/">reply</a>. I am in danger of completely forgetting our original divergence of thought, but that bothers me not at all.</span></p>
<p><span>I have read a lot of Marx, and always want to read more. Marx is rightly regarded as the greatest social theorist. Marx was legendary synthesiser of thought. In this regard, <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/values-in-economics/">Habermas</a> – the <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/the-most-important-social-scientist-since-keynes/">greatest moral philosopher since Kant</a> – is his true heir. </span></p>
<p><span>Marx also created a framework of making sense of social change, organisation and power which is unrivalled in its completeness and coherence. In addition to his profound perceptiveness, this very coherence and completeness appeals in its own right. But I feel a different form of intellectual affinity with Marx. The coherence he attributes to social evolution is also the weakness in his framework. Marx, if you take his writing as a whole, knew this instinctively. There is a coherent theory of social evolution to be found in his writings, but there is also repeated arbitrary divergence from this theory and creative, chaotic asides that make his writing so absorbing. We can thank Marx for providing a theory of social change, a theoretical ‘ideal type’. It is a model that it almost always pertinent, but – perhaps always – incomplete, and often completely misleading.</span></p>
<p><span>A perspective I have long held about markets I partly attribute to Marx. It is actually an argument for the moral force of markets (not capitalism, per se, but certainly markets) – that free exchange is the antithesis of tribalism. The great French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, put it most succinctly: “In order to trade, we must first lay down our spear”. Marx, too, saw very clearly how global capitalism could be the enemy of tribal nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps intriguingly, I also want to bring Hayek in here. Hayek, Marx and Mauss view markets in ways which are far more instructive than that present in microeconomic textbooks. And here simplistic economic ideology has hindered understanding. So, one evolutionary function of markets is as a positive-sum method of conflict resolution. Everyone should be aware of this. If we perceive there to be a finite resource – say oil – let us use prices to determine who gets what, and incentivise the invention of substitutes. It’s better than the alternative. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek diverges from the standard micro-theory of markets by assuming imperfect information – quite rightly – and focussing on the role markets play in processing information. This too is profoundly insightful. In Hayek’s view, capital seeks informational advantages – this is a motivating force. If we already knew everything, we would do nothing. The pursuit of ‘excess return’ is the very lifeblood of innovative and dynamic capital. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek’s observations on the distribution of information are equally important. His critique of central planning significantly resides in the insight that the most important information is local to the individual and unobservable – it is in our heads. Only the individual knows what they want at any point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>As an aside, it is worth noting that Keynes, unsurprisingly, was the most astute psychologist in this cannon of thinkers on the motives of capital. He was totally open to the likelihood that many of the greatest investors – i.e. those that had the longest time-horizons and made the greatest contributions to human well-being – were motivated by nothing more than fascination at what could be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span>How does any of this bear on my discussion with Chris? My sense is that the motives and forms of capital at work in our societies are more diverse than at any point since the industrial revolution.  As Mark and I argue in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angrynomics-Eric-Lonergan/dp/1788212797/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?adgrpid=100757164789&amp;cv_ct_cx=angrynomics&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0_T4BRBlEiwAwoEiAWWpdQP-57O0aMprUkKmpjQbVHNLZX8R0CBQQI7Zar3_prk6eVgopBoCIKEQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=435785345402&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9045955&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=17321262343375037874&amp;hvtargid=kwd-884601278301&amp;hydadcr=24397_1816021&amp;keywords=angrynomics&amp;pd_rd_i=1788212797&amp;pd_rd_r=9a0d48ba-8492-4b48-b95c-ff635870897b&amp;pd_rd_w=RS60x&amp;pd_rd_wg=H99aG&amp;pf_rd_p=9b1a9511-9af9-4d06-8643-d54ebec511ef&amp;pf_rd_r=AP1416WT4M1BSGAJVPF5&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1595773559&amp;sr=1-1-fdbae751-0fa5-4c0f-900b-865654896618&amp;tag=googhydr-21">Angrynomics</a></em>, deregulation has set capital against capital, and asset price delusions add spice to this chaos. Myopic speculators finance blue-sky infinite-horizon destroyers of capital, such as Elon Musk – the world’s embodiment of a Keynesian investor.  Somewhat hilariously, a new form of elite social status – start-upism – is fantastically anti-capital, and its effects are super-charged by the secular collapse in the cost of semi-conductors. Despite its importance, none of this was predictable.</span></p>
<p><span>I struggle to see capital as the obstacle to progress in this world. If anything, a chaotic series of capitalist motivations – a collapse in the cost of debt to the state and a plethora of extraordinary technological innovations – have provided us with the very <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PM-Europe-roundtable.pdf">means to tackle our greatest challenges</a>. The failure of innovation is in public policy and democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads me in conclusion to more a ominous question. Hayek explained why China could not succeed. Central planning doesn’t work because the most important information is in our heads – only we know what we want to do. Really? Why has China progressed more rapidly and pervasively than any other major economy in AI, machine learning, fintech and social media. Because the contents of our minds is now available to the social planner. Is Marx about to have the last laugh?</span></p>

<p>I’ve been enjoying the ongoing <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/2020-workshop-information/">MIT STAMP workshop</a>. In particular, I’ve been enjoying listening to Nancy Leveson talk about system safety. Leveson is a giant in the safety research community (and, incidentally, an author of <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/nver-tse.pdf">my favorite software engineering study</a>). She’s also a critic of <em>root cause</em> and <em>human error</em> as explanations for accidents.  Despite this, she has a different perspective on safety than many in the resilience engineering community. To sharpen my thinking, I’m going to capture my understanding of this difference in this post below.</p>



<p>From Leveson’s perspective, <em>the engineering design should ensure that the system is safe</em>. More specifically, the design should contain <em>controls</em> that eliminate or mitigate <em>hazards</em>. In this view, accidents are invariably attributable to design errors: a hazard in the system was not effectively controlled in the design. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"The operator's job is to make up for the holes in the designer's work." – Jens Rasmussen (1981)</p>— John Allspaw (@allspaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw/status/225615911074267136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2012</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>By contrast, many in the resilience engineering community claim that <em>design alone cannot ensure that the system is safe.</em> The idea here is that the system design will always be incomplete, and the human operators must adapt their local work to make up for the gaps in the designed system. These adaptations usually contribute to safety, and sometimes contribute to incidents, and in post-incident investigations we often only notice the latter case.</p>



<p>These perspectives are quite different. Leveson believes that depending on human adaptation in the system is itself dangerous. If we’re depending on human adaptation to achieve system safety, then the design engineers have not done their jobs properly in controlling hazards. The resilience engineering folks believe that depending on human adaptation is <em>inevitable</em>, because of the messy nature of complex systems.</p>

<p>As demonstrated in the previous articles of this website, I've always been interested into running my own code on consumer devices.</p>
<p>In this series of two articles, we'll have a look at the well-known Google Home Mini.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we'll have to go rather deep into the rabbit hole. Various topics and techniques will be explored.</p>

</div>
</div>
<hr>

<p>First things first, let's start by a general overview of the Google Home Mini Hardware.</p>
<p>Cracking the case open reveal the following PCB. Important components are all annotated. Some RF shields have been removed to expose the components.</p>
<p><a href="#" id="gmini-openseadragon-top-button">Top Side</a> - <a href="#" id="gmini-openseadragon-bottom-button">Bottom Side</a>
</p>


<p>
       The main Google Home Mini MPU. It's a ARM-based SoC manufactured by Marvell and branded as "ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus".
    </p>
<p>
       A TC58NVG1S3HBAI6 256 MB NAND Flash. It contains the entire firmware of the Google Home Mini
    </p>
<p>
       This push button is not accessible without cracking the case open. Pushing it at boot time will force the bootloader to boot from the USB port of the device. However, only signed code can theoretically be executed.
    </p>
<p>
       One of the two MEMS microphone of the device. The acoustic hole is on the other side of the PCB.

    </p>
<p>
       The main speaker of the Google Home can be plugged to this two pins connector.
    </p>
<p>
       A LED Driver. It communicates with the MPU via an i2c bus.
    </p>
<p>
       An audio CODEC, driving the main speaker. It communicates with the MPU via i2c and I2S buses.
    </p>
<p>
       A DDR memory, used by the main processor.
    </p>
<p>
       A WLAN/BT module, manufactured by Marvell.
    </p>
<p>
       A mechanical switch, used to disable and enable the microphones.
    </p>
<p>
       A micro USB port. It provides power to the entire system. Data lines are also routed to the main processor.
    </p>
<p><em>Quick side note: So far, I have opened two Google Home Mini. On these two units, the NAND Flash component used isn't the same. However, to keep things simple, this article will expect a <code>TC58NVG1S3HBAI6</code> flash is used all along.</em></p>
<p>Most components are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> components. It makes reverse-engineering the system harder: difficult for instance to probe individual signals between two integrated circuits. Further, reliably reworking the board (i.e. desoldering and soldering back a component) requires quite some skills.</p>
<p>I didn't find any active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a> interface during my research. Same goes for debug <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> test points.</p>
<p>Finally, it's important to note that the main CPU comes without public documentation. Very few details about this component are available online. All the juicy technical data is likely protected by a <em>NDA</em>.</p>
<p>To conclude, at first sight, the hardware looks rather annoying to work with and doesn't appear to be very <em>talkative</em>.</p>

<p>As you might expect, I'm not the only one who has been studying the Google Home devices. Here is a quick summary of what others have discovered at the time of writing of this article.</p>
<h2 id="chromecast vulnerabilities">Chromecast Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The hardware and software of the Google Home Mini is very close to what is embedded into Google Chromecast devices. Hence, it's interesting to have a look at what have been discovered against this product.  </p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> was able to root Chromecast devices with a vulnerability affecting the bootloader. A buffer overflow vulnerability triggered thanks to a special USB peripheral led to a full secure boot bypass. The vulnerability is detailed <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt1/">here</a> and <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt2/">there</a>.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has now been patched and the Google Home family was never affected by the issue.</p>
<p>However, the work from <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> has two interesting takeaways for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many eyes already had a look at the bootloader. It's reducing the likelihood I can still discover something to exploit in it to bypass the secure boot on a Google Home Mini.</li>
<li>The articles highlight that Google has released the source code for the bootloader and Linux Kernel running on the Chromecast. Same goes for the Google Home family. Everything is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0B3j4zj2IQp7MZkplRzRvcERtaU0">here</a>. This source code will be extremely useful in the second article of this series.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="defcon27 presentation">DEFCON27 Presentation</h2>
<p>Another very important piece of information is the presentation given during <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/">DEFCON27</a> untitled <em>"Breaking Google Home: Exploit It with SQLite(Magellan)"</em>. The slides are available <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Wenxiang-Qian-Yuxiang-Li-Huiyu-Wu-Breaking-Google-Home-Exploit-It-with-SQLite-Magellan.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the presentation, an attack affecting the userspace software of the Google Home is detailed. This led to the result I want to achieve: code execution on the Google Home.</p>
<p>While extremely informative, the attack described by the presentation cannot be used against my own device anymore. The bugs have all been patched already.</p>
<p>However, the presentation contains an interesting slide that summarizes quite well what the attack surface of the Google Home Mini is.</p>
<div>

<p><img src="https://courk.cc/running-custom-code-google-home-mini-part1/assets/google_mini_attack_surface.png"></p><p>The Google Home Mini attack surface</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> work is shown, as well as possible network attacks that are explored in the presentation.</p>
<p>What's left is to research vulnerabilities on the WiFi/BLE module of the device or to modify the firmware stored in the NAND Flash of the device.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my own goal">My Own Goal</h2>
<p>These studies make very clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Google Home Mini is protected by some kind of secure boot. Bootloader and Kernel are cryptographically verified.</li>
<li>Many interesting attack vectors have already been explored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering this, I chose to go the the <em>NAND Flash way</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My goal will be to modify the NAND flash content until I can execute my own code.</strong></p>
<p><em>"What's the point?"</em> you might ask. Well, here are a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's the most direct way of achieving code execution on the platform.</li>
<li>Dynamic analysis of the Goggle Home software <strong>running on the actual hardware</strong> becomes possible.</li>
<li>Similarly, it may be useful to explore the WiFi/BT module attack vector.</li>
<li>As explained before, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip">SoC</a> of the Google Home Mini comes without any public documentation. Being able to run custom code on it is valuable to understand it better. Things like dumping the <em>BootROM</em> of the system becomes possible.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it's an interesting challenge that will need me to go down the rabbit hole. The content and structure of the NAND Flash will need to be understood. A exploit could be needed to bypass the secure boot.</li>
</ul>
<p>This path may sound like the easiest way to go to achieve code execution, but an important challenge will first need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I explained in the previous section, the hardware design of the Google Home Mini is not <em>"rework friendly"</em> at all.</p>
<p>The NAND Flash is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> component. Desoldering and soldering it back is easier said than done, especially considering I'll likely have to do it multiple times. Some little tricks will need to be used.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="general concept idea">General Concept Idea</h2>
<p>Repeatedly desoldering and soldering back the NAND Flash would have been annoying and could have caused damage to to the PCB.</p>
<p>Manually soldering thin wires to the BGA footprint for breaking out the NAND Flash lines could have been risky because of signal integrity issues. It wouldn't have been a very clean and, more importantly, reliable solution.</p>
<p>Hence, to overcome this burden, I developed <em>NandBug</em>.</p>
<p><em>NandBug</em> is composed of three boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Interposer Board</em> that's soldered to the Google Home Mini PCB, right at the NAND Flash location. This board breaks out the NAND Flash signals to a tiny connector.</li>
<li>The <em>Main Board</em>, that can be connected to both the <em>Interposer Board</em> and <em>Daughter Board</em>. It can communicate with a computer through a USB interface.</li>
<li>The <em>Daughter Board</em>. The delicate BGA NAND Flash IC is soldered to this board.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general concept of <em>NandBug</em> is described by the following diagram.</p>

</div>
<p>In a word, thanks to this system, the NAND Flash IC can be accessed from both the Google Home circuit and the electronic of the <em>Main Board</em>.</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>The general idea is in fact to make the NAND Flash of the Google Home <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming">in-system programmable</a>. It may sound like an over engineered solution and it maybe is. But, hey, I'm doing this project for fun anyway.</p>

<div>
<p>Our vision of the smart home today is a series of disaggregated interactions with smart devices that control the domestic flow of a household, from controlling light ambience and temperature control to front door security. However, Big Tech’s move into the smart home space is reflective of a vastly different approach. Consumer-focused Big Tech, Google Amazon and Apple are interested in the smart home as an extension of the consumer’s interaction with the digital world – where their core propositions lie. Currently, a consumer’s interactions with Big Tech’s core propositions whether it is search, commerce or software is through the mobile or the desktop. An individual in the privacy and the comfort of the home represents an opportunity to create a touchpoint that transcends both the desktop and the mobile. However, a disaggregated bundle of smart devices, while utility-driven, don’t tap into the full potential of a truly high tech smart home ‘experience’. So what is the lucrative future big tech is chasing in consumer homes?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across all three consumer tech companies, their approach to reach the consumer within their home has been through the combination of an AI assistant paired with a smart speaker, a voice portal to the digital world. In thinking about transcending interactions beyond mobile or desktop, voice-based interactions are an almost natural evolution. Voice is both intuitive and hands-free and eminently suited to the quiet and privacy of the home. For this reason, dominating voice-based interactions has become the front line in the battle for a lead on smart homes. While the market is currently segregated largely between Amazon’s Alexa/Echo and Google’s Assistant/Home, Apple has made a tentative first step with the Apple Pod. The real motivator is to become the gatekeeper of our digital interactions in the home insofar as they evolve beyond the mobile and the desktop.</p>



<h3>The voice portal: a defensive and offensive strategy</h3>



<p>For Big Tech the voice portal represents two-fold value. The first it helps to bulwark their existing core propositions from erosion. For example, Google dominates search and will want to ensure that it retains that dominance even as search evolves to include voice-based search. Similarly Google and Apple’s role as gatekeepers of software through the Android and iOS app stores and Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce benefit similarly by capturing and dominating any evolution of these propositions through voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second is the more important value to pursue. It is that the voice portal and all of its interactions represent an opportunity to create new and fertile fields for Big Tech to laterally expand its core proposition. The closest representations of this lateral expansion is perhaps the app store. The mobile app store acted as the gateway to the consumer’s experience of the mobile phone. Similarly, when wearables became mainstream, smartwatch specific app stores focused on leveraging the smart watch’s specific mode of interaction determined the consumer’s experience of wearables. In a similar vein, the AI assistant and speaker combination acts as the app store equivalent for voice specific interactions. Just as existing digital services built for the mobile and the smartwatch, they will build for voice-based interactions by integrating with voice-enabled AI assistants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Smart home devices versus a smart home experience&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When we’re talking about smart home devices, it can range from a thermostat to a smart fridge – many of the use cases will require specific hardware that results in some type of discrete action. A smart home experience, on the other hand, would require an underlying cohesion that held the home ecosystem together and enhanced the resident’s life – this extends beyond isolated devices that perform isolated functions. We can think of the voice portal as the underlying system that provides cohesion for the smart home, needing to deliver an experience as robust and desirable as the digital experience currently available to us through phones and computers. When users feel notifications on their phone are equal in value to the notifications on their smart speaker, that’s when the portal really opens up to allow for immense value capture. This kind of potential is then able to be channelled profitably through killer applications catered to the voice portal. But let’s take a deeper look at why the experience, as opposed to discrete function, lends itself to greater adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the voice portal to become accessible to a broad audience, users have to be convinced of the added value in the experience of voice interactions. But in order to do this the voice portal will need applications that demonstrate value-add in a meaningful way – where the convenience and experience outweigh the cognitive expense of the transition to voice. To understand this, we can break down the tiers of voice interaction. While the more complex interactions bear a higher cognitive burden they are also the most lucrative opportunities to create an experience rather than an isolated function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tier 1: Routine one-way interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong>&nbsp; smart device feeds you information based on preset prompts – e.g. Lights turn on at a certain hour, reads the weather every morning etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>little to no cognitive expense on the part of the consumer</p>



<p>Tier 2: Two-way interaction:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to the device spontaneously and the device reacts – e.g. set an alarm, meeting reminder etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device to execute on commands</p>



<p>Tier 3: Consumer interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> purchases through the voice device – e.g. order groceries, pay bills etc</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device with the financial element of the consumers life</p>



<p>Tier 4: Push to public interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to platforms on the internet that will be visible to others&nbsp; – e.g. interact with social media through voice dictation&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden:</strong> cognitive expense of trusting the device to signal appropriately to the public, the consumer’s self and reputation</p>



<p>When thinking about the first three types of interaction&nbsp; (one way, two way and consumer) it becomes clear that the original experience remains largely unchanged except for the added convenience of not needing to pick up a device and do it manually. For example, using voice control to turn on the lights, set an alarm, order groceries etc. But ‘push to public interactions’ exhibit characteristics that enhance the existing experience of activities like social media interaction. For example, Facebook might allow for important notifications, status updates, voice dictation for posts etc. More importantly, it could give notifications on social signalling, such as number of likes, comments and other elements that the user would associate with their social capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way the digital social experience becomes a natural extension of the user’s home life, providing a more plugged in, socially intuitive voice experience that reflects traditional social interactions – the current digital experience of social media is static in the sense that it only exists when the user taps into it. The voice portal would allow users with a preference for it, to integrate their digital and physical social experience in a more seamless way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience-based functions are superior in being able to deliver additional value capture because they increase touchpoints for existing services while enhancing the experience of those services. ‘User based services’ are then probably best positioned to be the killer applications for voice portals, much like they are for the browser and mobile today. While smart devices and discrete functions are definitely useful, their value add remains scattered without the cohesion of voice enhanced experiences. It then becomes clear why Big Tech is in a race to dominate the home, as they become the gatekeepers to all the value that funnels through the voice portal as users make that transition.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. The execution of voice as a human-centric user interface will determine the adoption of voice-based technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>“Interfaces to digital systems of the future will no longer be machine-driven. They will be human-centric,” explains Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer, “We can build human natural interfaces to digital systems and with that, a whole environment will become active.”</p>



<p>“VUI [Voice-user interface] allows for hands-free, efficient interactions that are more ‘human’ in nature than any other form of user interface. “Speech is the fundamental means of human communication,” writes Clifford Nass, Stanford researcher and co-author of Wired for Speech, “…all cultures persuade, inform and build relationships primarily through speech.” In order to create VUI systems that work, developers need to fully understand the intricacies of human communication.”</p>



<p>The benefits of voice as a mode of interaction above traditional user interfaces encompasses the ability to create efficiency and convenience (hands-free), design a more human experience and imbue personality and tone to interactions creating greater brand affinity.</p>



<p>“Google Home is totally au fait with pop culture references, from Star Trek to Sir Mix A Lot, as is Amazon’s Alexa. A more personable tone helps users to forgive those moments when virtual assistants are unable to complete tasks or answer questions that an actual human would have no problem with.”</p>



<p>There are however multiple roadblocks to an immersive and coherent implementation of voice-based technologies.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>After working at Google for four years after college, I’ve now been at
<a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> for a bit under a year. People often ask - how does
it compare?</p>

<h2 id="what-i-miss">What I miss</h2>

<h3 id="the-developer-tools">The developer tools</h3>
<p>Google’s internal developer tools are really nice - here’s a few things I
find myself missing or dealing with worse versions on a day to day basis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flume (<a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a>, sort of): The internal
tooling around building large scale batch compute pipelines is top notch,
and I didn’t appreciate it nearly enough at the time!</li>
  <li>Critique: The internal code review site. Nicely integrated with other tools
and the turn-taking philosophy and CL Monitor chrome extension were top
notch.</li>
  <li>BUILD files and Blaze aka <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>: I encounter more
mysteriously broken builds or build processes in a few weeks now than I did
in years at Google. (A couple of my friends missed it enough to start a
company, <a href="https://buildbuddy.io/">BuildBuddy</a>, around it)</li>
  <li>Codesearch: Sourcegraph just doesn’t cut it - I think the tighter
integration really benefits Codesearch (“Find References” basically always

<h3 id="the-401k">The 401k</h3>
<p>Google has one of the rare 401k plans that allows for the <a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/the-mega-backdoor-roth-ira/">“mega backdoor
401k”</a>, which
allow you to contribute after-tax dollars up to the $57,000 limit and convert
them to a Roth 401k. With the 50% match on the normal set of contributions,
you’d end up with <code>$19,500 * 150% = $29,250</code> in traditional pre-tax
contributions and <code>$57,000 - $29,250 = $27,750</code> in converted Roth contributions
per calendar year! It’s a really great way to put money away quickly and it’s
feasible on high L3 (new grad) or L4 (one level up) Bay Area engineer

<h3 id="memegen">Memegen</h3>
<p>Memegen is Google’s internal meme site and cultural icon; at its best it’s a
wonderful, hilarious place. (At its worst, not so much… read on)</p>

<h3 id="the-people">The people</h3>
<p>Maybe a little cliché, but I worked with a lot of great people at Google on
<a href="https://fi.google.com/">Fi</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/329395083">Tailor</a> (RIP) and
it’s sad to not be working with them any more!</p>

<h2 id="whats-good-out-in-the-real-world">What’s good out in the “real world”</h2>
<p>The above is actually not that long of a list.</p>

<h3 id="working-harder">Working harder</h3>
<p>I’ve enjoyed working at a place that’s generally a hungrier for success.  This
doesn’t mean working crazy hours, but it does mean making the ones you do work
count, and at this point in my career I’m not ready to rest-and-vest. (I
actually literally did that at Google for three months after my last team got
shut down, and hated it - but that’s a story for another time.)</p>

<h3 id="working-on-trying-to-make-money">Working on trying to make money</h3>
<p>This is maybe a weird comment to make about an extraordinarily profitable
company- but large parts of the Google engineering workforce are pretty far
removed from the actual business of making money, leading to some classic
issues like favoring new projects that’ll get you promoted. It’s refreshing to
get back to focusing on business success instead of fuzzier metrics.</p>

<h3 id="learning-transferable-tech">Learning transferable tech</h3>
<p>I’ve been pretty happy to expand my skillset to use a bunch of different AWS
tools (S3, EC2, Kinesis, Aurora, Elasticsearch) and others (Kubernetes) that’ll
be relevant at other companies; Google’s stack was good but I sometimes
got the feeling that I was over-specializing.</p>

<h3 id="no-memegen">No Memegen</h3>
<p>Memegen, especially post-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber">Damore
manifesto</a>,
became less of a fun way to poke fun at fancy lunches and instead became a
battleground. Ultimately it resulted in more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html">employee organizing and
advocacy for important
issues</a>,
which was good, but mentally it made it tougher to justify staying. 
(Rightly so! But my early 2010s halcyon vision of Google had been broken.)</p>

<h3 id="the-people-1">The people</h3>
<p>Turns out I get to work with a lot of great people at <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> too!</p>

    <p>Large projects and mono repos can be a pain to navigate. <strong>gg</strong>
is a small script I use almost everyday to make it easier.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever worked with WordPress —&nbsp;or really most CMSes for
that matter — the base application configuration, themes,
plugins, etc. are typically given their own sub directories to
help isolate them. For WordPress development, I use the
<a href="https://roots.io/">Roots</a> stack and it does a great job of
making the project structure relavant, however, since it is
still WordPress, the project structure is not exactly flat.
Often I’ll need to jump to Trellis’ directory to start the
development VM, run a deploy, or update an environment’s
configuration, but shortly after jump back to the directory of
the theme or plugin I’m working on. Remembering the level of
depth and simply writing out the path can be a tedious and
erroneous task.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-solution">A simple solution</h2>
<p><strong>gg</strong> is a very simple Bash script I wrote to make is 100%
easier to jump between directories in a large project. Here’s a
short clip of it in action with a Roots project:</p>

<p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0SjUNTfzKk" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
    </iframe>
</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-the-script">Breaking down the script</h2>
<p>There are a few requirements you will need before you get started:</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: <code>git</code>, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"><code>ag</code></a></p>
<p>You most likely should be able to achieve the same thing with
built-in tools or alternatives to <code>fd</code> and <code>ag</code> (maybe even
<code>fzf</code>), but for this tutorial, I’ll use the tools listed above.
One note before diving into the script, I do have the following
set for my FZF default command:</p>
<pre><span>export </span><span>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</span><span>='</span><span>ag -g ""</span><span>'
</span></pre>
<p>The script itself is pretty simple. There are two parts to it.
First, if we want to see all of the directories within our
project, even if we are already in a nested directory, we will
need to jump to the root of the Git repo. Luckily, it is
relatively easy to do this with Git. Using Git’s <code>rev-parse</code>
subcommand with the <code>--show-toplevel</code> flag, we can get “the
absolute path of the top-level-directory.” Since this is useful
in itself, but still a tad cumbersome to remember and write out,
we’ll create a function for it:</p>
<pre><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>If you already have a set of Git-aliases, you might find naming
conflicts with the ones I will create in this tutorial and in
that case, or in the case you don’t like the names I’ve picked,
you will need to use a different name.</p>
<p>The next step is to create an easy way to find a sub-directory.
If you’ve ever used a fuzzy-search tool, you’ll know that that
they are pretty great. Knowing the fuzzy-search capabilities of
<code>fzf</code>, I know I can do something like <code>cd $(fzf)</code> to almost
achieve what we’re looking for, however, that finds directories
and files, the latter of which we do not need. Luckily, we can
use a finder tool with <code>fzf</code> to get what we need. I’ll use <code>fd</code>
to achieve this:</p>
<pre><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>We are telling <code>fd</code> to just find directories, follow symbolic
links, allow hidden directories, but exclude the <code>.git</code>
directory. Luckily, <code>fd</code> already respects <code>.gitignore</code> so we do
not need to worry about dependencies or build files polluting
our search selection. Also, we are making it fancy with a
preview window of the selected directory’s contents.</p>
<p>I prefer to leave these as separate functions in case I want to
just jump to the Git repo root or jump to a sub-directoy within
the current directory. For the final <code>gg</code> command, we can just
use an alias:</p>
<pre><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>
<p>And that’s it. Here’s the full and final script:</p>
<pre><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to Git root
</span><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to sub-directory
</span><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to a directory within the current Git repository
</span><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p>Early on at Compression.ai, our main image compression algorithm used to look a lot more like most other Machine Learning (ML) based image compression algorithms — an auto-encoder. We had a branched neural network as the encoder, a branched neural network as the decoder, and an entropy coding module sandwiched in the middle. We then trained this whole network using the 1M ImageNet dataset, which contain just over 1 million images.</p>
<p>It was super simple. And it worked! Our model compressed images at 0.8 bit-per-pixel (bpp), while keeping the MS-SSIM over 0.99. Comparing against all the published work at the time, we were at the top in terms of visual quality to compression ratio. It was great, and we thought we had something.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*SlUT3YbVlYw0N6HF" alt="A typical auto-encoder" width="337" height="226"></p><p>Figure 1: A typical auto-encoder</p>
</div>
<p>But trying to get people to adapt a new file format was way harder than we originally thought, it was nearly impossible. No one wants to download a codec (that handles decompression) to open their images, even if it’s anything open source – let alone a proprietary one. We figured this out early on, and knew that if we were to make something substantial in the compression space, it had to be about taking an existing standard and improving on it, rather than creating a completely new one.</p>
<p>JPEG, first introduced to the world almost 3 decades ago, is still the most widely used image compression standard in the world. It is surprisingly simple, yet extremely effective. We figured if we needed to create something for the masses, it needed to be JPEG. This is when we began our work in improving JPEG with ML. In this blog post, I’ll detail the process we took, and how we ultimately created the best image compression algorithm there is.</p>
<h2>Enter JPEG</h2>
<p>To really understand how we can bring ML to JPEG, we’d need to start with JPEG itself and understand how JPEG compresses images. For a given image, the following explains how the JPEG algorithm works:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the image is broken in to 8×8, non-overlapping blocks</li>
<li>Then for each 8×8 block, the algorithm:
<ul>
<li>Converts the color space to YUV</li>
<li>Performs subsampling on the UV channels (In case for 4:2:0 for example)</li>
<li>Applies the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</li>
<li>Quantizes using a Q-Table</li>
<li>Entropy codes to obtain a bit string</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lastly, this bit string (each per block of 8×8), together with metadata (such as the Q-Table) comprises the JPEG file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The JPEG decoder, on the other hand, performs the above in reverse to reconstruct the image. If we take the output after quantization, perform de-quantization (basically by multiplying element-wise with the Q-Table) followed by an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), and convert the color space back to RGB, then we end up with 8×8 blocks of the original image. To go into more depth into how the JPEG compression works, refer to the following articles:</p>

<h2>Enter Machine Learning</h2>
<p>So how do we go about improving this process with Machine Learning? When you take a step back, you realize that the above computational steps can be executed in tensor-flowy fashion.&nbsp; Take an image, say of dimensions (a, b, 3), and create 8×8 patches of it (N, 8, 8, 3), N being the number of patches. (It helps if the image dimensions are divisible by 8, otherwise zero-padding would do. Anyway, details don’t matter much here, let’s focus image flow for now).&nbsp; On each 8×8 patch, we apply DCT, followed by a quantization step. A dequantization step&nbsp; followed by IDCT will yield back the original color space.</p>
<p>Now, if we had trainable parameters, we can imagine this process as a flow of a tensor, and use a framework like TensorFlow to code the model. You can then start training it with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and optimize the network for MS-SSIM, for example.</p>
<p>Quantization in the JPEG algorithm consists of two operations. The first is to divide the numbers element-wise using a table commonly referred to as a Q-Table. This division is then followed by rounding to the nearest integer (to convert from floating-point numbers after DCT to integers in order to save space).</p>
<p>What we realized was, all the meaningful compression in the JPEG algorithm happens at this Quantization step – it is when the output of the DCT gets divided by the Q-Table. If we then use a neural network to approximate the best Q-Table possible, while guaranteeing a minimum MS-SSIM score, we have a winner.</p>
<p>Compression.ai’s newest JPEG compression engine was built using this concept. At its heart, we have a neural network outputting the best Q-Table guaranteeing the smallest output files size for the highest MS-SSIM score, tailored for each and every input image. A super fast implementation of the traditional JPEG compression algorithm is then used to create the final output image file.</p>
<p>So there you go. There’s a peak into the machine learning side of our algorithms.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>

<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>

    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>

<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>

<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>

<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

Over the past decade, the field has experienced staggering growth, at a rate of more than 20% per year, printing pieces that range from aircraft components and car parts to medical and dental implants out of metals and engineering polymers. One of the most widely used manufacturing processes, selective laser sintering (SLS), prints parts out of micron-scale material powders using a laser: the laser heats the particles to the point where they fuse together to form a solid mass.</p><p>“Additive manufacturing is key to economic resilience,” say <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.columbia.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fhod-lipson&amp;t=ZjcyNGQ4MzYxYjA0NDNlMGY3M2U0YzcyYzkxZWUzNjY3MjYwZTI1MyxSZUtKazNaTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624923909627805696%2Flaser-inversion-3d-printing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596255553">Hod Lipson</a>, James and Sally Scapa Professor of Innovation (<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fme.columbia.edu%2F&amp;t=NDQzODBiODVhNTEyNDQzNTllNzc1MTRiOGIyZDE0ZDJkYWVlNTM4NCxSZUtKazNaTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624923909627805696%2Flaser-inversion-3d-printing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596255553">Mechanical Engineering</a>). “All of us care about this technology—it’s going to save us. But there’s a catch.”</p><p>The catch is that SLS technologies have been limited to printing with a single material at a time: the entire part has to be made of just that one powder. “Now, let me ask you,” Lipson continues, “how many products are made of just one material? The limitations of printing in only one material has been haunting the industry and blocking its expansion, preventing it from reaching its full potential.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Wondering how to solve this challenge, Lipson and his PhD student John Whitehead used their expertise in robotics to develop a new approach to overcome these SLS limitations. By inverting the laser so that it points upwards, they invented a way to enable SLS to use—at the same time—multiple materials. Their working prototype, along with a print sample that contained two different materials in the same layer, was <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.addma.2020.101440&amp;t=MTZmOGI1OWQ5NjA1NDVjNmE0MjM1ZWVkNWY1YjFiN2NlYTNhZTk1NixSZUtKazNaTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624923909627805696%2Flaser-inversion-3d-printing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596255553">recently published online</a> by <i>Additive Manufacturing</i> as part of its December 2020 issue.</p><p>“Our initial results are exciting,” says Whitehead, the study’s lead author, “because they hint at a future where any part can be fabricated at the press of a button, where objects ranging from simple tools to more complex systems like robots can be removed from a printer fully formed, without the need for assembly.”</p><p>Selective laser sintering traditionally has involved fusing together material particles using a laser pointing downward into a heated print bed. A solid object is built from the bottom up, with the printer placing down a uniform layer of powder and using the laser to selectively fuse some material in the layer. The printer then deposits a second layer of powder onto the first layer, the laser fuses new material to the material in the previous layer, and the process is repeated over and over until the part is completed.</p><p>This process works well if there is just one material used in the printing process. But using multiple materials in a single print has been very challenging, because once the powder layer is deposited onto the bed, it cannot be unplaced, or replaced with a different powder.</p><p>“Also,” adds Whitehead, “in a standard printer, because each of the successive layers placed down are homogeneous, the unfused material obscures your view of the object being printed, until you remove the finished part at the end of the cycle. Think about excavation and how you can’t be sure the fossil is intact until you completely remove it from the surrounding dirt. This means that a print failure won’t necessarily be found until the print is completed, wasting time and money.”</p><p>The researchers decided to find a way to eliminate the need for a powder bed entirely. They set up multiple transparent glass plates, each coated with a thin layer of a different plastic powder. They lowered a print platform onto the upper surface of one of the powders, and directed a laser beam up from below the plate and through the plate’s bottom. This process selectively sinters some powder onto the print platform in a pre-programmed pattern according to a virtual blueprint. The platform is then raised with the fused material, and moved to another plate, coated with a different powder, where the process is repeated. This allows multiple materials to either be incorporated into a single layer, or stacked. Meanwhile, the old, used-up plate is replenished.</p><p>In the paper, the team demonstrated their working prototype by generating a 50 layer thick, 2.18mm sample out of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) powder with an average layer height of 43.6 microns and a multi-material nylon and TPU print with an average layer height of 71 microns. These parts demonstrated both the feasibility of the process and the capability to make stronger, denser materials by pressing the plate hard against the hanging part while sintering.</p><p>“This technology has the potential to print embedded circuits, electromechanical components, and even robot components. It could make machine parts with graded alloys, whose material composition changes gradually from end to end, such as a turbine blade with one material used for the core and different material used for the surface coatings,” Lipson notes. “We think this will expand laser sintering towards a wider variety of industries by enabling the fabrication of complex multi-material parts without assembly. In other words, this could be key to moving the additive manufacturing industry from printing only passive uniform parts, towards printing active integrated systems.”</p><p>The researchers are now experimenting with metallic powders and resins in order to directly generate parts with a wider range of mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties than is possible with conventional SLS systems today.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;Laser beam transmitting upwards through glass.

                <section>
                    <p>Aaron Tilley of the Wall Street Journal has an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-pandemic-forces-businesses-to-confront-cloud-computing-costs-11595849519">interesting piece</a> (paywalled) today that speaks to one of the challenges that businesses are facing on the pandemic related technology front. The net of it is that companies are spending more and more on cloud costs, sometimes independent of their business outcomes. It doesn't compute long term. <br></p><p>More importantly, we think this moment signals a shift, with the pendulum swinging in the direction of the private cloud. The direction of repatriation. &nbsp;<br></p><p>We are not suggesting that the public cloud is a phenomenon. On the contrary, it has established itself as one of the foundational components of the enterprise technology stack. It is a multi-billion dollar business for nearly a dozen companies, led most famously by the exceptionally talented and driven team at Amazon. Their web services business generates $40 billion per year, and while the S3 business represents the lion’s share of the revenue, there are valuable services that continue to proliferate, reducing AWS’s exposure to that line of business.</p><p>Why did the cloud become so ubiquitous so quickly?</p><ol><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> – AWS and others made it simple to solve problems. Need compute? Done. Need storage? Done. Want to add to that storage? Done. Want to analyze the data inside that storage? Done. The public cloud dramatically reduced the friction associated with cloud and shifted the balance of power to the developer community and away from IT.</li><li><strong>Elasticity</strong> – The public cloud offered a novel model: pay for what you need, when you need it. The concept of spinning up storage and compute and then spinning it down was entirely new and offered an attractive alternative to sunk costs and over-provisioning.</li><li><strong>A Microservices Mentality</strong> – One of the least appreciated implications of the cloud is that it came ready with an unbelievably rich catalog of applications, services and APIs that dramatically accelerated the development of data rich applications.</li></ol><p>While these themes powered the rise of the public cloud, they are not fundamentally competitive differentiators. That is to say, that the same attributes can be replicated on other public cloud options and more notably the private cloud, with a number of other benefits. Specifically, on the private cloud you get:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Security</strong> – While the public cloud offers an increasing array of security options, it suffers from some key gaps, namely complexity and management.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> – As we have noted in many of our <a href="https://blog.min.io/tag/benchmarks/">benchmark papers</a>, the public cloud is plenty fast. Object storage is the primary storage platform in the public cloud for a reason: it offers superior throughput, albeit higher latency. For data-rich applications and analytics, this is the ideal tradeoff. In the private cloud, proximity comes into play and delivers better performance than the public cloud at a fraction of the cost. This is a function of how expensive bandwidth is compared to storage.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong> – Ultimately, the public cloud, for all its benefits, doesn’t deliver cost saving at scale. This is what is driving the <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3532030/cloud-repatriation-rescues-cios-from-mounting-costs.html">repatriation phenomenon</a> for large enterprises and keeping other ones <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-americas-350-million-internal-cloud-bet-striking-payoff-2019-10?IR=T">out of the cloud.</a> The ease of spinning up an instance, coupled with the ease of forgetting about it, results in massive bills. If your enterprise is dealing with petabytes the economics favor the private cloud.</li></ol><p>Having said that there are some good reasons a company <em><strong>should</strong></em> move the public cloud. The answer is to learn. To develop cloud-native muscle. To change the DNA of your organization.</p><p>Once you have achieved that, you come back to the private cloud – to run your business at scale. Let’s explore that concept a little further:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Out of Your Comfort Zone</strong> – There are a number of skills you will never learn from sliding another blade into the rack and seeing it come up on your “single pane of glass”. This is not an insult to IT admins, as they have significant amounts of tribal knowledge that are immensely valuable. Further, the success of the blade vendors is predicated on making things simple. None of those blade vendors want to talk about Kubernetes, containers or programming skills or databases - but those are the components of the public cloud and they have to be mastered. What better place to do it than the cloud, where sampling different software solutions is as easy as cruising the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Cloud-Native Muscle</strong> – The cloud-native mentality is fundamentally different from the traditional IT mentality. The traditional IT mentality is about hardware appliances, integration testing, validation and labs. The cloud-native mentality is about software, applications, containerization, orchestration, APIs and microservices. The cloud-native way is to rapidly assemble infrastructure, applications and workflows, and then deploy that in the service of a business problem. The cloud-native way is the future. Kubernetes is the dominant model in the build/package/deploy framework. It was designed for the cloud-native world that we now live in. These are the skills that a modern enterprise needs to develop. Learning them in the traditional IT framework makes no sense. Moving to the cloud demands that the organization master the cloud-native skill set because that is the only skill set that works there.</li><li><strong>Understand Scaling</strong> – In the public cloud, simple scales, failure domains are kept small and building blocks represent the way things are built. Massive, monolithic systems don’t exist. Massive systems exist, just ask the CIOs with 8-figure AWS bills, but they are composed of smaller blocks. The basic premise of cloud-native architecture, whether it is for compute or storage, is to consume resources in small, discrete chunks. As you scale, you add additional instances and pack them as densely as possible in your infrastructure instead of scaling one instance up infinitely.</li><li><strong>Internalize Simplicity</strong> – One of the great gifts of the cloud is simplicity: the ability to <a href="https://min.io/pricing">start with a credit card</a>, to provision infrastructure with a click of the mouse, to add products and services. Simple wins in the cloud. For too long, IT used complexity as a method of control. Only certain, credentialed and certified individuals were given the keys to the castle. In the cloud, simple wins. If your app or service is simple to provision and deploy, more people will adopt it. Like water, consumers choose the path of least resistance. Simple does not mean lacking in features or power. Simple is often more powerful than complex – it just takes more effort to deliver the experience. Simplicity democratizes data. Every organization wants to democratize data – they need to learn its secrets and apply them at scale.</li></ul><p>Good? Now apply at scale.<br></p><p>As noted, the public cloud is an amazing place to learn but not an amazing place to scale – unless of course, you are the landlord (AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba). The place to scale is on the private cloud, using the same technologies that you used on the public cloud: S3 storage, dense compute, high-speed networking, Kubernetes, containers and microservices. <br></p><p>This offers the ideal mix of operational costs, flexibility and control. It is true that you will take on CapEx, but by starting small and taking advantage of key cloud lessons (elasticity and scaling by components) enterprises can minimize the initial outlay and maximize the operationational savings.<br></p><p>The net effect is to drive superior TCO and ROI through the private cloud. <br></p><p>So go to the public cloud and learn the “way of the cloud” then apply it on-prem. That is where the economics, control and security reign supreme. <br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've wanted to join YC for the last 8 years. I've applied to and been rejected by YC three times.</p><p>But when we got into YC with <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a>, we turned it down. Here’s why…</p><h2 id="yc-as-an-employee">YC as an Employee</h2><p>I first learned about YC in 2012 from <a href="https://twitter.com/zebulgar">a friend</a> who was obsessed with startups. Soon, all of my smartest friends were dropping out of school to do YC. In 2014, I joined them by bailing on an internship to work for <a href="http://picnichealth.com/">Picnic Health</a> as they went through YC S14.</p><p>That summer I lived in a house in Redwood City with the rest of the team. YC forced us to focus and make progress each week. This culminated in Demo Day which allowed us to raise a seed round without much real traction.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_8nvbj2oFDnwe9iRc.jpg" alt="The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF."><figcaption>The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF.</figcaption></figure><p>At my mom's urging, I left Picnic Health to finish college, but that summer left a lasting impression. After graduating and joining <a href="http://benchling.com/">Benchling</a> (another YC startup), I watched jealously as friends started companies and got into YC.</p><h2 id="rejected-rejected-rejected-accepted">Rejected, Rejected, Rejected, Accepted</h2><p>After leaving Benchling to start my own company, I quickly learned that starting a company was much harder than expected. I applied to YC and got rejected. Rinse and repeat. I ended up starting 3 companies and getting rejected from YC three times.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_eGdhBVmpHcqwD4nj.png" alt="Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with Scooter Map."><figcaption>Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with <a href="https://scootermap.com/">Scooter Map</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>This March, as COVID spread in the US, I stayed up late talking with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/danqing_liu">Danqing</a> about what we could do to help. From these conversations, we built <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a> to help <a href="https://zmurl.com/whit2">a friend of mine</a> sell tickets to her Zoom Yoga classes.</p><p>In just a week, ZmURL went from an idea to being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">featured on TechCrunch</a>. To keep up with the growth, we focused on building product 7 days a week. For one weekend we took a break to lift our heads up, talk about the future, and to apply to YC.</p><p>To my surprise, after getting rejected three times, we got into YC for the current batch. Even more surprisingly, after weighing our options, we decided to turn down YC.</p><p>I realized that we applied to YC just because it was "the thing to do" and that YC is no longer the right fit for every startup. </p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_dTo3agVed4ANcClE.png" alt="The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever."><figcaption>The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-benefits-of-yc">The Benefits of YC</h2><p>Before explaining why we turned down YC, it's helpful to know what makes YC so awesome. From going thru YC with Picnic Health, YC helped us with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — Learn how to startup. Attend inspirational dinners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — You're forced to deliver results every week. Compete with your batchmates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network</strong> — Bond with other smart founders. Reach out to YC alums</p></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — YC is cool, it's cool to be part of YC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you are selling to startups, YC is full of them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — Demo Day builds buzz and FOMO.</p></li></ul><h2 id="yc-without-yc">YC Without YC</h2><p>Today, many of these benefits can be gained without joining YC while other aspects of YC have gotten worse due to the increased the batch size.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — YC has open sourced <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/">Startup Class</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — Write a <a href="https://victor.pont.is/article/weekly-update">weekly update</a> to friends or post your progress to Twitter.</p></li><li><div><p><strong>Network</strong> — Join an early stage startup. Meet interesting people online.</p><p>I was able to build an invaluable network of mentors over the past 5 years working at startups and starting companies in San Francisco. I've made interesting friends from posting on Twitter and reaching out just to chat with interesting people. (See Tweet below.)</p></div></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — You can build a personal brand by writing online, but the YC brand is very good.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you aren't selling to startups, you don't benefit as much from YC’s network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — From the founders I've talked to, the first remote Demo Day failed. This could have been due to COVID, so it'll be interesting to see how the next Demo Day goes...</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_3qWItqVzC2aoeI6N.png" alt="I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL."><figcaption>I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="who-should-do-yc">Who Should do YC</h2><p>YC is still the best tech accelerator and they are doing amazing work to make starting companies more accessible. YC is a great fit for you if are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A Tech Outsider</strong> — YC helps you meet other founders and can introduce you to any VC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selling to Startups</strong> — Stripe, Segment, Gusto, and Brex grew quickly by selling to other YC companies. As a YC founder, it's easy to reach out to alums and pitch them, although this is getting worse as the large batch sizes dilute the network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hungry for Prestige</strong> — YC used to be for outsiders. "Why would you start a company instead of work for Google?" But now joining YC is cool, so it's a valuable stop on the Harvard → McKinsey → MBA trajectory. (This has also contributed to YC's dilution.)</p></li></ul><p>While increasing the batch size is the right thing for YC (and for the world), it's made the experience worse for founders who get less facetime with partners and end up directly competing with batchmates. While YC told us there wouldn't be competitors in our batch, we've already seen at least 3 very similar companies in the current YC batch...</p><p>After weighing our options, we decided to skip YC and to try to raise a seed round. I'll talk about how that went in my next post...</p></div></div>]]>

<p dir="ltr">July&nbsp;28, 2020</p>
<p dir="ltr">In early June, my family had a distressing dinner-table conversation about medical research that was making headlines.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2020283?articleTools=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study,</a> eventually published in the venerable (and <a href="https://iai.asm.org/content/iai/79/10/3855/F1.large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retraction-prone</a>) <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, found that type A blood was associated with more severe Covid-19. Specifically, it found that patients with type A blood had a 50 percent increased likelihood of needing oxygen or a ventilator. That’s not good; early research in this pandemic suggested that one-third to one-half of patients who end up on ventilators die. My entire family is type A, including me. (Blood, not personality. As a writer, my personality is&nbsp;naturally type O. …Oof, bad pun.)</p>
<p>Obviously, this was unwelcome news. And it was the second study that had found a bad association with type A blood, although no one knew exactly why. “That is haunting me, quite frankly,” is how the<em> New York Times</em> quoted a German molecular geneticist who co-authored the NEJM study. Scary stuff.</p>
<p>Doctors popped up in articles and on YouTube theorizing (usually cautiously) why people with type A blood might have a different immune response to the coronavirus. The explanations were what my friend Mike Joyner of the Mayo Clinic calls “bioplausible.” That is, they are entirely logical, but also probably wrong.</p>
<p>While I wasn’t excited to hear the results of the blood type study, thanks to lessons I learned while reporting my first book, <em><a href="https://davidepstein.com/david-epstein-the-sports-gene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sports Gene</a></em>, I was very skeptical. My guess was that subsequent studies would either find a much smaller influence of blood type, or none at all.</p>
<p>In the two years I spent going through research on genetics and physiology, I came across a lot of studies that associated some physical trait with blood type. This, I learned, is how most of that body of research was created: a lab would be studying the genetic contribution to some physical characteristic, let’s say height, just for example; the lab collected blood from all subjects; as long as the researchers had blood, they decided they might as well get blood type data. Later on, when they analyzed all their data, they noticed a correlation between height and a certain&nbsp;blood type, and so they published it. It wasn’t the study they set out to do, but it’s an easy way to get&nbsp;another publication. Fine, nothing wrong with that in and of itself.</p>
<p>Except eventually I learned that a lot&nbsp;of labs were doing that because it’s so easy to do, and those that didn’t find an association just didn’t publish it. So all the positive findings got published, and few&nbsp;of the negative findings (i.e. those that found nothing)&nbsp;got published. This is what scientists know as “publication bias,” or, colloquially, “the file drawer problem,” so-called because&nbsp;studies that find no relationship&nbsp;end up stuffed in a file drawer, never to see the light of publication. In the topics I was probing for <em>The Sports Gene</em>, I saw this pattern several times: a study finds a strong association of some physical trait to blood type, then another study does too; then a few studies start to trickle in that show a much weaker association; then come the studies that show no association at all. Ultimately, the conclusion is that the early studies were false positives, and only scientists getting false positive results were initially publishing. (As psychologist <a href="https://twitter.com/drewhalbailey?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Bailey</a> taught me, this “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-24429-006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decline effect</a>” — the gradual drop in a reported&nbsp;effect over time as more studies are published — is an area of study unto itself.)</p>
<p>The good thing is that science often worked the way it should, eventually correcting the record. It just took a while. Amid&nbsp;the breakneck pace of coronavirus research and news, that’s kind of a problem, even when “a while” is measured in&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>Six weeks after my dinner-table conversation, a new round of studies found that blood type has little or nothing to do with Covid-19&nbsp;severity. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, the new findings received less attention. (But props to the <em>New York Times</em> for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/science/coronavirus-blood-type.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following up</a> its initial story. In my opinion, when this happens, the follow-up article should be linked at the top of the original story, so that anyone who sees the first piece&nbsp;also sees the corrective.)</p>
<p>Here’s the moral of the story for this moment in time: tons of data on Covid-19&nbsp;and patient characteristics is piling up all over the world, and scientists will be looking for and sharing all sorts of correlations. Many of those will be false positives, the result of statistical randomness. If the correlations are dramatic, they’ll grab headlines. Other researchers will (hopefully) subsequently try to replicate those findings, and often fail. The negative results will be less likely to get published. When they are published, they’ll be less likely to garner expansive news coverage.</p>
<p>My advice: if a particular Covid&nbsp;finding — say, the <a href="https://davidepstein.com/data-look-better-when-you-discount-the-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supposed curative effect</a> of hydroxychloroquine — grabs your attention, first treat it like a hypothesis, not a rock-solid conclusion. To use a phrase from chapter 11 of <a href="https://davidepstein.com/the-range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Range</em></a>, treat it like a “hunch held lightly.” Then set up a news alert so you have a better chance of noticing if&nbsp;the original study is contradicted. And keep in mind that the initial positive results are likely to be the most dramatic that are ever found, which is why they were published in the first place.</p>
<p>Finally, this lesson applies to <em>all</em>&nbsp;research, but I think it’s especially worrisome in drug trials. A&nbsp;recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6190062/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">examination</a> of 105 clinical trials of&nbsp;certain antidepressants showed that 53 of the&nbsp;trials found&nbsp;the drugs to be&nbsp;effective, and 52 of the trials&nbsp;found them to be ineffective. But while 52 of the 53 positive&nbsp;trials&nbsp;were published, only 25 of the negative trials were published. So the body of published research is badly distorted compared to the actual scientific findings. Even an extremely&nbsp;conscientious doctor —&nbsp;one&nbsp;who pores over that&nbsp;entire&nbsp;medical literature —&nbsp;may well conclude that the drugs are more effective than they really are.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS IN-THE-WEEDS TIP</strong>: <strong>The Funnel Plot</strong> (You already read the main point, so feel free to skip!)</p>
<p>There’s a really neat visualization called a “funnel plot” that helps demonstrate the publication bias issue I just described. Below is a funnel plot from a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study </a>that analyzed other studies of whether probiotics prevent gastrointestinal disease.</p>
<p>Every dot in the chart represents a single study of probiotics and GI disease. On the x-axis is a measure of whether probiotics increase or decrease GI&nbsp;disease risk. A negative number means probiotics decrease risk, so that’s what you want. The y-axis is a measure of how reliable a study is (basically how large the study is); the higher up the y-axis a datapoint is, the more reliable that particular study. Ok, take a look:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/db2247ae2edcbf980ad58f675/images/746c1562-55aa-4219-9c2d-cb1e2644e768.png" alt="" width="275" height="182" data-file-id="5194118"></p>
<p>This is called a funnel plot because when you plot each study as a separate data point, you see a sort of funnel shape, with studies all over the place at the bottom and clustering as they move up the y-axis.</p>
<p>What that means is that the smaller studies (those lower on the reliability scale, i.e. the y-axis) have widely varying results. Some of those small studies find that probiotics have a huge beneficial impact on GI disease, and others — to the right of 0 on the x-axis — find that probiotics actually increase the risk of GI disease. So what’s the deal?</p>
<p>Well, as we look up the y-axis, the more reliable studies cluster close to zero on the x-axis, or “no effect at all.” That is:&nbsp;the crappier studies are all over the map, because small studies are more likely to have extreme outcomes just by chance, and the larger, probably-more-accurate studies are bunched together near what is probably the real answer: nothing at all.</p>
<p>Actually, they’re bunched&nbsp;just to the left of zero, so the authors of this paper conclude that probiotics probably have a modest beneficial effect.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/db2247ae2edcbf980ad58f675/images/c3b81a17-f93b-4202-84b4-7d6233932c81.png" alt="" width="275" height="182" data-file-id="5194122"></p>
<p>But even that’s not a sure thing. Notice that the lower right part of the funnel is conspicuously sparse. That’s a telltale signature of publication bias. Essentially, the scientists who are doing small studies are more likely to publish extreme results when they go in the titillating direction — in this case, when they find that probiotics protect against GI disease.</p>
<p>The story in the funnel plot above probably played out over years&nbsp;like blood type and Covid&nbsp;severity did over weeks: early on, researchers run small studies and only those who find provocative results publish them. Over time, as other scientists try to replicate the result with better study methods, it lessens or disappears entirely. My guess: if all the relevant probiotic studies were published, the apparent effect&nbsp;of probiotics&nbsp;would be even closer to zero than it already is.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for reading.&nbsp;Until next time….</p>

            <p>Today we are going to talk about some of my favorite tips, which are super easy to implement or to follow, and that can make your JavaScript code cleaner. Also keep in mind some of the things we are going to learn today apply to JavaScript in general, though the article will focus on React.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="object-destructuring">Object destructuring</h2>
<p>To get started we will review object destructuring, one of my favorites actually, that can help to keep the code small, clean, and elegant. This topic I love so much that I actually made a whole post about it here: <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-15-write-cleaner-code-by-using-javascript-destructuring/">Write Cleaner Code By Using JavaScript Destructuring</a>.
Destructuring allows you to break down complex structures into simpler parts. Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> { <span>title</span> } <span>=</span> <span>props</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>title</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>A common place where React developers use this technique is with props. Though some people may argue that you lose context when you split the variables, it is usually the case in React, that the context is inherited by the component itself. Let’s take a look at an example to show what I mean.</p>
<p>First, let’s write a simple component to show Task information on the screen:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="react"><span>function</span> <span>TaskView</span>(<span>props</span>) {
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;{<span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>title</span>}&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;{<span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>description</span>}&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>span</span>&gt;{<span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>}&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;
    )
}
</code></pre></div><p>It is indeed very simple, however, look at how we repeat props all the time, not very pretty. Let’s look at another way to implement this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="react"><span>function</span> <span>TaskView</span>(<span>props</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>task</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;{<span>task</span>.<span>title</span>}&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;{<span>task</span>.<span>description</span>}&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>span</span>&gt;{<span>task</span>.<span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>}&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;
    )
}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s a bit better but still, we have tasks everywhere. Now someone who perhaps doesn’t know destructuring may be tempted to do something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>title</span>
<span>const</span> <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>description</span>
</code></pre></div><p>which adds too much overhead to the declarations. Let’s now see how the component looks like when using destructuring.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="react"><span>function</span> <span>TaskView</span>(<span>props</span>) {
    <span>const</span> { <span>title</span>, <span>description</span>, <span>completed</span> } <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;{<span>title</span>}&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;{<span>description</span>}&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>span</span>&gt;{<span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>}&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;
    )
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now the code is very simple, we keep the JSX very clean from the rest, and we are still in context. It’s perfectly understandable that when we say <code>title</code> we are talking about the <code>Task</code> as is what the component is all about. So keep your names clean, and structure well your components and you will love this feature.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="simplify-your-conditional-statements">Simplify your conditional statements</h2>
<p>In this section, I want to talk about 3 different scenarios that can help us increase the readability of our code, and it’s so easy, though many times we forget to do it.</p>
<h3 id="conditional-execution">Conditional execution</h3>
<p>It is normal that at some point we need to run a statement only if a certain condition happens to be true. Usually, it goes something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>if</span> (<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>)) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong with that code, however, it can be simplified a bit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Nice, but how does it work? JavaScript as many other languages, read conditional statements such us <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> in order from left to right, and they exit at the time they can invalidate the arguments.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of this with all conditionals:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>t</span> <span>===</span> <span>1</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>t</span> <span>===</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>t</span> <span>===</span> <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In that example, JS will first take the first expression <code>t === 1</code>, since that expression is truthy and we have an <code>and</code> conditional, it needs to evaluate the next expression, as we need to guarantee they are all truthy. When it evaluates <code>t === 2</code>, which is falsy, it doesn’t need to evaluate <code>t === 3</code> at all, it can save that compute as we know the whole statement happens to be <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Amazing! now let’s learn something more about this. It is very common on the internet to see examples of this, however, did you know you can also use the <code>||</code> operator as well?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>) <span>||</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>) <span>// does not execute the console.log
</span><span></span><span>isFive</span>(<span>10</span>) <span>||</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is not the number five!'</span>) <span>// it executes the console.log
</span></code></pre></div><p>Did you notice that what we just did would be equivalent to apply a not to our first example?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>) <span>// it executes the console.log
</span><span></span><span>!</span><span>isFive</span>(<span>10</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is not the number five!'</span>) <span>// it executes the console.log
</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="ternary-operator">Ternary operator</h3>
<p>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.</p>
<p>This is very commonly used to show different statuses or components to the user depending on a conditional statement. Though I don’t always recommend to use the ternary operator, sometimes a good old fashion if does the job very well. It can be extremely useful for small things.</p>
<p>Take a look a the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>completed</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'Completed'</span>
} <span>else</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>'Pending'</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Another variation of that, which I still see around is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>completed</span>) { <span>return</span> <span>'Completed'</span>} <span>else</span> { <span>return</span> <span>'Pending'</span> }
</code></pre></div><p>I’m not here to judge, but that can get real messy. Let’s take a look at a way using the ternary operator</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>return</span> <span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Much nicer!</p>
<h3 id="optional-chaining">Optional Chaining</h3>
<p>Last but not least, we have optional chaining (<code>?.</code>) that allows reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate each reference.</p>
<p>In plain English, it helps to avoid a bunch of <code>if</code> statements just to make sure we have a value on a nested property. Let’s look at an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>juan</span> <span>=</span> {
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Juan'</span>,
    <span>marriedTo</span><span>:</span> {
        <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Diana'</span>
    }
}

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>marriedTo</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// Diana
</span><span></span><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
</span></code></pre></div><p>Ups…. when we tried to access the name of the person we are divorced from, we get an error, because <code>divorcedFrom</code> in our case is undefined. Normally we would solve it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span>.<span>name</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>But that can also get out of hands by adding a lot of ifs just for this purpose. There is a better way using optional chaining.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>juan</span> <span>=</span> {
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Juan'</span>,
    <span>marriedTo</span><span>:</span> {
        <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Diana'</span>
    }
}

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>marriedTo</span><span>?</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// Diana
</span><span></span><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span><span>?</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// undefined
</span></code></pre></div><p>And this can apply to multiple levels</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>juan</span>.<span>marriedTo</span><span>?</span>.<span>disvorcedFrom</span><span>?</span>.<span>kids</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Very nice! Let’s move on with the next topic.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="spread-operator">Spread Operator</h2>
<p>There is no React app without making use of the spread operator, maybe that’s exaggerated, but the spread operator is widely used in react applications, especially when working with reducers, though it is much more than just for that. This is another topic which I covered extensively in the article <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-05-23-how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript/">How to Use the Spread Operator (…) in JavaScript</a>. I really recommend that you read it, it’s pretty cool and covers the topic in detail.</p>
<p>The spread operator allows you to expand an iterable object into a list of its individual elements. Let’s better take a look into some examples:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>x</span>, <span>y</span>, <span>z</span>) {
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span>
}

<span>const</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>=</span> [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>sum</span>(...<span>numbers</span>)) <span>// 6
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, what we are doing is to transform an <code>array</code> into separate variables that are passed to our <code>sum</code> function. It’s a pretty neat trick. But we can also apply it for objects:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>obj1</span> <span>=</span> { <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'bar'</span>, <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>42</span> }
<span>const</span> <span>obj2</span> <span>=</span> { <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'baz'</span>, <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>13</span> }

<span>const</span> <span>copyObj1</span> <span>=</span> { ...<span>obj1</span> } <span>// This copies all the properties of obj1 into a new object.
</span><span></span>
<span>const</span> <span>merged</span> <span>=</span> { ...<span>obj1</span>, ...<span>obj2</span> } <span>// This merges all the properties of obj1 and obj2 into a new object.
</span><span></span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>merged</span>) <span>// {foo: "baz", x: 42, y: 13}
</span></code></pre></div><p>Because we can use this to create new objects or arrays, its ideal to use with Redux, as we can avoid mutating the original objects.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="template-literals">Template Literals</h2>
<p>Though very popular and beginners friendly, no list would be completed without them. Template literals are basically strings, but not any string, they allow embedded expressions. Let’s take a look.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`this is a string literal`</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>In its more basic form, a string literal is just a string, however, note that for it to be a string literal it must use <code>`</code> instead of <code>"</code> or <code>'</code>. It’s a small detail but makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>String literals, for example, support multi-line strings:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`line 1
</span><span>line 2`</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Or you can also embed expressions</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>25</span>

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`a: </span><span>${</span><span>a</span><span>}</span><span> and b: </span><span>${</span><span>b</span><span>}</span><span> but more importantly a+b = </span><span>${</span><span>a</span><span>+</span><span>b</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>) <span>// a: 10 and b: 25 but more importantly a+b = 35
</span></code></pre></div><p>Really cool!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>JavaScript is packed with useful operators, expressions and tricks to power up our development skills, and writer cleaner code. It is also true that some of the things I mention can be personal judgment, but if you look at the React code written on very popular projects you will see they apply these small things all over the place. So they are really good to learn and implement when you write your next React component.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>

July 28, 2020 | https://numinous.productions/timeful/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://numinous.productions/timeful/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>The most powerful books reach beyond their pages—beyond those few hours in which they’re read—and indelibly transform how serious readers see the world. Few books achieve such transcendent impact, yet given their physical constraints, it’s remarkable that any do. As a medium, books have no direct means of communicating with readers over time. The physical text is stuck on the page, generally read linearly and continuously in a few sittings.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To be transformed by a book, readers must do more than absorb information: they must bathe in the book’s ideas, relate those ideas to experiences in their lives over weeks and months, try on the book’s mental models like a new hat. Unfortunately, readers must drive that process for themselves. Authors can’t easily guide this ongoing sense-making: their words are stuck on pages which have already been read. How might one create a medium which does the job of a book, but which escapes a book’s shackled sense of time? How might one create <em>timeful texts</em>—texts with affordances extending the authored experience over weeks and months, texts which continue the conversation with the reader as they slowly integrate those ideas into their lives?</p>
			
			<p>Each year, hundreds of thousands of students study <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em>. The text presents endless facts and figures, but its goal is not simply to transmit reference material. The book aspires to convey a strong sense of how to think like a cell biologist—a way of looking at questions, at phenomena, and at oneself. For example, it contains nuanced discussions of microscopy techniques, but readers can’t meaningfully try on those ways of thinking while they’re reading. Readers must carry this book’s ideas into their daily interactions in the lab, watching for moments which relate to the exercises or which give meaning to the authors’ advice.<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat1.png" role="presentation"> This model of change is brittle: the right situation must arise while the book is still fresh in readers’ minds; they must notice the relevance of the situation; they must remember the book’s details; they must reflect on their experience and how it relates to the book’s ideas; and so on.</p>
			<p>As we consider alternative approaches, we can find inspiration in the world’s most transformative books. Consider texts like the Bible and the Analects of Confucius. People integrate ideas from those books into their lives over time—but not because authors designed them that way. Those books work because they’re surrounded by rich cultural activity. Weekly sermons and communities of practice keep ideas fresh in readers’ minds and facilitate ongoing connections to lived experiences. This is a powerful approach for powerful texts, requiring extensive investment from readers and organizers. We can’t build cathedrals for every book. Sophisticated readers adopt similar methods to study less exalted texts, but most people lack the necessary skills, drive, and cultural contexts. How might we design texts to more widely enable such practices?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat2.png" role="presentation">
			<p>Guided meditation smartphone apps offer a promising design approach. Meditation’s insights unfold slowly. Aspirants are typically advised to practice daily. Over weeks and months, they may begin to experience the world differently. Some concepts in meditation make no sense if you still can’t perceive your breath clearly, so they’re best introduced later. A book on meditation isn’t well-suited to this kind of slow unfurling: much of it may not make sense initially; readers will need to re-read it again and again as their practice progresses. But a guided meditation app’s experience is naturally spread over time. Each day’s session begins and ends with brief instruction. Instructors offer topical prompts throughout the practice. Intermittent repetition can keep old ideas active in students’ minds until they’re ready to engage. Rather than delivering a bound monograph on meditation, instructors can slowly unfurl an idea over hundreds of days. Critically, these apps are a mass medium, just as books are: lessons can be “written” once and redistributed cheaply to huge audiences. Could this approach be applied more generally?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat3.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To engage with a book’s ideas over time, readers must remember its details, and <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books">that’s already a challenge</a>. One promising solution lies in <a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition memory systems</a>, which allow users to retain large quantities of knowledge reliably and efficiently. Like meditation, these systems involve a daily practice: every day, a reader maintains their memory library by reviewing a few dozen lightweight prompts. Each prompt asks a detailed question, like “What types of stimuli does George Miller’s span of absolute judgment describe?” Each day’s session is different because each prompt repeats on its own schedule. When a user remembers or forgets the answer to a prompt, the system expands or contracts that prompt’s repetition interval along an exponential curve. These expanding intervals allow readers to maintain a collection of thousands of prompts while reviewing only a few dozen each day. Practitioners generally complete their review sessions in moments which would otherwise go unused, like when waiting in line.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/timeline.png" alt="This figure illustrates pages of a book being presented along a timeline of expanding intervals.">
			<p>Despite their efficacy, these systems are not yet widely adopted. One important barrier to adoption is that it’s surprisingly difficult to write good prompts. To explore one potential solution, we created an experimental quantum computing textbook, <em><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a></em>. It’s written in a “<a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">mnemonic medium</a>,” interleaving expert-authored spaced repetition prompts into the reading experience. Our goal was to help readers engage with challenging technical material by supporting their memory. <img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat2.png" role="presentation">As we interviewed readers, though, we noticed that the regular review sessions didn’t just build detailed retention: the ongoing practice also changed readers’ relationship to the material by maintaining their contact with it over time. These people didn’t just read the book once and proceed with their lives. <em>Quantum Country</em>’s review sessions returned readers to its ideas again and again over weeks and months.</p>
			<p><em>Quantum Country</em>’s prompts are designed to help readers remember technical material, but it may be possible to adapt similar mechanisms to support future timeful texts.</p>
			<p>Consider <em>The Elements of Style</em>, a classic writing primer by Strunk and White. The authors demonstrate the value of parallel construction with this example from the Bible: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” But it’s not enough to read an example. Good writers’ ears become automatically alert to these constructions. They notice opportunities to create parallelisms, and they notice dissonance when similar phrases are presented differently. It takes time to develop this awareness.</p>
			<p>What if, a week after learning about parallel construction, a reader’s review session included this prompt?</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The following quote has been modified to remove a parallel construction. How might you rewrite it to add parallel construction? How do the two differ in effect?</p>
				<p>“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Instead, reflect on what you can contribute to these United States.” (modified from a quote by John F. Kennedy, which would be revealed in its original form once the reader had finished with the prompt)</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A week or two later, a similar prompt might appear with a different distorted quote. For example: “You can fool all the people some of the time, and you can mislead many listeners consistently. But you won’t be able to fool everyone reliably.” (adapted from Abraham Lincoln)</p>
			<p>Such prompts might seem onerous or strange on their own, but what if most educated people maintained a regular review practice of the kind we’ve described? The example reflection prompt would sit between others on physics, poetry, and whatever else you’d been thinking about. If you found the prompt useful, it would recur in another week; if not, perhaps it would reappear in a few months. A book like <em>The Elements of Style</em> might include dozens or hundreds of prompts like these on various topics, so that you’d see one or two each day over weeks and months as you integrate its ideas into the way you view and practice writing.</p>
			<p>In early chapters of <em>Quantum Country</em>, readers see every prompt as they read the text, and the prompts remain the same in the ensuing review sessions. But in the final chapter, we added a new kind of prompt which changes over time in a programmed sequence. Perhaps future timeful texts could unfurl their contents over the course of many sessions, much as we observed that digital meditation lessons do.</p>
			<p>Of course, spaced repetition is just one approach for writing timeful texts. What other powerful tools might it be possible to create, making future books into artifacts that transcend their pages, as they slowly help readers shape their lives?</p>

One even sees increasing talk about the need for better online social networks — ones that foster positive human experience and development, reasonable thinking and imaginative creation.</p><p id="a079">What I haven’t yet seen, however, is much real understanding of why our current online social networks are the way they are, and what might be done to fix them.</p><p id="46c1">What we need to create a better social network, in my view, is relatively straightforward to state:</p><p id="eb94"><strong>1.</strong> Code should be open source.</p><p id="e4af"><strong>2. </strong>Ownership and control should be decentralized… so there is no company and no government tasked and burdened with calling all the shots. Embedding blockchain technologies deep in the technical design of the network is the right way to achieve this.</p><p id="f752"><strong>3.</strong> Major decisions should be made democratically. If some group systematically doesn’t like the outcomes votes are getting, they can fork the code and make a new version, or copy the code and create a new network using the same software.</p><p id="d04a"><strong>4.</strong> Recommendations of connections and content should be made using AI that has the ability to explain the reasons behind its judgments — and these explanations need to be shown routinely to users in a way they can understand.</p><p id="c2c7">Due to SingularityNET and a variety of other recent developments, we already have the basic technologies needed to support this sort of approach — as far as tech is concerned, we could have decentralized, democratic, transparent and ethical alternatives to Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and so forth right now. We even have some existing websites — such as <a href="http://minds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minds.com</a> — embodying significant parts of the above.</p><p id="ab48">What we still don’t have — yet! — is the alignment of resources to get alternatives fulfilling all four of the above points fully built-out … and then pushed toward wide adoption.</p><p id="6e32">In this essay, I’m going to dig a bit into the collective-psychology implications of current centralized social networks and future potential decentralized alternatives. Given the key role that social networks currently play in channelling, guiding and crystallizing collective human thought and emotion, these are not just issues regarding the infrastructure of a particular technology sector — they may actually be critical to the future path of humanity.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png" width="1288" height="709" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="7b1f">The current mode of organizing social networks presents companies like Facebook with seemingly unsolvable problems. Should Facebook take down racist posts? What about posts with indirect racist implications? Posts explicitly aimed at affecting political elections using false information? What about questionable information? What makes information “too questionable”?</p><p id="5947">In relatively free regions like e.g. the US or Western Europe, government’s role in modulating public speech is restricted to extreme cases of directly dangerous speech (directly advocating violence, explicit forms of “hate speech” etc.). I believe this is for the best, as the alternative of giving government stronger control over speech has glaringly obvious failure modes — i.e. it can be used by fascist-minded government leaders to squelch the public dialogue needed to organize opposition to their rule.</p><p id="19e4">However, less extreme, less directly dangerous instances of public speaking can also have a dramatic and systematically destructive impact on individual minds and the public mind — and in the current situation in the “free world”, these are being modulated by corporations in a very ad hoc way. And these corporations, run by digital marketing and tech geek types, are wholly unsuited to the subtle problem of modulating online information, knowledge and relationship flow for humanity. These organizations are optimized for delivering software and delivering ads and making money — not for guiding the public mind toward the broader good.</p><p id="dfa8">On the positive side, there are all sorts of brilliant ideas and wonderful creations being put out there on the Internet every minute of every day — but most of these have a hard time finding the audience they deserve because most of the currently widely operational information dissemination mechanisms are oriented toward corporate profit maximization rather than general human (or transhuman!) benefit maximization.</p><p id="8343">So given that it’s best to keep governments out of the modulation of non-extreme, not-directly-dangerous public speech — and given also that corporations running social media networks are not well suited for the job — then what can we do?</p><p id="fb1f">What we can do, of course, is roll out information and relationship coordination systems that allow the community of individuals engaged in social networks to carry out intelligent information and relationship management themselves — via their explicit judgments and decisions, and their implicit actions.</p><p id="2b59">SingularityNET’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation system</a> is one tool designed to help with this — it provides a framework for leveraging data regarding user behaviours to estimate the reputation or value that a given user assigned to another person or an information source or piece of information. Using tools like this, each person guides what information they see, based on AI algorithms calibrated for their own benefit rather than the benefit of corporations seeking to profit from them.</p><p id="82b6">You can learn more this here <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation systems for marketplaces</a>, also on the following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.singularitynet.io/computing-reputation-for-discourse-users-with-aigents-25b806277e74]">Discourse forums</a>.</p><p id="c6ed">But how can people know these AI algorithms are acting for their own benefit? Transparent and explainable AI is another key ingredient here. SingularityNET reputation system can leverage either opaque or transparent AI for making predictions of how much a given user will appreciate a given other person, source or datum. Embedding neural-symbolic AI into the reputation system is one strategy that can enable a reasonable degree of explainability, as symbolic patterns can generally be simplified and rearranged into explainable form via automated transformations.</p><p id="5a97">Creating analogues of modern social networks architected according to the above principles would not be incredibly hard given available technologies. There would be a lot of engineering required, but mankind is now capable of doing a lot of engineering.</p><p id="51c0">The essential reason fair and democratic and non-stupid large-scale social networks built along these lines do not exist, is that nobody with adequate financial resources has wanted to put in the money to build one.</p><p id="81c9">One may ask why such a thing hasn’t just been created by volunteer OSS developers or entrepreneurial devs. One core issue is that such a social network framework would only be valuable once it had a lot of users. Because of this, the reality or perception is that getting such a project off the ground at this stage — with huge entrenched centralized competitors — would require a massive marketing budget.</p><p id="fa00">I would love to see SingularityNET and OpenCog used as foundational tools for the implementation and operation of this sort of social network, and would welcome partnerships with other groups interested to collaborate on this sort of work.</p><p id="40ff">But what I want to explore a little more here in this article are some of the subtler reasons why <strong><em>transparency, explainability and decentralization are so important in social network construction</em></strong>.</p><p id="c6a9">I’m going to get a little theoretical here — but before long I’ll get back to the practical.</p><p id="9d73">How and why did our social networks become this way?</p><p id="d63e">Of course, the profit motive underlying the companies that build and operate these social networks — Facebook, Twitter and the rest — is part of the problem. The goal of the social network becomes maximum addictiveness because this is the most straightforward way to maximize profit in this particular business niche … and human psychology being what it is, the way to achieve maximum addictiveness is to appeal to a mix of emotions in a rather perverse way.</p><p id="df6a">Much as junk food perverts our taste and smell system to create unhealthy addictive food experiences of a sort that didn’t exist in the Paleolithic environment we evolved for, similarly, current social networks pervert our social, cognitive and emotional systems to create unhealthy addictive informational and relational experiences of a sort that didn’t exist before Internet tech came along.</p><p id="2f30">But the drive to profit from maximum addictiveness is only one of the more proximal aspects of the problem. The destructive perversity we see in modern social networks is a self-organizing phenomenon, which is fed by the drive on the part of social network designers to create addictive experiences but has additional special properties.</p><p id="17af">The nature of addiction is that: <strong><em>Not only is the addictive thing enjoyable, but its absence is painful … and the amount needed to get enjoyment keeps going up.</em></strong> So if you’re addicted to something, the more you use it, the more urgently you need to use it more… etc. in a feedback loop.</p><p id="220e">One may rephrase this as:<strong><em> The more an addictive thing is done, the less psychological energy it takes to do it again … and the more psychological energy it takes to not do it again.</em></strong></p><p id="a5c6">In a way addiction is a lot like long-term potentiation (LTP), a basic principle of learning in the brain — the more a synaptic connection between two neurons is used, the easier it gets for the charge to spread along that connection. I.e., the more that charge flows along with a connection, the less energy has to be spent to get a given amount of charge to the other end of that connection.</p><p id="d2d7">LTP in the brain — also known as “<a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Hebbian_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebbian learning</a>” after 1940s neural learning theorist Donald Hebb — leads to the formation of complex cell assemblies representing knowledge, ideas, behaviours and so forth. Similarly, addictive dynamics in social networks — addiction to messaging in particular groups, or to particular people, in particular …</p></div></div></section></div>

<figcaption>Ma Yuan, Scholar Viewing a Waterfall</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Georges Dumézil in his 1929 book Flamen-Brahman proposed that Proto-Indo-European society was divided into three distinct social groups: The productive class, which practiced agriculture, pastoralism, and artisanship; the martial class, which waged war and defended the tribe; and the sovereign class, wielding authority both juridicial and spiritual, whose place it was to rule. As societies grew more complex and division of labor became more granular, further specializations came to be recognized, but they remained grounded in the original tripartite: worker, warrior, and priest.</p>

<p>The earliest incarnation of the priestly class made sense of the chaos of the natural world, locating agency in what appeared to be random processes. They performed rituals in an effort to beseech or control the spirits or gods that governed the land. They read the auspices by which the gods made their will known to mortals. They served as the memory of a people and enacted judgment against transgressors.</p>

<p>The priestly role is, in a word, systematization. Their chief purpose is to construct the reality in which their adherents live. They provide order and grounding, defining the base truths those of a society take axiomatically. It is on these axioms that all else is built.</p>

<p>It is customary to divide the history of communication into four periods: oral, manuscript, print, and electronic. Systems native to each period were in large part defined by the the means they provided to catalog and disseminate information. Writing enabled the development of institutions of knowledge unbound by the limits of memory and generational transmission, marking a shift from teaching and knowing to study and interpretation. Print allowed for texts to be distributed to the masses directly rather than dictated by an intermediary and enlisted their participation in the act of interpreting. The internet now is the means by which anyone may author and transmit their own texts unencumbered by previous physical constraints.</p>

<p>The Church in the manuscript era constructed a shared reality, a substratum of truth binding its members together and which they sought to recruit all peoples into, which we may call Christendom. The Reformation, waxing alongside print, irrevocably destroyed this framework; however, the Protestant faiths by nature could never provide the same unity of purpose. Instead, the writers who reformulated concepts such as rights and sovereignty such that they could stand alone, as axioms, laid the groundwork for the new reality to follow. In this way secularism, republicanism, and such can be seen neither as a salve for the century of bloodshed the Reformation inaugurated, nor as the culmination of the ideas Luther put forward. Rather, they formed a distinct set of beliefs competing for and eventually winning preeminence in lands Catholic and Protestant alike over a longer, multi-century period of religious war. This worldview likewise energizes its adherents to spread it across the globe, and it remains the most powerful and widespread meaning-making system to this day, commanding the mass of peoples that we may call the Public.</p>

<p>With the internet, we are in the early stages of its destruction. The trend from the rotary press to the television was cohesion, toward a unitary Public. The trend for the past two and a half decades has been one of fragmentation, a diffusion of various publics. Just as the Church formed the basis of people's understanding of themselves and the society they lived in in the era of the manuscript, and the press did the same in the era of print, a new mode is emerging shaped by present technology.</p>

<p>The major platforms at present incentivize the profusion of cloistered micro-communities, exchanging ideas among themselves and with their immediate neighbors that come to form their own realities inscrutable to outsiders. This is not a necessary consequence of the underlying technology, but rather the result of design decisions made by the programmers who author these systems. Discourse over how platforms "ought" to function tends to focus on a tension between the desire of tech companies to operate as simple businesses disinterested in higher questions against a perceived necessity for them to fill the role once occupied by the press as defenders of liberal democracy. This framing, however, misses the wealth of options available beyond letting events run their course or stemming the unwinding of the present order. A programmer class conscious of its potential to fill the now-vacant priestly role could leverage this position for arbitrary ends, design its systems to shape the reality of its choosing. Whether one finds this intriguing or frightening is a matter of taste.</p>

<p>❧</p>

<p>Before there was writing, there was speech. Orality is best regarded as a technology in its own right, with its own techniques and affordances. In contrast to a common view of oral culture as necessarily egalitarian and collaborative, the priestly role, concerned with narration and preservation of societal memory, was a specialized one. The guru-shishya system of preserving the Vedas was the most highly developed form and serves as a testament to the possibility for thoroughness without relying on the written word. Students learned various recitations, or pathas, of the corpus—continuous, word-by-word, with or without euphonic combinations—and their consonance served as a built-in form of error-checking. Phonology was standardized as the Vedic pitch accent, sidestepping the problem many traditions have with linguistic drift. Putting the Vedas to paper was later done almost as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Most cultures were not nearly as thorough or organized, however, and over time many traditions drifted or diverged from their original forms. Especially in times of upheaval, there are no caches of texts to rediscover after the crisis abates. Tellers must simply make do with what they are given, and indeed the kernel of a shared tradition can often be found in wildly divergent bodies of knowledge from cultures cleaved from each other by distance, war, or time.</p>

<p>The advent of written language allowed oral cultures to be centralized and canonized, relieving the burdens and lossiness of memory. Traditions were made into texts, singular and authoritative. Externalizing memory to papyrus or parchment enormously expanded the scope of what could be retained. It also eliminated the necessity for exactitude and endless repetition when instructing students, allowing for a stronger focus on meaning and interpretation.</p>

<p>Socrates called writing "the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom" in a dialogue with Phaedrus, remarking that it enabled surface-level understandings and made up for deficiencies of recall. He goes on however to make a rather subtler point:</p>

<blockquote> Writing, Phaedrus, has this strange quality, and is very like painting; for the creatures of painting stand like living beings, but if one asks them a question, they preserve a solemn silence. And so it is with written words; you might think they spoke as if they had intelligence, but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they always say only one and the same thing. And every word, when once it is written, is bandied about, alike among those who understand and those who have no interest in it, and it knows not to whom to speak or not to speak; when ill-treated or unjustly reviled it always needs its father to help it; for it has no power to protect or help itself.</blockquote>

<p>Writing, he argues, cannot elaborate on its meaning any further than what is written, a quality unlike that of a speaker. But where Socrates sees this as an objective deficiency, it instead comes to serve as a defining characteristic of the written word. With no necessity for chain of transmission from author to student, independent interpretation and commentary become central to text. Where the priesthoods of orality focused on memory, the priesthoods of the manuscript monopolized meaning.</p>

<p>As the Vedic guru-shishya traditions exemplify a structure defined by orality, Catholic Christianity serves as one shaped by the manuscript. Catholicism had since its institutionalization with the conversion of Constantine, been intensely hierarchical and strictly focused on the precision of doctrine. Many of its major controversies centered on theological disagreements by the clergy on unsettled questions of interpretation. In contrast to explicitly outsider folk movements such as the earlier gnostics or later medieval heresies, those pushing positions later declared anathema under labels such as Arianism, Nestorianism, or Monophysitism were insiders made into outsiders by conciliar fiat. The Great Schism, despite originating as a political dispute, became a dogmatic one as the two churches diverged, with East moving toward an experiential focus with theoria and hesychasm, while West embraced pagan philosophy and the austere studiousness defined of an emerging scholasticism.</p>

<p>Catholicism, in other words, evolved into a system organized around command structure and authoritative interpretation of texts exclusively done by the priestly class. As dogma proceeded down the hierarchy and completely excluded the input of the laity, much of the role of the clergy was to dictate to congregants passages of text and their proper meanings. The primary duty of lay members in Catholicism was to receive, in faith, the sacraments. Their access to and understanding of scripture was mediated by the figure of the priest, who offered narration during Mass and guidance during Penance. Lay Bible-reading was not only unnecessary for salvation but actively discouraged all the way until Vatican II, and to this day the practice is comparatively rare next to the Protestant traditions.</p>

<p>Being the educated class par excellence, the priesthood and the rulership were long intertwined. Pepin the Short, in concert with Pope Zachary, …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>



<h3 id="which-shell-to-use">Which Shell to Use</h3>

<p>Bash is the only shell scripting language permitted for
executables.</p>

<p>Executables must start with <code>#!/bin/bash</code> and a minimum
number of flags. Use <code>set</code> to set shell options so that
calling your script as <code>bash script_name</code>
does not break its functionality.</p>

<p>Restricting all executable shell scripts to <em>bash</em> gives us a
consistent shell language that’s installed on all our machines.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is where you’re forced to by whatever
you’re coding for. One example of this is Solaris SVR4 packages
which require plain Bourne shell for any scripts.</p>



<h3 id="when-to-use-shell">When to use Shell</h3>

<p>Shell should only be used for small utilities or simple wrapper
scripts.</p>

<p>While shell scripting isn’t a development language, it is used for
writing various utility scripts throughout Google. This style guide
is more a recognition of its use rather than a suggestion that it be
used for widespread deployment.</p>

<p>Some guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re mostly calling other utilities and are doing relatively
little data manipulation, shell is an acceptable choice for the task.</li>
  <li>If performance matters, use something other than shell.</li>
  <li>If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, or
that uses non-straightforward control flow logic, you should
rewrite it in a more structured language <em>now</em>. Bear in
mind that scripts grow. Rewrite your script early to avoid a more
time-consuming rewrite at a later date.</li>
  <li>When assessing the complexity of your code (e.g. to decide whether
to switch languages) consider whether the code is easily
maintainable by people other than its author.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="shell-files-and-interpreter-invocation">Shell Files and Interpreter Invocation</h2>



<h3 id="file-extensions">File Extensions</h3>

<p>Executables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a
<code>.sh</code> extension. Libraries must have a <code>.sh</code>
extension and should not be executable.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to know what language a program is written in when
executing it and shell doesn’t require an extension so we prefer not
to use one for executables.</p>

<p>However, for libraries it’s important to know what language it is and
sometimes there’s a need to have similar libraries in different
languages. This allows library files with identical purposes but
different languages to be identically named except for the
language-specific suffix.</p>



<h3 id="suidsgid">SUID/SGID</h3>

<p>SUID and SGID are <em>forbidden</em> on shell scripts.</p>

<p>There are too many security issues with shell that make it nearly
impossible to secure sufficiently to allow SUID/SGID. While bash does
make it difficult to run SUID, it’s still possible on some platforms
which is why we’re being explicit about banning it.</p>

<p>Use <code>sudo</code> to provide elevated access if you need it.</p>



<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>



<h3 id="stdout-vs-stderr">STDOUT vs STDERR</h3>

<p>All error messages should go to <code>STDERR</code>.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to separate normal status from actual issues.</p>

<p>A function to print out error messages along with other status
information is recommended.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>err<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"[</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> +<span>'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z'</span><span>)</span><span>]: </span><span>$*</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;2
<span>}</span>

<span>if</span> <span>!</span> do_something<span>;</span> <span>then
  </span>err <span>"Unable to do_something"</span>
  <span>exit </span>1
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>









<p>Start each file with a description of its contents.</p>

<p>Every file must have a top-level comment including a brief overview of
its contents. A
copyright notice
and author information are optional.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Perform hot backups of Oracle databases.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>Any function that is not both obvious and short must be commented. Any
function in a library must be commented regardless of length or
complexity.</p>

<p>It should be possible for someone else to learn how to use your
program or to use a function in your library by reading the comments
(and self-help, if provided) without reading the code.</p>

<p>All function comments should describe the intended API behaviour using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Description of the function.</li>
  <li>Globals: List of global variables used and modified.</li>
  <li>Arguments: Arguments taken.</li>
  <li>Outputs: Output to STDOUT or STDERR.</li>
  <li>Returns: Returned values other than the default exit status of the
last command run.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#######################################</span>
<span># Cleanup files from the backup directory.</span>
<span># Globals:</span>
<span>#   BACKUP_DIR</span>
<span>#   ORACLE_SID</span>
<span># Arguments:</span>
<span>#   None</span>
<span>#######################################</span>
<span>function </span>cleanup<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  …
<span>}</span>

<span>#######################################</span>
<span># Get configuration directory.</span>
<span># Globals:</span>
<span>#   SOMEDIR</span>
<span># Arguments:</span>
<span>#   None</span>
<span># Outputs:</span>
<span>#   Writes location to stdout</span>
<span>#######################################</span>
<span>function </span>get_dir<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>SOMEDIR</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#######################################</span>
<span># Delete a file in a sophisticated manner.</span>
<span># Arguments:</span>
<span>#   File to delete, a path.</span>
<span># Returns:</span>
<span>#   0 if thing was deleted, non-zero on error.</span>
<span>#######################################</span>
<span>function </span>del_thing<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your
code.</p>

<p>This follows general Google coding comment practice. Don’t comment
everything. If there’s a complex algorithm or you’re doing something
out of the ordinary, put a short comment in.</p>





<p>Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect.</p>

<p>This matches the convention in the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#TODO_Comments">C++ Guide</a>.</p>

<p><code>TODO</code>s should include the string <code>TODO</code> in all
caps, followed by the name, e-mail address, or other identifier of the person
with the best context about the problem referenced by
the <code>TODO</code>. The main purpose is to have a consistent
<code>TODO</code> that can be searched to find out how to get more
details upon request. A <code>TODO</code> is not a commitment that the
person referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create a
<code>TODO</code> , it is
almost always your
name that is given.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># TODO(mrmonkey): Handle the unlikely edge cases (bug ####)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>

<p>While you should follow the style that’s already there for files that
you’re modifying, the following are required for any new code.</p>



<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>

<p>Indent 2 spaces. No tabs.</p>

<p>Use blank lines between blocks to improve readability. Indentation is
two spaces. Whatever you do, don’t use tabs. For existing files, stay
faithful to the existing indentation.</p>



<h3 id="line-length-and-long-strings">Line Length and Long Strings</h3>

<p>Maximum line length is 80 characters.</p>

<p>If you have to write strings that are longer than 80 characters, this
should be done with a here document or an embedded newline if
possible. Literal strings that have to be longer than 80 chars and
can’t sensibly be split are ok, but it’s strongly preferred to find a
way to make it shorter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># DO use 'here document's</span>
<span>cat</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>END</span><span>
I am an exceptionally long
string.
</span><span>END

</span><span># Embedded newlines are ok too</span>
<span>long_string</span><span>=</span><span>"I am an exceptionally
long string."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<h3 id="pipelines">Pipelines</h3>

<p>Pipelines should be split one per line if they don’t all fit on one
line.</p>

<p>If a pipeline all fits on one line, it should be on one line.</p>

<p>If not, it should be split at one pipe segment per line with the pipe
on the newline and a 2 space indent for the next section of the pipe.
This applies to a chain of commands combined using <code>|</code> as well as to
logical compounds using <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># All fits on one line</span>
command1 | command2

<span># Long commands</span>
command1 <span>\</span>
  | command2 <span>\</span>
  | command3 <span>\</span>
  | command4
</code></pre></div></div>



<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>

<p>Put <code>; do</code> and <code>; then</code> on the same line as the
<code>while</code>, <code>for</code> or <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>Loops in shell are a bit different, but we follow the same principles
as with braces when declaring functions. That is: <code>; then</code>
and <code>; do</code> should be on the same line as the if/for/while.
<code>else</code> should be on its own line and closing statements
should be on their own line vertically aligned with the opening
statement.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># If inside a function, consider declaring the loop variable as</span>
<span># a local to avoid it leaking into the global environment:</span>
<span># local dir</span>
<span>for </span><span>dir </span><span>in</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dirs_to_cleanup</span><span>[@]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>do
  if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>-d</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>log_date <span>"Cleaning up old files in </span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>/"</span><span>*</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>((</span> <span>$?</span> <span>!=</span> 0 <span>))</span><span>;</span> <span>then
      </span>error_message
    <span>fi
  else
    </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>((</span> <span>$?</span> <span>!=</span> 0 <span>))</span><span>;</span> <span>then
      </span>error_message
    <span>fi
  fi
done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<h3 id="case-statement">Case statement</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Indent alternatives by 2 spaces.</li>
  <li>A one-line alternative needs a space after the close parenthesis of
the pattern and before the <code>;;</code>.</li>
  <li>Long or multi-command alternatives should be split over multiple
lines with the pattern, actions, and <code>;;</code> on separate
lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>The matching expressions are indented one level from the <code>case</code> and <code>esac</code>.
Multiline actions are indented another level. In general, there is no need to
quote match expressions. Pattern expressions should not be preceded by an open
parenthesis. Avoid the <code>;&amp;</code> and <code>;;&amp;</code> notations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>expression</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>in
  </span>a<span>)</span>
    <span>variable</span><span>=</span><span>"…"</span>
    some_command <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>variable</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>other_expr</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> …
    <span>;;</span>
  absolute<span>)</span>
    <span>actions</span><span>=</span><span>"relative"</span>
    another_command <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>actions</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>other_expr</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> …
    <span>;;</span>
  <span>*</span><span>)</span>
    error <span>"Unexpected expression '</span><span>${</span><span>expression</span><span>}</span><span>'"</span>
    <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simple commands may be put on the same line as the pattern <i>and</i>
<code>;;</code> as long as the expression remains readable. This is
often appropriate for single-letter option processing. When the
actions don’t fit on a single line, put the pattern on a line on its
own, then the actions, then <code>;;</code> also on a line of its own.
When on the same line as the actions, use a space after the close
parenthesis of the pattern and another before …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Cold email outreach is one of the most effective ways of boosting your exposure online. Numerous fortune 500 companies have successfully utilized it in a number of different ways. One of the least talked about aspects of a successful campaign is the preparation needed to do beforehand with the inboxes you plan on sending out mail from. This process is typically referred to as ‘warming up’ an inbox, where you take a brand new email address under your domain and get it prepared to send out a large amount of emails. In this blog post we will be going over all the basics about what this process is, how it works, and why doing so is an important step to perform for any type of cold email campaign. Let's get started.</p><h2 id="what-is-warming-up-an-email">What Is Warming Up An Email?</h2><p>To put it basically, warming up an inbox is simply making a new email account appear to be active and in use by a real person through routinely checking your inbox, sending out emails to other existing addresses, and maintaining email/conversation threads. You are establishing a reputation for this email address that will increase the likelihood that your outreach messages land in the primary inbox of the recipient and not get stopped by spam traps.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-necessary">Why Is This Necessary?</h2><p>The primary reason as to why fresh accounts need to be warmed up is that spammers will constantly be creating new accounts to utilize for their own spam outreach, where they typically get disabled, banned, or blacklisted quickly. This tactic existing within the spam industry has the negative effect on anyone performing an outreach campaign of their own, as one of the red flags for an email getting marked as spam is if it was recently created and does not have any type of reputation associated with it yet.</p><p>Warming up an inbox takes time and patients, but this effort will demonstrate to other mailboxes that this webserver is the real deal and any type of outreach you are performing is not malicious in any way. This will in turn increase your</p><ul><li>Rate of Delivery</li><li>Open Rates</li><li>Click Through Rates</li><li>Positive Engagement rates</li></ul><p>Essentially every aspect of your campaign has a better chance at success when you properly warm up an inbox. This also will drastically decrease the likelihood of an inbox being locked or flagged for violating any TOS under an email service.</p><h2 id="how-long-does-it-take">How Long Does It Take?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/calendar-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/calendar-1.png 600w, https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/calendar-1.png 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>It's important to maintain a time table for warming up an inbox.</figcaption></figure><p>Warming up an inbox is a long process that cannot be done in a single day or even over the course of a week. Based on past experiences we have had warming up inboxes, the sweet spot appears to be around 2 weeks of work to get an email address ready to be used in a cold email campaign.</p><p>Thankfully, this process is more about maintaining a schedule in which you are performing actions that will demonstrate activity rather than having to dedicate multiple hours every day towards this task. Later on we'll go over the specifics of how you should go about planning out your schedule, but keep in mind that the more time you perform actions to warm up an inbox, the better your reputation will be for the account.</p><h2 id="1-setting-up-the-basics-of-an-address">1: Setting Up The Basics Of An Address</h2><p>After the creation of a new email address, there are a few quick and simple steps that you should follow to establish a baseline identity for the account. The first thing you should do is set up a proper ‘from line’ and signature.</p><p>The from line of an address is what appears right next to the subject line of a piece of mail in a recipients inbox. Typically for personal email addresses, the from line of their account will be their first name + last name, since if you are sending out an email to another individual or business you would want the recipient to know who this email is from without having to guess based on the address itself. For an email account that you are using for cold email outreach, what you set the from line too is entirely dependent on the identity you are going with for this account. For most companies, the identity for an address will either be</p><ul><li>A personalized email with the identity of either a real or fake person at the company</li><li>A role based identity similar to an info@/contact@ address.</li></ul><p>Having a personalized email account when reaching out to contacts is typically the approach I would personally go with, as people are generally much more receptive when they feel like there is a real person on the other end instead of an address where the identity of the sender is not directly obvious. Whatever your purpose is for an email address being used for cold email outreach, you will want to configure your from line accordingly as it adds to the legitimacy of an address as well as will make your outreach attempts appear more legitimate.</p><p>The signature of an email address is what appears as a footer in mail sent to recipients. They will typically appear like this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U5Hrwq8A0fD8X8BBXVABh6OSijqLDu1XuZ2Yi2bwndYYAVABTYbYMI9Yj5QyjS2tufg10Co_QBmnaJRW5mCLKEfelhv-ijuNK9cO0J4Gcfpz1uXsThXss_MVcwbkFuXlnz1FjcJC" alt=""><figcaption>Example of an Email Signature</figcaption></figure><p>I like to think of an email signature in the same way you would a business card, where you essentially place all the relevant information and contact information you can into a small, compact space. This not only adds to the legitimacy of your new email address but also can be used to provide additional information regarding your company and the identity you are setting for this address.</p><p>Performing these two tasks after creating an account will not take much time, but go a long way for building up the legitimacy of your address.</p><h2 id="2-configuring-your-spf-dkim-and-dmarc">2: Configuring Your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/server.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/server.png 600w, https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/server.png 665w"><figcaption>Setting up your web server can drastically increase your delivery metrics</figcaption></figure><p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These are acronyms that the average person probably hasn’t heard of but are extremely important for ensuring a successful email outreach campaign.These trio of terms refer to a set of email security protocols that ensure your domain is protected and ensure that emails sent out have a very low likelihood of ending up in the spam folder of the targets inbox. All three of these protocols are inter-related and work together, so it is very important to at least understand what they are, how they work, and how to configure them if you need to. If your company utilizes an IT service, &nbsp;these protocols are most likely already implemented but it is very important to verify that they are yourself. Let's explore each of these protocols.</p><h3 id="spf"><br>SPF</h3><p>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication technique that is designed to confirm the identity of sender addresses and prevent any forged mail from being sent on behalf of your sender domain. The SPF framework is what allows an organization to publish authorized mail servers for the purpose of further authentifying any incoming mail received by other mail servers.</p><p>On a mail server, an SPF Record is simply just a DNS record that is added to your domain. In this record, you simply just specify which IP addresses or hostnames are allowed to send mail under your specific domain.</p><h3 id="dkim">DKIM</h3><p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is another email authentication method that is designed to detect email spoofing, which is the process of creating outgoing mail with a forged sender address. DKIM works in tandem with SPF records in that it allows the receiving inbox to check the validity of a piece of mail that comes from a specific domain. This process is done through the process of attaching a digital signature linked to the domain, where the receiving inbox can match this signature with the public signature of the domain DNS. These signatures are not seen by the user but hide in the metadata of each piece of mail as they are only needed on the backend of the server.</p><p>In relation to SPF, DKIM essentially provides another level of authentication when sending and receiving mail as it just another security handshake to ensure that the mail that other servers are receiving is real and being sent from validated inboxes.</p><h3 id="dmarc">DMARC</h3><p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is the final common email authentication protocol that is designed to further verify mail being sent to an external inbox. DMARC acts as an extension to DKIM and SPF authentication protocols as it allows the administrative owner of a domain to enter a DNS record to specify what protocols are in effect on a domain so the server knows what to look for (As in if you have DKIM enabled on your end but not an SPF record, the DMARC DNS entry will specify this so that the receiving server will know to only check the DKIM signature.)</p><p><strong>3: Sending Out Individualized Emails</strong></p><p>The most important aspect of warming up an inbox is slowly sending out and receiving emails on a daily basis. This is the biggest indicator to email hosting services that an account is indeed being used by an actual person and not being created purely for the purpose of sending out mass mail. This is done in a relatively straightforward manner, where you obtain a number of emails (preferably existing contacts who know beforehand that they will be receiving mail from a fresh account) and simply reach out to them in an organic way. A thing to note is that you do not want to be sending out emails containing random characters, as that can be a clear indication that you are sending out some sort of spam. Even if your emails are different copy and pasted emails, they have to be legible in some way that makes sense if someone were to read them.</p><p>The ideal amount of emails you want to send out per day is around 10-20 per day, spread across a 24 hour period of time where you do not send more than 2 emails out per hour. An ideal workflow will look something like this.</p><ol><li>Send out 10-20 unique, individualized emails out (With subject lines, and content within the body) to existing inboxes per day.</li><li>Open and read all mail that gets received back to you (signing up for newsletters will help this).</li><li>Maintain conversation threads with unique mail received back to you (have receiving inboxes reply back to you will help a lot with this task).</li><li>Perform these steps daily for 2 weeks</li></ol><p>The sending limit is a general rule of thumb I follow as almost every hosting service has a limit …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Broadly speaking, <strong>composition is putting two or more different things together, and getting the same “kind” of thing — a combination of the inputs — as a result.</strong></p>
<p>The concrete meaning might depend on the context, so we’ll look at a few examples that come up in front-end JavaScript development.</p>
<h3><a href="#composition-in-math" id="composition-in-math">Composition in Math</a></h3><p>While math is somewhat unrelated to front-end development, it’s useful to recap the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mathematical definition</a> — if only to show where the term originates.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have two functions. One function is <code>y = 2 * x</code>, which doubles its argument. The other function is <code>y = x + 10</code>, which adds 10 to its argument.</p>
<p>If we put them together so that the output of one function is fed to the other function, we get <code>y = (2 * x) + 10</code>. This is an example of composition — we’ve “composed” this function out of two other functions. <strong>That’s all this term means.</strong></p>
<p>Note how composition of two functions gives us another function. It doesn’t give us something entirely different. As a result, we can keep composing it many times.</p>
<p>Composition is a broad term, but we will only use it when the result of putting things together is the same “kind” of thing — whether it’s a function, a component, etc.</p>
<h3><a href="#function-composition" id="function-composition">Function Composition</a></h3><p>Composition often comes up in the context of functional programming. There, it refers to the same concept as in mathematics, but expressed in code.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have code like this:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> date </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getDate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> text </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>date</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> label </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createLabel</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showLabel</span><span>(</span><span>label</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>There is some repetition to this code. A <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1216142369181093889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rhythm</a>, if you will. We take a thing, convert it to something else, take <em>that</em> thing, convert it to something else, and so on.</p>
<p>But can we go further and remove the repetition, leaving only the steps?</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> steps </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>  getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  showLabel</span></p><p><span></span><span>]</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Some might say this code is <a href="https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaner</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s write a function that we’ll call <code>runSteps</code> that applies each step one by one:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>runSteps</span><span>(</span><span>steps</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i </span><span>&lt;</span><span> steps</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> step </span><span>=</span><span> steps</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>step</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>With this function, our original code becomes:</p>

We could write a function that does this for us:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>runSteps</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    showLabel</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Or we could have a function — we’ll call it <code>pipe</code> — that <em>generates</em> our function:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> showDateLabel </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  showLabel</span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>This code does exactly the same thing, but we didn’t have to explicitly implement <code>showDateLabel</code> (which merely called <code>runSteps</code>). We’ve <a href="https://whatthefuck.is/closure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tucked it away</a> inside <code>pipe</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>steps</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>runSteps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i </span><span>&lt;</span><span> steps</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>let</span><span> step </span><span>=</span><span> steps</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>step</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This reusable function lets us rewrite our code so that <strong>instead of manually calling functions one by one in a sequence, we only specify the steps</strong>. We called it <code>pipe</code> because it “pipes” the output of each previous function to the next one.</p>
<p>Recall our original code:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> date </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getDate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> text </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>date</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> label </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createLabel</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showLabel</span><span>(</span><span>label</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>And this is what it looks like with <code>pipe</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> showDateLabel </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  showLabel</span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>If you’re not sold on expressing everything using function composition, you might be wondering — what was the point? Why did we go through all of these steps? Isn’t the first example a bit more readable? Are you the only person not “getting” it?</p>
<h4><a href="#functional-eureka" id="functional-eureka">Functional Eureka</a></h4><p>Understanding <code>pipe</code> and function composition for the first time is a lightbulb moment. We don’t have to call our functions manually — instead, we can feed our functions to another function that will give us back a function to call our functions!</p>
<p>How “beautiful”.</p>
<p>There is definitely a profound insight there that we shouldn’t disregard. We have <em>raised the level of abstraction</em> by making the structure of our program itself — a sequence of steps — into something our code can manipulate. For example, we could teach <code>pipe</code> to wrap every step with some logging, or to run every step asynchronously. This is a powerful technique that deserves our understanding.</p>
<p>This programming style can also be a nightmare to work with. We’ve “outsourced” the actual business of function calls to helpers like <code>pipe</code>, and as a result we can no longer clearly see how each piece of data flows in and out of our functions because it all happens inside of <code>pipe</code>. We’ve added a piece of “indirection” — our code is more flexible, but less direct. Add too many layers, and <a href="https://overreacted.io/the-wet-codebase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our heads will overflow</a>.</p>
<p>While this programming style can be used with great success (especially in strongly typed languages that enforce <em>which</em> things can “fit” into other things), it’s a tad overused by enthusiastic programmers who get a dopamine rush from writing clever one-liners and hiding the control flow in “elegant” helpers. I did that, too.</p>
<h4><a href="#function-composition-is-neat-though" id="function-composition-is-neat-though">Function Composition Is Neat, Though</a></h4><p>That being said, the fundamental idea of function composition is important. Essentially, it means that when we have <code>doX(doY(doZ(thing)))</code>, we can <em>first</em> compose <code>doX</code>, <code>doY</code>, and <code>doZ</code>, and <em>then</em> apply the resulting function together.</p>
<p>In the trivial cases like above, using it directly brings more trouble than it’s worth. But it might get more useful if the problem is more challenging. Perhaps, we want each step to be <a href="https://whatthefuck.is/memoization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memoized</a>. Perhaps, each step happens asynchronously and the control flow is more complex. There can be cases where we want something to happen before or after each step, without repeating that fragile logic everywhere. Perhaps, the steps themselves need to be “interpreted” in different ways by our program, so we want to separate their order from how they are being executed.</p>
<p>Function composition can inspire interesting solutions if we keep it mind. This doesn’t mean that we need to take out a <code>pipe</code> every time we want to put two functions together. We don’t need to prove to the computer that we’re smart and learned our lessons about composition. Usually, plain function calls are enough.</p>
<h3><a href="#component-composition" id="component-composition">Component Composition</a></h3><p>Another context in which we might hear the word “composition” is related to declarative UI programming. We’ll take React components as an example.</p>
<p>React components render other components, all the way from <code>&lt;App&gt;</code> to a <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Screen</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Screen</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Form</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Form</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Button</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hey</span><span> there</span><span>.</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This is also called “composition” because we are putting things (components) into other things (components), and they fit with each other (“compose”) pretty well.</p>
<p>One interesting variant of composition is when a component has “slots”:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Layout</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> sidebar</span><span>,</span><span> content </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div className</span><span>=</span><span>"sidebar"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>sidebar</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div className</span><span>=</span><span>"content"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>content</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Then we can “fill in” those slots from different parent components:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>HomePage</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span><span></span></p><p><span>      sidebar</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HomeSidebar</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      content</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HomeContent</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>AboutPage</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span><span></span></p><p><span>      sidebar</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>AboutSidebar</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      content</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>AboutContent</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Note how these “slots” aren’t a special React feature. They are a consequence of our ability to pass down pieces of UI the same way we would pass any other data.</p>
<p>This is also called “composition” because we compose (“fill in”) <code>Layout</code> with different child components. Putting things inside other things.</p>
<h3><a href="#composition-vs-inheritance" id="composition-vs-inheritance">Composition vs Inheritance</a></h3><p>People sometimes say “composition” when contrasting it with inheritance. This has less to do with functions (which we’ve been discussing all along) and more to do with objects and classes — that is, with traditional object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>In particular, if you express your code as classes, it is tempting to reuse behavior from another class by extending it (inheritance). However, this makes it somewhat difficult to adjust the behavior later. For example, you may want to similarly reuse behavior from <em>another</em> class, but you can’t extend more than one base class.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people say that inheritance “locks you into” your first design because the cost of changing the class hierarchy later is too high. When people suggest <em>composition</em> is an alternative to inheritance, they mean that instead of extending a class, you can keep an instance of that class as a field. Then you can “delegate” to that instance when necessary, but you are also free to do something different.</p>
<p>Overall, the industry has largely moved away from modeling UI components as deep inheritance hierarchies, as was common in the 2000s.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean inheritance is always “bad”. But it is a very blunt tool, and it should be approached with moderation. In particular, inheritance hierarchies deeper than a few levels often cause problems that shallow inheritance doesn’t.</p>
<p>Modern front-end codebases rarely use inheritance for their UI because all of the popular UI libraries today feature powerful built-in support for composition. Say, in React, instead of extending a <code>Button</code>, you would <em>render</em> a <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code> in a parent component. Even JavaScript UI libraries that embrace classes typically don’t use inheritance as a way to reuse rendering code. And this is probably for the best.</p>
<h3><a href="#recap" id="recap">Recap</a></h3><p>To sum up, we say that we compose two things when we make a third thing out of them that is similarly shaped. The term has a mathematical meaning, and it is close to its meaning in functional programming. But the further we move away from pure functional programming, the less formal and more colloquial this term becomes.</p>
<p>Function composition is a powerful concept, but it raises the level of abstraction and makes your code less direct. If you write your code in a style that …</p></article></div>

		<p>I’ve never been good at what you might call “life admin”, but I used to keep track of it through having a high level of 1) recall, 2) guilt and anxiety.</p>
<p>I can’t say this system was working <em>well</em>, I was pretty behind on this stuff (such as… still having an Australian bank account five years after I moved away). But the critical things were mainly taken care of and the non-critical… remained in runtime memory.</p>
<p>A bit over a year ago, having dealt with what I termed the “inner monologue of self hate”, my every failing as a person was no longer running on a loop in every moment of downtime. At this point, I realised I needed a system that didn’t involve me remembering everything and worrying about it.</p>
<p>Enter: Trello.</p>
<h2>Board 1: Life Admin</h2>
<p>I created a board that I “jokingly” called “Life Failures” (since renamed to Life Admin), and set up a bunch of columns. I don’t exist kanban style in my life so the main features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of areas of responsibility, such as “finances”, “house”, “car” etc.</li>
<li>Labels, primarily: “waiting”, “work hours phone call”, “easy”, “blocking”. During lockdown I created a “post-pandemic” label to filter out visually the things I couldn’t expect to make progress on, which was helpful.</li>
<li>A done column that resets each month, i.e. “Done – June”, and “Done – July”. I tend to keep the previous month’s around and then archive when I create a new one. So right now in July, June is still around. When I create August, I will archive June.</li>
<li>Extensive use of checklists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each card is on some level a mini life “project”, and I keep tabs on things using the labels and the checklists. This is the one where I changed my bank account, it entered waiting / blocking states multiple times, was closed off in May, even though it began in March.</p>

<p>This sometimes creates a disconnect between the amount of work I’ve done and the amount I really get to “check off” but I am trying to embrace with this list the idea that life admin is something that is continually chipped away at. The goal is not to empty the board, the goal is to be more on top of things and not create cascading failure in my personal life (again).</p>
<p>Since adopting this system I’ve made progress on so many things that have dragged on for <em>years</em>. Particularly in the “financial” list which has always been my biggest struggle (there is no visual reminder, it’s extremely boring and usually bureaucratic which I find disproportionately stressful). The Australian bank account is closed, I <em>finally</em> managed to transfer my stock from the Conglomerate out of the mandated system and to my regular investment manager (this was so painful and had stopped and started multiple times before we really made a concerted effort earlier this year). I managed to untangle the mess of paying emergency tax for ~18+ months over three tax years. Addressing these things doesn’t really affect my day to day, but it does make it easier to make bigger decisions, because everything is accessible and where it should be.</p>

<p>The board is broad, and there are obvious ways to streamline it or break things out into their own board, but I choose not to. The board is broad because life is broad, and because some months I may move things from one column, and other months from other columns, the point is that everything is tracked, and moving overall.</p>
<p>List of columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>House</li>
<li>Car</li>
<li>Travel</li>
<li>Cate as a Person</li>
<li>Self-Employment</li>
<li>Professional</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Misc</li>
<li>Things to buy</li>
<li>Done – Current Month</li>
<li>Done – Previous Month</li>
</ul>
<h2>Board 2: Day to Day</h2>
<p>At the start of this year, I created a second board, which I call “Day to Day”. The idea of that one is to capture the repeating tasks. This consists of three lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week</li>
<li>Month</li>
<li>Current Month</li>
</ul>
<p>At any given time I have a “week” card which captures the things I try to do every week, and a “month” card which captures the things I try to do every month. When the week is up, I move it under the current month, and then I archive that at the end of the month. Initially I had “day” cards but I found that it was just annoying me, so I got rid of them.</p>
<p>I use template cards, so each time I create a new week or month card, they come with the same checklist. If I was going to add something, I would add it to the template card. For instance, I didn’t feel the need to track going to the gym on the week card because it was 1) more of a daily thing, and 2) a strong habit. After the gym being shut for nearly 4 months, I might add it in as I rebuild that habit.</p>
<p>This is the current state of the board:</p>

<p>The month list is relatively short, and really just captures 1) taking some time for myself (the spa!), 2) a task that I dread (the personal expense report) and 3) the vague thing that I feel is best done through continuous small efforts (the “external thing”, a profile building/maintaining exercise).</p>

<p>The week list is longer, and captures the aspects that I think create a well rounded life – good friendships (regular social interaction, doing something nice for other people), personal well being (writing, cultural experiences, regularly chipping away at the hardest list in life admin) and self care (making an effort with my appearance, maintaining a beautiful home). It’s always interesting what drops off depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>Initially I had the idea that these lists should capture everything, and had the concept of “extras” where I would note down things not covered by the list. But over time I’ve concluded that it works best for me when the concepts are general, and it creates regular opportunities to consider what, of the things I consider important, am I making time for? And what am I not?</p>
<h2>&nbsp;✅</h2>
<p>Both boards combine to address the nagging sense that I’m behind or not doing enough, and allow me to capture what goes into keeping my life moving along and the things make me happy. The things I “should” do no longer run in a loop in my head; they are captured in Trello, and it’s a vastly better way to live.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hopefully by now you have all upgraded to Element, with Android users leaving behind the old legacy Riot Android app. If you haven’t already been previewing it via RiotX (which has been in beta for a year now), it should hopefully feel like a game changer: as we said in our <a href="https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/">Welcome to Element</a> post, we’ve got more than just a rebrand going on here!</p><p>But let’s rewind a bit.</p><p>On the 12th of July 2019 (yep, just over a year ago), we <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-the-riotx-beta-for-android-b17952e8f771">released the very first version of what was a complete rewrite of the Riot Android app</a>. This was the beginning of a new era for us; where our UX is intuitive and polished, our apps are fast, and code is modern.</p><p>The step change was needed because, since it was launched in 2015, Riot Android (or Vector as it was called originally) had accumulated quite a lot of technical debt. After 8,113 commits and 1,270,939 changed lines of code, it was hard to maintain, and its limitations were starting to show in the user experience.</p><p>So off went the Android team, led by our UX team, setting up for a year-long marathon, and here goes the result!<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/a_BM-2Sm3GW9LUXoSZOcGIunaf2RvZZ-4PzP5_EnKfSprrJfmsZ3mUV2s3sUewNABgQ3PLwN2F5QTxB17X5CuQib4Zt8J3XrYnK7EAOuQYtbgPc0_6YAxoKE0IOvMN4D07WcHaVE" alt=""></figure><p>Element is built in Kotlin, rather than Java, so it has a much smaller and more maintainable codebase. It means we’re using all the latest Android frameworks (all the good stuff from <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack">jetpack/androidx</a>) and the latest approaches resulting in a clean architecture, well defined dataflows and a proper DB storage layer at last.</p><p>However, the biggest focus on Element Android has been on improving the user experience - throwing away all the stuff which evolved organically in Riot/Android, and replacing it with a user interface which was deliberately and methodically designed and implemented from the outset. Some of the biggest user-facing changes we’ve made for Element Android are:</p><h3 id="radically-simplifying-tabs-">Radically simplifying tabs.</h3><p>Riot previously had separate tabs for Home (showing all icons of your recent rooms on one page, complete with… opinionated horizontal scrolling), and then separate tabs for Favourites, People and Rooms, which duplicated the contents of the Home page, but adding in room previews. &nbsp;Finally, we had the Communities tab, letting you browse the users and rooms of the communities you’re in, which is a bit of a niche use case (especially given Communities need more love to fulfil their full potential in Element).</p><p>So we’ve simplified these five tabs into two: one for people (DMs), and one for rooms. &nbsp;There is no longer any duplication. &nbsp;Favourites sit at the top of the respective two lists, and you always get a one-line preview of the most recent activity in the room. &nbsp;Communities have become a side-panel you get at by tapping on your avatar, along with Settings.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/tabs.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tabs.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/tabs.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/tabs.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/tabs.jpg 2200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>This should be incredibly familiar to folks used to WhatsApp, Telegram or other messengers - and in fact is almost more simple. &nbsp;For power users, we’ve kept a secret ‘Notifications’ tab around too, which you can enable in Settings: Labs, which highlights the unread rooms, just to help you avoid missing any messages.</p><h3 id="reactions-edits-mentions-oh-my-">Reactions! Edits! Mentions! oh my!</h3><p>We’ve had the ability in Matrix to react to messages with emoji, edit messages, and @-mention people as a fancy embedded ‘pill’ for a while now - but poor Riot/Android users had to go without, as we implemented these on RiotX instead (given the last thing we wanted was to burn time implementing them on both codebases). &nbsp;But now RiotX is Element, the spell is broken and everyone can finally enjoy cross-platform reactions, edits and mention-pills!<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="way-better-voip-">Way better VoIP!</h3><p>The 1:1 voice and video calling in Element has been rewritten from scratch - complete with support for picture-in-picture for video calls!<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/voip.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/voip.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/voip.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/voip.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/voip.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="improved-notifications-">Improved notifications!</h3><p>At last, you can now properly set notification levels within the app by long pressing on the conversation in question. &nbsp;Notifications as a whole will get a massive overhaul in the near future, but this is a big step in the right direction.</p><h3 id="qr-scanning-and-cross-signing-for-device-verification-">QR scanning and cross-signing for device verification!</h3><p>We turned on <a href="https://blog.riot.im/e2e-encryption-by-default-cross-signing-is-here/">end-to-end encryption by default</a> back in May. This was possible due to massively improved user and device verification; supporting QR code scanning and emoji comparison for verification - as well as letting users verify their own devices at login, ensuring that they are then trusted by everyone else (“cross-signing”). &nbsp;Folks on Riot/Android were deprived of all of this goodness until Element landed. We hope you’re enjoying the simplicity of user verification relative to the bad old days of having to constantly manually verify everyone’s devices one by one…<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/qr.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/qr.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/qr.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/qr.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/qr.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="massively-improved-onboarding-">Massively improved onboarding.</h3><p>Last but not least, the experience of installing the app, registering, and subsequently logging in is massively improved. &nbsp;We’ve put a huge amount of effort into designing and polishing these flows - which are surprisingly fiddly to get right (especially when you’re decentralised and need to support multiple servers, and especially when you’re end-to-end encrypted and have to support things like cross-signing). &nbsp;The end result should speak for itself though: relative to the ugly old registration/login screen on Riot/Android, Element’s signup and login should feel like a whole new app!<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/onboarding.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="still-to-come-">Still to come.</h3><p>Now, the initial goal before turning the switch from Riot to Element was to get to a state where the features available in Riot Android were also available in Element.</p><p>To be honest, and you may have noticed, we didn’t get <em>completely</em> there and a few things are missing - but hopefully the new features and much better experience will make up for it as we push through finalising the last few things. You can check the remaining gaps between the two apps by looking up the “legacy-feature” tagged issues in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/projects/2">this dashboard</a>, but the biggest ones are probably the lack of integrated video conferencing (meaning that you’ll have to install the Jitsi app in order to do video conferences), and you won’t be able to send stickers yet. 1:1 voice and video calls work however. The other gaps are mostly related to settings - for example associate an email to your account, block/un-block devices, or the option to encrypt the messages only to verified devices - but these are coming soon.</p><p>For those who were using RiotX as the preview for this upgrade, heads up the app is not maintained anymore and will be removed from Google Play at the end of August, so if you haven’t heard the memo: <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app">please install Element</a>!! </strong></p><p>Element is even <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app/">available on Fdroid</a> already (and made it out before the Google Play version!💥). The ‘old’ Riot app will be deprecated in due course, joining Matrix Console on the nostalgic dusty shelf of memories... </p><p>Logically something can’t be simultaneously new and improved, but the new Element app is exactly that: breaking boundaries wherever it goes!</p><p>Please enjoy our brave new Android world 🤖🚀</p></div></div>]]>

But, until now, there has been little independent research published on their performance (both relative to each other and against state of the art open source models). We ran a standard dataset through all three tools to see how they stack up against each other.</p><p>If you are considering using computer vision services from Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure in your product (or you have trained an object detection model of your own and are wondering where you stand in comparison to AutoML) this is the post for you.</p><p>In this post, we review <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/">Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Azure Custom Vision</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl">Google Cloud AutoML Vision</a>. We'll weigh the pros/cons between them and we'll also compare them against results from <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5x</a>, a current-generation open source model.</p><p>We evaluate each product on the following factors:</p><ul><li>Training Time (how long to train the model)</li><li>Training Cost (how much to train the model)</li><li>Model Performance (how accurate is the model)</li><li>Inference Time (how long to predict on a test image)</li><li>Inference Costs (how much to predict once on a test image)</li></ul><p>We also provide insight into the major limitations of each platform and ease of use.</p><h3 id="summary-">Summary:</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg" alt="google cloud automl vs aws rekognition vs azure custom-vision" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>Our overall conclusion:</strong> AutoML tools are a great way to assess the feasibility of a computer vision project, even if you plan to eventually train a custom model architecture. Evaluating tradeoffs among the big three cloud providers depends on your project specifications (how important is inference speed; what accuracy threshold is required; what inference volume do you expect; what is the size of your dataset). Open source model architectures, while expensive to build and maintain, perform on par with big cloud provider options.</p><p>Unfortunately, each platform uses its own proprietary API and data format so it is very cumbersome to get started and compare solutions. Moreover, once you're up and running, you're locked in. (Luckily, <a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow</a> solves this by seamlessly integrating with all three.)</p><h2 id="overview-of-the-automl-process">Overview of the AutoML Process</h2><p>No matter which platform you choose, you will be entering a similar workflow to create and deploy your computer vision model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-54.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The AutoML Process in a diagram</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data Preparation</strong> - In order to train a computer vision model, you first need to acquire images that appear in your domain of interest. The narrower you keep your domain the better your model will perform. Then, your images will need to be labeled providing supervision to train your model to learn the vision concepts in question.</p><p><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong> - you will kick of training, a process where the computer formulates an algorithm based on training images to apply to images that it has never seen. Your model will then be evaluated based on how well it performs during predictions. This may be an iterative process as you add data and adjust training length. </p><p><strong>Model Deployment and Inference - </strong>Once you have a suitable model, you will deploy this model to a compute instance and stand up an API endpoint that you can hit to receive predictions based on what your model is seeing in your production images. </p><p>The cloud providers separate data labeling from AutoML, and we will be focusing on reviewing the AutoML service in this post, <strong>assuming you have already collected a labeled dataset.</strong></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-ms-coco">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - MS COCO</h2><p>The original plan was to benchmark these services on the modern standard, the <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">Microsoft Common Objects in Context Object Detection</a> (COCO) dataset.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>all three tools failed this challenge</strong> and we were unable to complete training on COCO.</p><p><strong>Rekognition Custom Labels</strong><em> -</em> has a hard-cap on the maximum training time of 72 node-hours per job. If your dataset takes longer than that to converge, the job will time out. Rekognition did not complete the MS COCO job before its time limit was exceeded and, thus, failed our test. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/limits.html">Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML</strong> - there was a limit of 100MB for annotation upload. We were able to work around this by splitting the file into several chunks but the estimated budget for training MS COCO on Google Cloud AutoML was $6000. Sorry, but there's no way we're spending that on a blog post... <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/object-detection/quotas">Quotas and Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision</strong> - maxes out at 100,000 training images (COCO has over 200,000). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/limits-and-quotas">Limits and Quotas Page</a></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-pascal-voc">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - Pascal VOC</h2><p>In order to compare the accuracy of AutoML vision solutions, we fell back to an older benchmark object detection task, the<a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/"> Pascal VOC 2012 Object Detection dataset</a>.</p><p><strong>The object detection task - </strong>Object detection challenges the computer to learn to draw bounding boxes around objects belonging to collection of object classes of interest.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-55.png" alt=""><figcaption>Azure Custom Vision displays an image in Pascal VOC</figcaption></figure><p>The Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has 13,690 training images and 3,428 validation images across 20 object classes.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-56.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-56.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png 1324w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The class distribution for the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset (via <a href="https://docs.roboflow.ai/dataset-health-check">Roboflow Dataset Health Check</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Pascal VOC withholds the dataset's test set so we evaluate the cloud platforms with their performance on the validation set.</p><h2 id="training-costs">Training Costs</h2><p>Once you have loaded your dataset into Amazon Rekognition, Google Cloud AutoML Vision, or Azure Custom Vision, you are ready to train your model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-57.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-57.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png 1449w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Kicking off training on Pascal VOC in Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</figcaption></figure><p>Training a model is a computationally intensive task, as the computer iterates through your dataset it will be optimizing millions of neural network parameters. To do this efficiently, the AutoML services will boot up GPU nodes.</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Cost - </strong>Training is started and runs until the model has reached maximum performance. You are unable to control how long training occurs for. Training costs $1/hr/instance and Amazon may provision multiple compute instances to train your model. So your training job may complete in two hours but you will be billed for more if more instances were started. Training can run for a maximum of 72 node hours. If it times out, your training cost is refunded. Be careful, you cannot stop training jobs that have started! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Cost - </strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision trains their model with 8 nodes with Tesla V100 GPUs. Each node hour is $3.15/hr, so ~$25 per wall clock hour. AutoML Vision allows you the ability to start, stop, and resume model training, which can be nice to anticipate the costs before the training job has started. There is no limit to the amount of training time you can provision in Google Cloud AutoML Vision. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/pricing">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Cost - </strong>Azure Custom Vision is less verbose in explaining their training costs - it costs $20/compute hour, but the underlying hardware is undisclosed so it is unclear how this stacks up against the Google and Amazon price/performance. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><h2 id="training-time">Training Time</h2><p>It is hard to benchmark training costs without factoring in training time. Each service may be running a larger or smaller model architecture, and may have varying levels of training time software optimization.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--10-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Waiting for training to complete in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>When starting your training job, you have the ability to choose between large or compact models based on your downstream inference time needs in Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon Rekognition just provides one size fits all. </p><p>Smaller models train faster, infer faster, but perform less well.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-59.png" alt=""><figcaption>Choosing model size in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>In this face off, we optimized all models for accuracy (and tried to train with a similar budget).</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Time- </strong>Rekognition completed the training job on the Pascal VOC 2012 training set in 26 node hours, costing $26. To make a fair comparison, we sought to use this as our training budget across platforms.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Time - </strong>To stick with with the Rekognition training cost baseline, we would need to use 9 node hours in Google Cloud AutoML Vision, but the minimum time allowed was 20 hours for our PascalVOC 2012 dataset, costing $60.

                <div>
                    <p>Emulator development has never been simple, but contemporary emulators face a tremendous set of challenges created by the modern era. Having witnessed some of the trials developers have gone through personally, I feel it's necessary to try and give an idea of what I've seen and my perspective on the situation. Some of the following topics are rather touchy, so please try to keep an open mind while reading.</p><h2 id="my-short-history-within-emulation">My Short History Within Emulation</h2><p>I joined the emulation development community mid-2013. Compared to many of the stalwarts of emulation I've met throughout the years, I'm a mere toddler. I'm not a coder and I'm definitely not a genius. I'm just a busy body that tests games and likes to write articles.</p><p>What invited me into emulation was <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a> and the idea of fixing up netplay so that we could get games like Super Smash Bros. Melee working consistently on netplay. With help from my brother, who is an accomplished software engineer now, we worked on netplay issues, asked developers questions, and even released our own modified builds with the goal of eventually getting our changes merged into master. </p><p>Our branch was never fully finished, but others joined the cause and netplay saw great improvements from many developers. Nowadays, the situation is far beyond my wildest dreams, and I can play pretty much any game I want on Dolphin's netplay. There are entire communities built around Dolphin's netplay, including websites like <a href="https://www.smashladder.com/">smashladder</a> which are far beyond the ambitions I held back in the day.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/GALE01-2.png"><figcaption>Back in 2012/2013, working netplay was little more than a pipe-dream.</figcaption></figure><p>During my work on Dolphin netplay, I realized I really enjoyed working on Dolphin and testing these games. There was something cathartic about digging into a game and figuring out what it was doing, how it was doing it, and how Dolphin was emulating it. The feeling of accomplishment when you finally <em>get it</em> and figure out what's going wrong is incredibly powerful.</p><p>Through constant testing, I began to build up my now encyclopedic knowledge of weird game behaviors and how Dolphin handles them that I have today. That knowledge would then come into play as I became one of the writers on the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/series%23series-1">Dolphin Progress Reports</a>. Thanks to the patience and kindness of developers, I know Dolphin well enough to write <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2016/09/06/booting-the-final-gc-game/">full length articles on hardware, how games take advantage of that hardware, and what makes things more difficult to emulate.</a></p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/finalgcgameheader.jpg"><figcaption>Learning enough about the GameCube MMU to write about Dynamic BATs was incredibly difficult.</figcaption></figure><p>It may not seem all that surprising nowadays, but back then I never thought it'd be possible to contribute to an emulator as a non-coder. But other skills come into play, and I've contributed to projects like <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a>, <a href="http://mgba.io/">mGBA</a>, <a href="https://citra-emu.org/">Citra</a>, <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/">yuzu</a>, <a href="https://rpcs3.net/">RPCS3</a>, and others. Dolphin itself has definitely influenced the community on the whole as the idea of <em>Progress Report </em>style monthly updates and blog teams have become fairly common.</p><hr><h2 id="the-core-emulator-team-open-source-and-forks">The Core Emulator Team, Open Source and Forks</h2><p>Since the Nintendo 64 and PSX era, emulation development has become about collaboration. The paradigm quickly shifted from plugin based emulators to open source emulators and that's where things have mostly settled for over a decade. After all, open source offers what one would think to be the ultimate advantage of allowing anyone with any skill set to look at the emulator and modify it.</p><p>Regardless of how many contributors a project has, there tends to be a core emulation team that manages the project. Some are more active in development than others, but they all care deeply about the project and will often weigh in on decisions and fight against or for particular changes. While everyone wants to improve the emulator, the core team can deeply affect the direction of the project.</p><p>A strong core team and good decision making is the key to keep a project maintainable and active. Considering that the <em>master branches</em> are the ones that most people contribute to and fork off of, it's especially important to make responsible decisions for the health of the emulator and community on the whole.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/MastervsFork-1.png"><figcaption>Commit history comparison between Dolphin (left) and Ishiiruka (right). Dolphin has a cleaner commit history to show exactly what every change does for people who want to modify Dolphin. Ishiiruka is developed by a few people who are familiar with their changes and thus don't need to spend as much time documenting them.</figcaption></figure><p>There are actually thousands of forks of Dolphin that are based off of this master branch. While the core developers are very careful about what gets merged into master, people can do whatever they want with their own fork, resulting in many specialized versions of Dolphin.</p><p>When open source works, the results can be incredible. Anyone can fix, create, or implement anything while having unparalleled access to the internals of the emulator and the software it can run. You don't even need programming experience to contribute, with many people contributing through services like <a href="https://www.transifex.com/">transifex</a> to help translate and increase accessibility of emulators around the world.</p><hr><h2 id="a-new-generation-of-open-source-emulation">A New Generation of Open Source Emulation</h2><p>I was introduced to Citra long before its initial public release. Since developers worked with me for the blog, I had a bit of an inside line on things they were working on. So imagine my excitement when one of the developers showed me the beginnings of a 3DS emulator as it booted its first game!</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/EarlyCitra.png"><figcaption>This image dates back to 2014, right around when Citra was announced and prompted much excitement.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, Dolphin's Progress Reports had become extremely popular with users and this new emulator, Citra, wanted to do a similar thing. For me? It seemed like a match made in heaven. Unlike Dolphin where I joined it as a fairly mature emulator, I'd be with this one from day one. I was one of the only non-coders within their development channels before the initial announcement.</p><p>Everything at the beginning was exciting with Citra. It felt like this new project with new games to test and new bugs to discover, report, and write about. The first few months went by at a crazy pace, with performance, compatibility, and feature-set expanding at an incredible rate.</p><p>Yet, something was off about the project. I didn't know exactly what, but, I didn't have the same devotion toward it that I did Dolphin. Part of the problem actually had to do with me. I had become specialized to how Dolphin worked through years of testing and working with developers. I didn't put forth enough effort to learn about Citra and developers were too busy still discovering new things about the 3DS to waste time walking someone like me through concepts that would normally be far beyond me.</p><p>In the articles and videos that I did make, I was rather vague because I didn't quite understand how things work. I would constantly compare things to how Dolphin worked, because that was my only frame of reference.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XFcTqoZ3nk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The thumbnail to this video should say everything you need to know.</figcaption></figure><p>If things had proceeded normally and Citra stabilized like Dolphin did, I probably would have adjusted and eventually figured things out. Unfortunately, I didn't last quite that long with the project.</p><h3 id="a-userbase-at-war-with-developers">A Userbase At War with Developers</h3><p>One core thing to remember is that developers care about their projects. While some of the minute details may vary, in the end most of the people working in emulation are working to preserve hardware and/or games in their own ways. It doesn't matter if that means working on the ultimate enhancements, pixel perfect accuracy, or improving performance - they all care.</p><p>Some users don't seem to understand that. They seem to think that these emulators are purposefully crashing or too slow just to frustrate them. That their Pentium IV is newer than a GameCube, and thus should be able to emulate a GameCube regardless of what these people who have worked on this emulator for decades say.</p><p>That isn't to say users are bad. Users are necessary as many of these emulators support giant libraries of games. They report bugs that developers would never know about otherwise, and some of those users fix the bugs themselves and join the project as a new developer!</p><p>I know it's wrong, but, I've lost my temper many times when working within the support forums. I understand that many of these users just want to load up their favorite game and have it work. When you deal with thousands of reports, even if only 10% of them are problematic, they start to weight on you.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/Android-1.png"><figcaption>Users like this are fairly rare on Dolphin's forums but became the normal for Citra for a time.</figcaption></figure><p>Working on Citra's social media and forums was an absolute nightmare because it seemed like <em>everyone </em>hated us. The desires of the userbase and developers shifted so far apart that it bred vicious malcontent and distrust. Before you could even answer a question on a thread, another user would have already replied that the developers don't care. It didn't matter if it was on reddit, facebook, chat logs, or anywhere else, it felt like users hated us.</p><p>What caused this massive divide? Because users wanted to play Pokémon <em>now. </em>Okay, that's a slight exaggeration, it wasn't just Pokémon, compatibility with a few popular games was slow in Citra due to some rather difficult features to emulate that they relied on. Pokémon fans only stood out because they were the most vocal of the annoyed fanbases.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/Comments.png"><figcaption>Even when unrelated features were posted, users were pretty adamant about the things they wanted.</figcaption></figure><p>Early on in Citra it started out with just asking for the games to boot, but the longer things went, the more tense things became. Simple questions became more annoyed as they disregarded the projects efforts until this one, single, thing was supported.</p><p>I don't know if they thought that downplaying everything they didn't care about would move developers toward something they wanted, but it had the effect of making it harder to work …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Getting a calmer and more data informed digest can help you  stay in the loop without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>A dashboard can be one such informational digest, but there are some challenges to making this happen. Creating a live updating dashboard usually involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data acquisition: <em>writing code</em> (usually in Python or R) to query a COVID data API on some regular interval.</li>
<li>Data cleaning: <em>writing code</em> to prep and transform the data for visualization.</li>
<li>Data storage: <em>writing code</em> to store the data in a database or data store of some kind.</li>
<li>Data visualization: <em>writing code</em> to specify how the data should be visualized.</li>
<li>Deployment: <em>writing code</em> to deploy your pipeline, database, and dashboard to the cloud.</li>

<p>In this post, we'll discuss an alternative way to build data dashboards very quickly. Essentially, we can use Google Sheets to handle the data acquisition, cleaning, and storage part of the pipeline and use Apache Superset to handle visualization and deployment.</p>

<p><a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Apache Superset</a> is an open source dashboarding tool that <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#database-dependencies">supports most databases and data engines</a>. Traditionally, Superset users integrate with one of the supported data stores and have to jump through the code-heavy process described earlier. However, <a href="https://github.com/betodealmeida">Beto Dealmeida's</a> excellent work on the <a href="https://github.com/betodealmeida/gsheets-db-api">gsheets-db-api</a> plugin lets us empower Superset to talk to Google Sheets. <em>(Note: under the hood, Superset saves the data in it's local SQLite instance).</em></p>
<p>To complete this tutorial, you'll need 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Google account to create your Google Sheets</li>
<li>an instance of Apache Superset (installation is quick using Docker -- <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-05-11-getting-started-installing-superset/">instructions here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard way to interface with data hosted on another website is through a REST <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>. API's provide a clean, programmatic way to send or receive data with other web services without needing to understand <em>how those services work</em>. The meteoric rise in web services in the last decade has caused some to declare that API's are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/apis-fuel-the-software-thats-eating-the-world/#:~:text=Marc%20Andreessen%20once%20famously%20said,the%20rapid%20creation%20of%20software.&amp;text=All%20of%20this%20is%20made,into%20a%20world%20of%20services.">eating the world</a>.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://covid19api.com/">covid19api.com</a> provides an API that returns the latest COVID data when you send a <a href="https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/"><strong>GET</strong> request</a>. </p>

<p>Out of the box, Google Sheets doesn't know how to request data from an API like this nor does it know how to handle the common data type that's returned (which is <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>). Thankfully, Google has added <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">support for running custom scripts</a> that allow us to extend the functionality of products like Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The engineer <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper">Brad Jasper</a> has written and open-sourced an excellent script called <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON">ImportJSON</a> that we can add to Google Sheets. This script will expose functions like <code>ImportJSON()</code> that we can use as a spreadsheet formula to fetch JSON data from the COVID 19 API and correctly structure the data in spreadsheet form. </p>
<p>Before we geek out about the power of Brad's script, let's add it to Google Sheets. When we add a Google Apps Script, it's linked to a specific spreadsheet in Google Sheets. So first things first, create a new Google Sheet.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Delete the default code that's there, copy and paste the full text from <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON/blob/master/ImportJSON.gs">ImportJSON.gs</a>, and then save the script. Optionally, you can rename the <code>.gs</code> file to <code>ImportJSON.gs</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Create a new script by selecting <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Script file</strong>. Copy and paste the code from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/aborruso/68547b8df77423226bf7ac0b57d9b73e">code snippet</a> into the new script file and save it as <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code>.</p>

  </a></p></div></div>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. The last step is to rename the first sheet (found on the bottom bar) to <strong>Data</strong> and the second sheet to <strong>DoNotDelete</strong> (the <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code> script looks for this sheet name, so this one is important).</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-data-fetching-and-auto-refresh"><a href="#setting-up-data-fetching-and-auto-refresh" aria-label="setting up data fetching and auto refresh permalink"></a>Setting Up Data Fetching and Auto Refresh</h2>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>. Once you've added both the <code>ImportJSON.gs</code> and <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code> scripts, add the following formula to cell <strong>A1</strong> in the <strong>Data</strong> sheet.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>=ImportJSON("https://api.covid19api.com/summary", , )</code></pre></div>

  </span>
  </a></p></div></div>
<p>When you press Enter or click outside of the cell <strong>A1</strong>, Google Sheets will run the <code>ImportJSON()</code> function from <code>ImportJSON.gs</code> and display the text <strong>Loading..</strong> until it's done. This function:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes a <strong>GET</strong> request to our API of interest: <a href="https://api.covid19api.com/summary">https://api.covid19api.com/summary</a></li>
<li>parses the JSON data returned from the API</li>
<li>transforms the JSON data to tabular, spreadsheet data by making some assumptions on how that transformation should look</li>
<li>populates the spreadsheet with this transformed data</li>
</ul>
<p>If everything worked correctly, you should see the following data populated.</p>

  </span>
  </a></p>
<p>To make sure the COVID data is up to date, we need to setup Google Sheets to re-run the <code>ImportJSON()</code> code on some time interval. We can accomplish this using a time-based <strong>Trigger</strong> that runs the <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code> script on a schedule we specify (say every 1 hour or every 4 hours). </p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://gist.github.com/aborruso/68547b8df77423226bf7ac0b57d9b73e">code</a> for <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code>, you'll notice that it just sets the cell <strong>A1</strong> in the <strong>DoNotDelete</strong> tab to a random integer. When this value is updated, Google Sheets will also re-run all formulas in all tabs. This means that <code>=ImportJSON("https://api.covid19api.com/summary", , )</code> will run again and fetch the latest COVID data.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>. Navigate to <a href="https://script.google.com/">Google Scripts</a>, select <strong>ImportJSON</strong>, select the 3 dots on the right, and then select <strong>Triggers</strong>. </p>

  </span>
  </a></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>. Make your Google Sheet public so Superset can access it. </p>
<p>We are all setup now to create dashboards! If Google Sheets fails to run <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code>, it will email you. </p>
<h2 id="connecting-google-sheets-and-apache-superset"><a href="#connecting-google-sheets-and-apache-superset" aria-label="connecting google sheets and apache superset permalink"></a>Connecting Google Sheets and Apache Superset</h2>
<p>The last configuration step is to add this Google Sheet as a table in Apache Superset. Read our<a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-01-connect-superset-google-sheets/">tutorial post</a> on learn how to connect Google Sheets with Apache Superset.</p>
<p><strong>Two important things to note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each tab (sheet) in a Google Sheets document has a different URL (the URL is auto-updated in your browser when you switch tabs). When adding data sources to Superset, make sure you copy the URL corresponding to the sheet you want to work with.</li>
<li>The Google Sheets plugin for Superset sometimes fails to parse the header row properly when spreadsheet cells have formulas. To get around this, you should add <code>?headers=1</code> in the Google Sheets URL after <code>../edit</code>. Here's an example: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eXru_ib0h8c_WwRP4DNKeJg8alWtre9VpJx3Mqs1SrE/edit?headers=1#gid=1393498242">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eXru<em>ib0h8c</em>WwRP4DNKeJg8alWtre9VpJx3Mqs1SrE/edit?headers=1#gid=1393498242</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-charts"><a href="#creating-charts" aria-label="creating charts permalink"></a>Creating Charts</h2>
<p><strong>Step 10</strong>. In Superset, navigate to <strong>Sources &gt; Tables</strong> and select the table you just added that corresponds to the tab in Google Sheet you want Superset to query.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
Running queries against Google Sheets is significantly slower than
against a database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL so you should only use this
approach for smaller datasets.

No cluster creation, no maintenance, and you only pay for what you use. We will start by providing a context on why we think this is important, a brief introduction to a couple of concepts and then go directly into a use case.</p><p>Scaling Machine Learning models is hard and expensive. It is costly mainly for two reasons: because the infrastructure is expensive, and because your experimentation pipeline is slow causing your ML team to be constantly waiting for the results.</p><p>It is easy to underestimate how is expensive it is to have an ML team waiting for results. Not only because of the time wasted but also because people get frustrated and end up losing motivation.</p><p>One way to optimize your ML experimentation process it is to build and manage your own infrastructure. This is common in big companies, but this is often prohibitively expensive for smaller companies.</p><p>Traditional software development had similar challenges years ago, companies needed to scale, mainly driven by business needs (slow services/API/website don't scale). Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to provide services that allow companies to scale without upfront costs. They mainly approach this issue in two ways: services that are easier to manage and serverless services. The latter were particularly attractive for small companies that didn't have a big DevOps team or much money to pay for their own infrastructure.</p><p>A similar trend is happening in Machine Learning. This time is driven by the scarcity and high cost of ML talent. Like SW, small companies can't invest a huge amount of money to create a custom optimized infrastructure to ML, it requires a team of experts to build it and maintain it.</p><p>Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to add value similarly by providing Serverless solutions to ML. GCP, in particular, has done this for a while. GCP AI Platform offers different services for each stage of an ML project. But they also count on other services that can help solve ML challenges.</p><a id="what_is_dataflow?" href="#what_is_dataflow?"><h2>What is Dataflow?</h2></a><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a> is a fully managed processing service, that uses <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> as its programming model to define and execute pipelines. Dataflow is one of the <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/">many runners</a> that Beam supports.</p><blockquote><p>Apache Beam provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.</p></blockquote><p>Dataflow in particular has some interesting features:</p><ul><li>Fully managed</li><li>Autoscaling</li><li>Easy implementation</li></ul><a id="what_is_apache_beam?" href="#what_is_apache_beam?"><h2>What is Apache Beam?</h2></a><p>As mentioned above, Beam is a programming model used to define and execute a processing pipeline. It provides an interface to create a processing pipeline that can be executed in multiple environments (such as Spark, Hadoop, Dataflow).</p><a id="use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50" href="#use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50"></a><p>As Computer Vision engineers, we often need to extract embeddings using a CNN model. Here we will present how to build a Dataflow pipeline that generates image feature embedding using a pre-trained ResNet50. Our pipeline will consist of 3 simple steps:</p><ol><li>Load images</li><li>Extract features</li><li>Store features</li></ol><p>To implement our pipeline we are going to use the Apache Beam Python SDK, Keras, Pillow, and Click. Because we will use non-python dependencies we have to structure our code as it is described <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#nonpython">here</a>.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is create a pipeline configuration:</p><pre><pre><code>if local:
    # Execute pipeline in your local machine.
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DirectRunner",
    }
else:
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DataflowRunner",
        "temp_location": "...",
        "staging_location.": "...",
        "max_num_workers": max_num_workers,
    }

options = PipelineOptions(
      project=project_id,
      job_name=job_name,
      region=region,
      **runner_options
  )

options.view_as(SetupOptions).save_main_session = True
options.view_as(SetupOptions).setup_file = os.path.join(
    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute(), "..", "setup.py")
</code></pre></pre><p>As you can see the options change depending on whether we are executing the pipeline locally or on Dataflow.</p><p>Then we need to create a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline">Pipeline</a>:</p><pre><pre><code>with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
        ...
</code></pre></pre><p><code>p</code> is our pipeline, to add new steps to the pipeline use the operator <code>|</code> as follow:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | Task();
</code></pre></pre><p>If you want to explicitly name the step you can use the operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code>:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | ("task_name" &gt;&gt; Task());
</code></pre></pre><p>And now we need to specify the steps for our pipeline. There are multiple ways to implement it:</p><ul><li>Built-in implementations: BigQuery connector, ReadFile, etc.</li><li>Custom implementation: Map, Filter, ParDo</li></ul><pre><pre><code>(p
 | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
 | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
 | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)
 | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
</code></pre></pre><p>Here you can see we have added the three steps mentioned above. We are loading the paths to the images from a CSV file in Google Cloud, then we load the images, extract their embedding, and store them in Google Cloud Storage.</p><p>In all the steps in our pipeline we expect to receive one input and return one output. To apply these type steps we must use the method <code>beam.Map</code>. Alternatively, If you are dealing with steps that could potentially receive/return zero or more inputs/outputs, you could use <code>beam.ParDo</code>.</p><p>Now that the pipeline is defined, let's take a look at implementations.</p><a id="loading_images" href="#loading_images"><h3>Loading images</h3></a><p>At this step, we need to download the image from GCS, load it as a Pillow Image, resize it, and convert it into a numpy array object. The reason why we download and resize in a single step, is that we want to reduce the data transferred between steps in the pipeline, thus decreasing the cost.</p><pre><pre><code>def load(path):
    """
    Receives an image path and returns a dictionary containing
    the image path and a resized version of the image as a np.array.
    """
    buf = GcsIO().open(path, mime_type="image/jpeg")
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(buf.read()))
    img = img.resize((IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH), Image.ANTIALIAS)
    return {"path": path, "image": np.array(img)}
</code></pre></pre><p>Beam provides a set of <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/">built-in Connector</a> to handle I/O.</p><a id="extracting_features" href="#extracting_features"><h3>Extracting features</h3></a><p>In this step, we need to load the ResNet model and run the predictions. To avoid loading the model multiple times on the same worker, a singleton wrapper was added to the <code>FeatureExtractor</code> class. Once we extract the embedding, we add it to the item dictionary, and as we do not longer need to have the full image loaded in memory, we remove it from dictionary.</p><pre><pre><code>def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]

    return get_instance

@singleton
class Extractor:
    """
    Extract image embeddings using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = ResNet50(
            input_shape=(IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, 3),
            include_top=False,
            weights="imagenet",
            pooling=None,
        )

    def extract(self, image):
        return self.model.predict(np.expand_dims(image, axis=0))[0]

def extract(item):
    """
    Extracts the feature embedding from item["image"].
    """
    extractor = Extractor()
    item["embedding"] = extractor.extract(item["image"])
    # We do not longer need the image, remove it from the dictonary to free memory.
    del item["image"]
    return item
</code></pre></pre><a id="storing_features" href="#storing_features"><h3>Storing features</h3></a><p>Now that we have the embedding we just need to store it in GCS.</p><pre><pre><code>def store(item, output_path):
    """
    Store the image embeddings item["embedding"] in GCS.
    """
    name = item["path"].split("/")[-1].split(".")[0]
    path = os.path.join(output_path, f"{name}.npy")

    fin = io.BytesIO()
    np.save(fin, item["embedding"])

    fout = beam.io.gcp.gcsio.GcsIO().open(path, mode="w")
    fin.seek(0)
    fout.write(fin.read())
</code></pre></pre><p>Dataflow allows you to specify the machine type, number of workers, objective, etc, providing a lot of flexibility to find the right configuration for the task at hand. You can check all the options <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">here</a>.</p><p>Once you run your Dataflow pipeline you will see logs about the status of the execution in your machine. Another alternative is to use Dataflow web UI. You can learn more about it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-monitoring-intf">on its doccumentation</a>.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/dataflow-pipeline.webp" alt="Dataflow UI"></p><p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/dataflow-demo">full code here</a>.</p><p>Apache Beam also supports branching your pipeline. Let's say you want to create 2D visualizations of your embedding, you can do this by branching your pipeline in the following way:</p><pre><pre><code>p = (
   p
     | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
     | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
     | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)))

(p | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
(p | "reduce_dim" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(reduce_dim))
</code></pre></pre><p>This allows Beam to execute <code>store</code> and <code>reduce_dim</code> independently, providing more flexibility to optimize the pipeline, and therefore improving its performance.</p><a id="scale" href="#scale"></a><p>Dataflow provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">multiple configurations</a> that allow you to customize the way you want to scale, in a really easy way. By default, it chooses the values that improve performance. During the execution itself, Dataflow changes the configuration to optimize the performance, changing, for instance, the number of workers, the machine type, etc.</p><p>You can let Dataflow find out what is the best configuration each time you run the pipeline. But if you already know what your jobs need, such as the amount of RAM, or whether it is CPU intensive, what is the maximum throughput supported by your external services (i.e.: your DB or API capacity), it is better to specify this information directly. This will help Dataflow converge faster into the right configuration, speeding up the executing and reducing costs.</p><p>Dataflow should be enough to cover most of small/medium size companies requirements to scale. To have a number as reference, Dataflow is able to execute the use case presented above at rate of 5k images per seconds, using up to 1k workers.

<p>It must be a Monday -- someone has trademarked "Infocom"!</p>
<p>No, this doesn't happen <em>every</em> Monday. But over the past twenty years, a surprising number of people have tried to register "Infocom" as a game-related trademark.</p>
<p>The original Infocom company trademarked their name in 1979. Activision purchased the company and the trademark in 1986. But, of course, the Infocom brand didn't last long after that. Activision allowed the trademark to lapse in 2002. (They let "Zork" lapse in 2003. Curiously, they renewed the trademark on "Return to Zork", which remains live today.)</p>
<p>This set off a weird slow-motion frenzy in which some Infocom fan or other would notice the dead trademark and try to do something with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oliver Klaeffling filed a registration in 2007. He posted a web page for a game called <em>Triumvirate</em>, apparently a fan-sequel to <em>Trinity</em>. (I <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2010/02/that-new-official-infocom-web-site.html">wrote about this in 2010</a>.) The game never appeared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.omniconsumerproductscorporation.com/">Omni Consumer Products</a> <em>also</em> filed a registration in 2007. This is a silly but real company run by Pete Hottelet. It sells real version of fictional products like Fight Club Soap and Stay Puft Marshmallows. Omni held onto the trademark until 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob Bates, one of the original Infocom folks, filed a registration in 2017. This was shortly after his <a href="https://www.thaumistry.com/">Thaumistry</a> kickstarter. The game shipped that year, but the trademark registration was not completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, just a few months ago, a company called <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/">SmartMonsters</a> has filed for it. </p>
<p>Interestingly, this registration only covers "online, non-downloadable" videogames. If you look at the <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/">SmartMonsters</a> site, you'll see that it runs a set of old-school MUDs. By old-school, I mean they are strongly oriented around RPG-style stats, skills, and XP. This is what all MUDs were like before the "social" TinyMUD/MUSH/MOO tree branched off.</p>
<p>One of their available games is a port of <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/Dungeon/Players/index.jsp">Dungeon</a>. It claims to be "mashed-up from several of the 1980s C ports". It's running in a MUD framework, but it's not multiplayer. It's also pretty alpha; I couldn't manage to take inventory or attack the troll.</p>
<p>The SmartMonsters people are clearly long-time MUD-and-IF folks. Their <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/Links/interactiveFiction.jsp">IF resources</a> page links to IFDB, the forum, and a bunch of classic games (including mine). Their <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/Welcome/CompanyInfo/index.jsp">bio page</a> describes co-founder Gary Smith as "...the guy who ported Zork from MDL to C on the PDP."</p>
<p>(I'll note that this is an unrecovered port! All the extant C versions of Zork/Dungeon are translated from Bob Supnik's Fortran version. I dropped SmartMonsters a note asking about it. They say Gary's C port is lost, but he might have a VisualBasic port lying around from the old days...)</p>
<p>I'm pleased to have stumbled across <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/">SmartMonsters</a>. But that's not the weird part of this story! There's <em>another</em> company trying to pick up the Infocom trademark right now. I'll post about them <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2020/07/trademarking-infocom-again-part-two.html">tomorrow</a>.</p>
<p>("How do you keep a dornbeast in suspense?")</p>

        <p><strong>Postman is a handy tool that can help you do full stack integration testing of your APIs. Learn how to use it without requiring any panic flips</strong>.</p>
<p>For all <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/importance-upstream-unit-testing/">the value of unit tests</a>, sometimes there’s no replacement for testing an entire application <em>in situ</em>. By <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-is-api-testing/">hitting your API endpoint in a running system</a>, in one fell swoop you can test the functionality of both your code and deployment integration. This philosophy is popular for <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-challenges-of-testing-guis/">web-facing applications</a>, with tools such as Selenium letting you exercise the functionality of your website, but similar tools are available for applications that can expose themselves via REST-style APIs.</p>
<p>Probably the most popular of these collaboration platforms for API development and testing is <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a>. Part of Postman’s popularity, no doubt, is because it has a free version, but it also has a lot of useful features and can scale to enterprise needs if you’re willing to fork out some dough.</p>
<p><em>But James</em>, I hear you say, <em>I can test my endpoints using wget or curl</em>! Yes, and you can also start a fire using two rocks. But when there’s a blowtorch sitting right there, wouldn’t you rather use it? (Note: The author in no way endorses using a blow torch to kindle a fire, and any claims that he does so regularly are base slander.)</p>
<p>The problem with poking at your API using command-line tools such as wget and curl is that APIs don’t live in isolation. Frequently, you need to pass the results of one REST call to the next. For example, consider endpoints protected by SSO authentication. You authenticate yourself on one endpoint, take the cookie it provides as a result, and then stick it in the header of subsequent requests to an entirely different endpoint. Yes, you can accomplish that using command-line tools and a bunch of intermediate “glue” code to extract the cookie and pass it on, but Postman basically lets you do it for free.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I show you how to use Postman to extract data from one API call and pass it forward to another. (I don’t tackle SSO, though.) For the purposes of demonstration and to appease my <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/77541/11-playful-pieces-pinball-slang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flipper-fixated</a> editor, herein I write some tests against the open-source <a href="https://pinballmap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PinballMap.com</a> REST API, which lets you access a crowdsourced map of public pinball machines.</p>
<p>To start, fire up Postman. Once the application is launched, we can prevent long-term headaches by creating an <em>environment</em>. An environment is a way to specify a bunch of attributes; you can easily change those attributes and settings by switching from one environment to another. This is handy when you need to switch among development, testing, and production endpoints with the same test suite. Rather than duplicating all the tests with three different endpoints, you can define a “host” variable with different values for each platform you test.</p>
<p>In this case, we only know the URL for the production endpoint, but let’s use an environment anyway to show how it’s done.<br>
<img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="520" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1.png 800w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1-768x499.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><br>
After we add this environment, the variable called “host” is available whenever this environment is selected. If we had other tiers to test against, we could create a “dev” or “test” environment using a different value.</p>
<p>Once the environment is squared away, it’s time to create a <em>collection</em>. Collections are groups of requests that you can string together into a suite of tests, passing values between them.</p>
<p>Collections can have their own variables. So, for example, you could define the common portion of the API URL in a variable and use it in requests. This can be handy if, say, your REST API incorporates a version number (as Pinball.com does). Put in the version number as a variable; when the API is bumped a version, you can test against the new one by changing the version in one place, rather than in every request.<br>

<p>Another nice feature of Postman is that you can define a collection’s authorization mechanism; then, whatever authentication you choose is carried over onto all the requests you make.</p>
<p>With our environment and collection set up, we’re finally ready to write some requests. We start by requesting a list of all the regions where there is pinball table data.<br>
<img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="507" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1.png 800w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1-300x190.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1-768x487.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>We include that “host” variable in the URL for the request, which is replaced with the value defined by our selected environment. When we send the request, we get back a boatload of data in JSON format, which Postman nicely pretty-prints for us. (You can get the raw view as well, should you want it.)</p>
<p>But we don’t just want to fetch the data. We want to test it, and we want to extract values to use for subsequent calls. That duty is fulfilled by the “Tests” tab, where you can plop in JavaScript. In this case, I wrote a simple status code sanity test and a piece of code to pull out the region name of the first record and put it in a variable.</p>
<pre>pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

let jsonData = pm.response.json()

postman.collectionVariables.set('regionname', jsonData.regions[0].name)</pre>
<p>The JSON tree can be walked the same way you’d access JSON data in any other JavaScript code.</p>
<p>You have a choice of scopes for your variables. In this case, we save it at the collection level, which means that it’s available to any other request in the collection. You can also save it as an environment variable, globally, or as even a temporary variable only available during the current test run. (The latter has the disadvantage that you can’t use it if you run the requests one by one, but it’s nice to know about.)</p>
<p>Now that we have a region name, we can get a list of all the locations in that region (which includes the tables available in that location). The URL for that request is:</p>
<pre>/api/v1/region/:region/locations.json</pre>
<p>To replace the “:region” segment with the region name we got from the first request, we create a new request with the URL:</p>
<pre>{{host}}/api/v1/region/{{regionname}}/locations.json</pre>
<p>The {{host}} portion is replaced with the variable we defined in our environment. The {{regionname}} comes out of the collection variable set in the previous request.<br>
<img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1.png 800w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1-300x188.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>That’s the start. You can continue to write further tests, exploring the JSON data and validating results. One critical thing to remember is that because we’re querying a live database, values can change over time. Your tests shouldn’t assume that any particular record will be returned as the results of a request. You should also remember that if you play the <em><u>Pirates of the Caribbean</u></em> machine at Antonio’s Pizza &amp; Pasta in Buelton, CA, it has a very weak left flipper.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In November of 2018 a malicious Javascript package was identified and subsequently removed from the NPM ecosystem. A nefarious modification was introduced into this package, <code>flatmap-stream</code>, which was then added as a direct dependency to the popular <code>event-stream</code> package - and downloaded nearly <strong>8 million</strong> times.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

Sign up to be notified when our beta opens goes live!</p><p><a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#signupModal"><span>Sign Up For <b>Free</b></span> Scan your dependencies</a></p></div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Unfortunately this is hardly an isolated event. In 2019 another package, <code>bb-builder</code>, was identified as malicious and removed from NPM. In 2020 over 700 Ruby gems were taken offline. So what can we learn from these types of attacks against the open source community? Software supply chain attacks are both common and extremely effective attack vectors against developers and their end users.</p><p>A newly published paper titled <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09535.pdf">The Backstabber's Knife Collection</a></em> recently made waves in the security community. This paper provides a great analysis across a broad spectrum of software supply chain attacks over the last few years. Not only have we seen a dramatic rise in these sorts of attacks (including some rather high profile breaches, such as the Magecart attacks targeting British Airways, among others), but there has also been a very lackluster response across the industry to the threats posed by these problems. This is a startling revelation considering that according to the Synopsys 2020 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis Report, the majority of commercial code bases across a broad spectrum of industries not only contained open source software, but were composed <em>mostly</em> of open source software. This means that across the board we have effectively given tens of thousands of unknown developers indirect write access to our source repositories with no checks, balances or governance and simply hoped for the best.</p><p>So what does a software supply chain attack look like? The incidents examined in the paper looked at several classes of issues: typosquatting, dependency injection, and repository compromise. </p><h3 id="what-is-typosquatting">What is typosquatting?</h3><p>Typosquatting comprised a bulk of the malware found. The whole idea behind this sort of attack is to take an existing package, add a backdoor to it and re-upload the package with a slightly different name (e.g. <code>raect</code> instead of <code>react</code>). Attackers performed a number of tricks in order to get their package downloaded by developers including: stealing the names of legitimate packages in new ecosystems, making blog posts encouraging the use of the imposter package, or simply hoping developers would mistype the package name.</p><p>Typosquatting has been a prevalent attack against users of NPM. In August of 2017 NPM identified a typosquatted package with a name very close to that of the popular <code>cross-env</code> package. NPM worked to remove this package, and in doing so, identified an additional 40 malicious packages that needed to be taken down.</p><h3 id="injecting-software-dependencies-upstream">Injecting software dependencies upstream</h3><p>In these cases, packages were added upstream from a major project and were able to infect a wide variety of packages downstream. This particular attack takes advantage of the fact that developers rarely investigate their dependencies past the few top level ones that they directly rely on.</p><h3 id="turning-packages-malicious-through-repository-compromise">Turning packages malicious through repository compromise</h3><p>Finally, there were a number of cases where package repositories themselves were compromised. This could happen for several reasons - in one case, the maintainer of a major package, used by thousands of downstream projects, quit, passing ownership of the package to a new maintainer. The new maintainer, having gained control of a very influential piece of the ecosystem, added a backdoor to the package. </p><p>Our independent analysis at Phylum has shown that across the board large centers of gravity exist within package ecosystems, where compromise of a single package may influence many thousands of projects downstream.</p><h3 id="how-do-we-mitigate-software-supply-chain-risks">How do we mitigate software supply chain risks? </h3><p>Since this is clearly a huge issue, what is currently being done about it? Shockingly, the answer is <em>nearly nothing</em>. This is especially interesting as many products now advertise into the space of threat detection and prevention within the software supply chain. However, the reality of the situation is that their focus is on simple threat intelligence feeds - data derived from painstaking manual analysis. An approach that is not only purely <em>reactive</em> rather than <em>proactive,</em> but also doomed to fail. The scope and scale of the data involved is simply too massive to manually analyze, let alone keep up with as new packages are published and existing ones changed. For reference, NPM (which is the largest repository of Javascript packages) contains over a million published packages, with nearly a thousand more published daily. It has grown from around 350,000 published packages to over 1.5 million packages in merely three years! Considering that NPM is simply one of dozens of such repositories, it is easy to see that manually analyzing even a fraction of the packages in existence is simply untenable.</p><p>The authors of <em>The Backstabber's Knife Collection</em> noted that across the board, discovered malicious packages were able to stay in distribution for great lengths of time - in many cases greater than a year before discovery. While each ecosystem makes some attempts at curation they do not seem to be terribly effective at preventing future attacks. The efforts are restricted to small silos of data, which fail to address some of the major issues the paper uncovered (such as cross-ecosystem package listing). Additionally, of all the products currently on the market that do any sort of package analysis, the only solutions provided essentially boil down to manual analysis. If Pitchbook's industry analysis puts the global count of all infosec professionals at 6 million, it is flatly impossible to hire enough staff to police an ecosystem of 60 million or greater packages that are constantly evolving, with tens of thousands more being published every day.</p><p>Clearly, this needs to change. Here at Phylum we are working to bring modern analysis and data mining to bear, providing a path to unite these ecosystems and help protect the open source community.</p>

<![CDATA[5 Steps that decreased our bounce rate by a huge 41%]]>

July 28, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/bounce2.png"></center>
<p>When my mother in law told me the solitaire game she loved was no longer online, my friend and I thought that it might be a fun project to launch our own site. We had previously built a consumer business that reached 30M students yearly, and thought solitaire could be a fun playground to learn about gaming and even tie in and test concepts like mental stress and cognition. </p>
<p>We launched our <a href="https://solitaired.com/">free solitaire game</a> on Solitaired.com. </p>
<p>As users came in, we saw that our bounce rate averaged around 37%. â€œNot bad,â€� we thought. Most content sites had much higher bounce rates, and our past businesses that were optimized had bounce rates in that range. When we studied other gaming sites though using Similar Web, we saw that they had lower bounce rates. What if we can achieve something similar or better?</p>
<h2 id="1investigatingbrowserissuesmovingfrom37to34">1. Investigating browser issues: moving from 37% to 34%</h2>
<p>From past experience, we know getting our site to work across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari is no easy feat. Each browser has its nuances, and even if our solitaire game works smoothly on one browser, it doesnâ€™t mean it will work smoothly on others. </p>
<p>Having quickly launched our solitaire site, MVP style, we hypothesized this may be a good place to look based on past experience. </p>
<p>Low and behold, we saw that Safari had a terrible 56% bounce rate. </p>
<p>When we loaded the game in the browser, we noticed that upon clicking the cards, they sometimes did not move as expected. It was a major bug!</p>
<p>We also saw that IE Explorer had an even worse bounce rate of 73%. </p>
<p>With IE Explorer being less than 1% of our traffic and being phased out for Edge, we decided not to invest our time there, and instead fix the Safari bug. </p>
<p>The result: bounce rate decreased by 8%, and dropped to an average of 34%!</p>
<h2 id="2optimizingmobileresponsivenessmovingfrom34to30">2. Optimizing mobile responsiveness: moving from 34% to 30%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/mobile.png"></p>
<p>We saw in our data that mobile users represented approximately 20% of our user base, so we knew that was a segment we needed to pay attention to. </p>
<p>When we looked at our mobile bounce rate in Google Analytics, it was well above our new average of 34%, hovering at 51%. That was clearly an issue. </p>
<p>We first saw in our vertical orientation on mobile that the cards were almost illegible. When we increased the size, mobile bounce rate improved meaningfully to 40%. </p>
<p>Still though, the cards were small because they were limited by the length of the phone in vertical orientation. </p>
<p>What if we optimized our horizontal orientation?</p>
<p>First, we made sure that when tilted horizontally, the cards would take up the entire screen, making the card interaction easier. Then, we created a graphic to encourage uses in vertical orientation to try horizontal orientation for a better experience. </p>
<p>The result: overall bounce rate dropped to 30%!</p>
<h2 id="3changingthecardbackmovingfrom30to28">3. Changing the card back: moving from 30% to 28%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/design2.png"></p>
<p>In our support center, a user asked if we could offer a better design for our card back. We reached out to this user, and asked why.</p>
<p>She said that our current design looked pixelated and didnâ€™t contract well with the green felt. Instead, a red card back that looked like a real card could be better, and indicate that our site was a high quality one. It was one of those insights where you kick yourself and say â€œduh.â€� </p>
<p>To be sure, we ran a user survey via hotjar showing a new card design. 71% of respondents said they preferred our current red card back on the site.</p>
<p>After making this change and our bounce rate decreased to an average of 28%</p>
<h2 id="4addingimportantfunctionalityandreducingbouncerateto26">4. Adding important functionality and reducing bounce rate to 26%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Features.png"></p>
<p>In classic solitaire, there are two popular forms of games played. One is where you turn 1 card at a time over from the stockpile, and another where you turn 3 cards over from the stockpile. </p>
<p>We default to turn 1, but only in our all games menu did we link to the turn 3 options. </p>
<p>We hypothesized that many of our users wanted a turn 3 option, and may have been bouncing when they didnâ€™t see that immediately available. We ran a quick user survey via HotJar and which confirmed this, giving us confidence itâ€™s worth adding this to the game. We added a tab that allows you to flip between modes.</p>
<p>Not only did we see turn 3 solitaire play increase materially, but we further reduced our bounce rate to 26%. 
Whatâ€™s interesting is our users did not naturally write in saying they couldnâ€™t find turn 3. Those users who were looking for it likely just naturally bounced. We had to research and hypothesize to unearth this.</p>
<h2 id="5leveragingdatatodropthebouncerateto22">5. Leveraging data to drop the bounce rate to 22%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/getstarted.png"></p>
<p>Once we added Google event tracking to all our buttons, we were able to get insights into what features were most engaged, and it was eye opening. </p>
<p>It turned out that the hint button was a popular feature. In retrospect, it made sense. Itâ€™s easy to get stuck in solitaire, and undoing is the only way to get you back on track. </p>
<p>We found that after the new game and undo feature, this was the next most popular one, with 20% of our audience clicking it. </p>
<p>However, the hint was on the far right of our navigation. Knowing that internet users look at websites in an F-shaped pattern, this meant that some users who might be new to solitaire might not even notice this feature. If they donâ€™t know how to play, the hint feature is critical to getting them started.</p>
<p>We moved the hint button right after the undo button, closer to the left of the screen. We not only did this increase clicks on it by 25%, we reduced our bounce rate to 22%. Users who had to brush up on how to play solitaire suddenly had an easy way to do that.</p>
<h2 id="youcanalwaysimproveuserexperience">You can always improve user experience.</h2>
<p>Focusing on bounce rate is a great place to start when improving your site. Improving your bounce rate is the rising tide that lifts all business KPIs.</p>
<p>Start collecting data and try user tracking tools like HotJar to understand where there are opportunities to improve. Youâ€™ll be surprised by how much you can improve.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Avo, we receive a number of requests to recommend best practices. In this first post in our best practices series I’d like to tell you about the Purpose Meeting, a great platform to find and prioritize the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking to understand the success for every feature release.</p><h2><strong>Meet the Purpose Meeting</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p><strong>purpose meeting</strong></p><p>/ˈpəːpəs ˈmiːtɪŋ/</p><p><em>noun</em></p><p>A platform to align stakeholders on the purpose of a product release, and map out the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking to understand its success.</p><p><strong>30 minute meeting where stakeholders go through these 3 steps:</strong><br></p><figure id="w-node-a468629a17b6-c4a10212"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e2fb0285251e18fb3221f3e/5ea2389d52f0aa1e99d8c457_Tracking%20the%20right%20product%20metrics%20-%20asset.png" alt="avo-tracking-the-right-metrics"></p><figcaption><em>If you're unsure what to track, try the 30 minute Purpose Meeting, that helps align stakeholders on shipping good metrics and highlights the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking. While building good analytics culture, we recommend doing this with all stakeholders for every feature release. </em><strong><em>Read on for tips on each step.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>We developed the Purpose Meeting at QuizUp, to make our data better. Before every feature release, we’d gather the stakeholders for 30 minutes – an engineer from each development platform (iOS, Android, web, backend), a PM, a designer, a data specialist – and we’d go through these steps ☝️</p><p>‍</p><p>The impact of doing this for every feature release went way beyond ensuring we had the highest-impact-lowest-effort tracking in place to understand the success of our releases. It turned out to be a fundamentally helpful process to ensure alignment on <em>why</em> we were shipping what we were shipping.&nbsp;</p><p>Purpose meetings revolutionized engineering buy-in for analytics at QuizUp. Engineers would request purpose meetings before they kicked off feature development because it made their work more efficient and purposeful. With analytics defined before writing any feature code, iOS and Android would always be in sync. It eradicated the need to refactor code to add analytics after-the-fact. <strong>Analytics went from being a “chore” that was done “for the data team” and “not for the end user”, to something that devs were interested in to understand how successful their release was</strong>. The developer conversion from looking up release metrics in Amplitude sky rocketed – from a couple of developers, to the majority of developers being curious.</p><h2><strong>Your data is a product. It has stakeholders.</strong></h2><p>Your data is a product. It should be considered from usability, market, business viability and engineering feasibility, just like other products. The stakeholders for these four pillars are:</p><p><strong>Data consumers:</strong> Typically Product Managers and Data Scientists, who consume data to build insights and make decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Data producers:</strong> Typically Product Developers who add tracking calls to the product code base to produce data for the consumers.</p><p>To get the most out of your data, you should align these stakeholders, and agree on what data is important and attainable. If you don’t, you won’t be able to prioritize your tracking based on impact and effort.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Purpose Meeting: Deciding the highest impact lowest effort tracking</strong></h2><p>‍</p><h3><strong>1. Align on goals</strong></h3><p>The first step is knowing the reason for your release. Define your goals by asking yourselves questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>What are we trying to help our users accomplish?</li><li>What is the problem that we are trying to solve?</li><li>Who are we solving it for?</li><li>What does success look like?</li></ul><p>Iterate and discuss your goal until you have clarity and alignment for all stakeholders.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> aligns us on the problem we want to solve <em>for our users</em> and what value that brings them. A <strong>bad goal</strong> is framed only from our own business perspective.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> supports our other goals. A <strong>bad goal</strong> creates ambiguity around what’s most important.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> encompasses that problem we want to solve. A <strong>bad goal</strong> leads us to a local maxima by focusing only on a part of the problem.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> is specific enough that it helps us make better decisions for the release. A <strong>bad goal</strong> leads us to want to expand our work out of scope by being too broad.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> is one that all stakeholders can align behind. If you get the right group of people together, the room (or... ehh... Zoom…) will develop great ideas together. A <strong>bad goal</strong> decreases clarity, muddies up the release missions and obscures the goal of the release.</p><h3><strong>2. Commit to metrics</strong></h3><p>Next up is to commit to how you will measure the success of your goal. You can do this by asking questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>How will we know if this goal is successful?</li><li>What steps will the user need to go through to achieve the goal?&nbsp;</li><li>Are there likely user journey drop-offs or dead-ends that we’d want to detect?</li></ul><p>It can be very helpful to think through what our success report and narrative will look like, because it clarifies requirements for the type of data we will need, which helps us design the relevant data in step 3:</p><ul role="list"><li>How will we measure the impact of the release? Compare cohorts of users? A/B test the release? Change over time?</li><li>What is a relevant metric to measure the success of our users?</li><li>Is it the conversion through a set of steps? E.g. open the app and choose a song to play.</li><li>Is it the total count of something? E.g. count of users who play a song per day, or just total number songs played per day?</li><li>Is it a rate? E.g. day one retention, or checkout conversion.</li><li>How do we visualize these? Time series? Bar chart with conversion funnel?</li><li>How do we visualize the comparison? Bar per group? Line per group?</li></ul><p>Iterate on your metric until stakeholders agree that it would help determine the positive or negative impact of the release:</p><p>A <strong>good metric</strong> has clear definitions. A <strong>bad metric</strong> is vague. For example “create a playlist and add at least 5 songs to it”, vs “use playlists”. Or for example, what defines “active” users? Is it enough to open the app or do they need to play a song? Are we talking about daily, weekly or monthly “active”?</p><p>A <strong>good metric</strong> has a way to be understood and visualized. A <strong>bad metric</strong> has multiple ways of interpretation.</p><p>A <strong>good metric</strong> will keep us aligned on whether the release was a success or not. A <strong>bad metric</strong> will leave ambiguity over the success. For example “median # songs per playlist” would be <em>bad</em> to measure the success of increasing conversion to adding songs to playlists. Why? Because it’s likely that the number of users who add songs to playlists will go up, which will negatively impact the metric we chose.</p><p>This exercise will surface a set of metrics. It’s a good exercise, and will help clarify your success criteria. However, it’s important to prioritize them. <strong>You should choose the simplest metric that you’re willing to rely on to determine whether your release was a success or a failure. </strong>It will a) align everyone on the most important needle to move, and b) ensure you prioritize and ship the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking when the time comes to cut the analytics scope due to lack of time until release.</p><h3><strong>3. Design data</strong></h3><p>Finally, it’s time to design the data. Here we use the metrics we committed to as guiding light. Our remaining job is to fill the blanks with the analytics events and properties we’ll need. It’s fun. Like a puzzle. You’ll want to ask questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>Which user journey steps do we need to log to visualize this rate?</li><li>What properties will we need to segment or filter our data by?</li></ul><p><strong>Good data</strong> will be useful as-is. <strong>Bad data</strong> will require the data consumer to ask for engineering time and post-processing. For example, if you’re sending data into Amplitude, don’t assume it’s enough to have the “song id”, because an ID means very little to the data consumer in Amplitude. It will require a data expert to export the data to perform SQL gymnastics on it to enrich it with the song name or artist name.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-3e42f2d53b29461b2add"><div><p>Magnetism is a common phenomenon for all, yet poorly understood by most. We become acquainted with magnetism from a very early age, maybe noticing that they’re used to pin photos and documents to the refrigerator by our parents or maybe we experience them as toys. Maybe we were lucky enough to experience magnetic sand at a science museum. If we were born in Japan, Germany, or Russia, we may have had first-hand experience with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#New_York,_United_States,_1968"><span>magnetically levitated trains</span></a>. In any event, we were each almost certainly astounded by our first encounter with magnets; a seemingly magical action-at-a-distance between two otherwise ordinary looking objects. If you can’t remember the feeling, watch&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/qI8AM8UM7kI?t=29"><span>this kid</span></a>.</p><div><p>But action-at-a-distance is not a matter of magic, it is a matter of physics. Our sense of wonder for magnets may turn to an inquiry into the science behind the familiar phenomenon. Perhaps that is what led you to this page. Unfortunately, as of this publication, the overwhelming majority of explanations for magnetic action terminate in one of two dead-ends. First, you will learn that atoms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM"><span>are each tiny magnets</span></a>&nbsp;and so composite materials simply behave depending on the coordination of their subunits. This obviously punts the question of what makes the tiny magnets attract? For that line of inquiry, we are generally met with the second fatal roadblock:&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms interact magnetically due to magnetic fields. Of course, this explanation, however deep one dives into the mathematical descriptions of fields, begs the question: what&nbsp;<em>is</em>a magnetic field?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"><span>The magnetic field</span></a>&nbsp;of physics is a dynamic description — that is, it has both a shape and motion. This is evident from the basic unit of magnetic field strength, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"><span>ampere</span></a>/m. The ampere signifies charge per time and is the basic unit of current. Hence, a magnetic field is dynamic: it what some<em>thing</em>&nbsp;is doing. Therefore, in alternative to traditional visualizations, our explanation of magnetism begins not with an activity like a field but with an actor: the atom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Magnetism is presently understood as one side of a double-headed atomic phenomenon called electromagnetism. Electricity being the simpler of the two faces, it is all but imperative that you go back and&nbsp;<a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/how-to-visualize-electricity"><span>read our work-up</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OakgcRuBBbg"><span>watch the animation</span></a>&nbsp;for visualizing electricity before proceeding here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are short on time, I’ll provide you with an extremely brief re-cap. We integrate contemporary mathematical descriptions of electricity into an explanation that we believe improves upon traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XWeQuEhU4"><span>hydraulic</span></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rb9guSEeVE"><span>and electron-bead-flow</span></a>&nbsp;models.&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, we illustrate the concept of charge through the rotation of atomic surfaces. These surfaces, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orbitals.com/orb/index.html"><span>electron shells (e-shell) or orbitals</span></a>, behave per quantum mechanical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function"><span>electron wave functions</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface-to-surface transmission of e-shell rotation between aligned shells of atoms constitutes electricity. Although there are never electron beads moving along in our wire, our visualization of electricity is entirely consistent with modern mathematical representations. Current flow is merely reimagined as propagation of&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;e-shell surface rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><p>We utilize the simplest and most abundant atom, hydrogen, for our explanation of both electricity and magnetism, since it has only a single electron forming one e-shell orbital. We fashion a simple, hypothetical single-atom-thick wire from ionized hydrogen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ionization indicates that the atoms electron surface is not localized by enmeshed with its neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can extend the electromagnetic principles applied to hydrogen across other more complex elements and molecules by the careful addition of orbital surfaces, recognizing that new e-shells may participate in conduction and bonding alone while others may rotate freely and separately contribute to magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic action is next explained as a natural extension of the aligned rotation of conducting electron surfaces in a current-carrying wire. Through the vertical transmission of rotational momentum between atoms through polar surface contact, a horizontal interaction is also introduced toward their equators. The magnetic field, B, of the atom describes this surface motion, which occurs 90 degrees orthogonal to current, I (see&nbsp;<strong>Fig 1A</strong>).</p><p>The reason that magnetic action extends beyond the current-carrying wire’s apparent surface is that while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Chemistry/armstrong/chem_101a/h_orbitals.pdf"><span>99.999% of the electron exists within 430 pm of the nucleus</span></a>, there is a small chance of finding that surface extended to incredible distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, under Quantum Mechanics,&nbsp;<a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_the_Electronic_Structure_of_Atoms_and_Molecules_(Bader)/3%3A_The_Hydrogen_Atom/3.3%3A_The_Probability_Distribution_of_the_Hydrogen_Atom"><span>the radial distribution function</span></a>&nbsp;for the electron has no limit on reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our model, we represent this unusual quality of the atom as rarefied extensions of the electron shell:&nbsp;&nbsp;incredibly thin filaments, radially organized about the atom (<strong>Fig 1B)</strong>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595356514575_50369"><p>We imagine the physical extensions of the atomic surface are responsible for the action-at-a-distance. Lateral magnetic motion of conductive rotating e-shells thus synergizes between current-aligned wires, pulling them together as shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong>&nbsp;below (panels&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>). This illustrates the basic principle of magnetic attraction. By inverting one of the wires, we find that currents are now opposed, as are the magnetic actions of each column’s atoms (<strong>Fig 2C</strong>). The clash of opposing effort between e-shells in each column drives the wires apart and illustrates magnetic repulsion.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_18181"><div><p>To construct the most basic magnet imaginable, we coil up our single-file hydrogen wire as shown in below in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Coiling of the wire aligns the lateral motion of all e-shells on the surface of the composite cylinder (<strong>Fig 3B</strong>). The combined flow of the coil’s composite surface appears to track out from one end of the coil and into the other. The composite magnetic field describes this pole-to-pole flow of the coil’s atomic surfaces.</p><p>It is now easy to understand how the magnetic attraction between current-aligned wires multiplies through the coil’s architecture, since lateral efforts align and combine.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we bring the North pole of one coil near the South pole of another, the radial extensions of the e-shell enmesh laterally and pull the coils together magnetically (<strong>Fig 3C</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverting one coil and pitting South vs. South or North vs. North poles has the opposite effect, where the conflicting effort of each coil’s atoms push them apart (<strong>Fig 3D</strong>).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_54398"><div><p>Again, any visualization of intricate physical processes inherently necessitates simplification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have utilized a single-atom-thick wire of ionized hydrogen for our demonstration and readily acknowledge this as a hypothetical object only. If such a wire exists naturally, its likeness is probably only found in the deep reaches of outer space. In our every-day reality, we only encounter synthetic electromagnets comprised of more complex atoms. This means those metals have additional surfaces. In common conducting materials, such as copper, there may be several polar contacts available for electromagnetic interaction.</p><p>Even more complex metals, like those found in a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"><span>bar magnet</span></a>, appear to utilize separate orbitals for bonding and conduction than those involved in magnetism. We would visualize distinct magnetized e-shells as freely rotating, and spatially isolated from the conductive bonding lattice. This is why “permanently” magnetized materials do not exhibit a current. Furthermore, the relevant magnetic e-shell surfaces in bar magnets still retain the essential pattern of the spiraled coil from our depiction. We are working toward an animation of these complex atoms and will present an appropriate visualization in a future post/video.</p><p>One final note is that often the strongest magnet is a combination of a magnetizable metal with a coil. A magnetizable metal has unencumbered e-shells distinct from bonding and these surfaces are readily incited to magnetic cohesion through contact with coil’s extended atomic surfaces. Often, cores of electromagnets utilize iron or nickel for the very reason that these elements are highly&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"><span>susceptible</span></a>&nbsp;to the magnetic behaviors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"><span>moment</span></a>) of proximally excited atoms in the coil.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contributing aligned e-shells to lateral rotatory action, the iron/nickel atoms amplify the strength of the coil’s electromagnetism.</p></div></div></div>]]>

That access includes the ability to lock and unlock the account, to view direct messages, and to change email addresses.</p><blockquote><p id="038a">As we’ve seen with Twitter, access without accountability is problematic, but even with accountability, insider threats are still a problem. <strong>Software companies need to start rethinking employee access completely.</strong></p></blockquote><figure><div></div><figcaption>SaaS businesses say your data is safe but is it really when much of the company has access? Nearly 1 in 4 Twitter employees can access customer accounts.</figcaption></figure><p id="18f6">It isn’t just Twitter that does this. It’s extremely common for employees of SaaS companies to have access to sensitive customer data. I’m not just talking about their contact info here, I’m talking about the data that they store with the SaaS vendor.</p><p id="848d">In places where I’ve worked that sold enterprise cloud software, most of customer support, ops, devops, engineering, and professional services had the ability to access customer data or to act in the context of a particular customer.</p><p id="c58b">I don’t think this access was generally abused. It was used to help customers solve problems, to understand issues, to debug software, and to provide services. And we had systems to gate the access that logged whenever an employee looked at customer data and what they looked at.</p><p id="82ba">But the question is: who was looking at those logs? I don’t think they were regularly monitored in places where I worked. And those logs certainly weren’t published to the customer.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Access logs are only useful if they’re being monitored. In many cases, they aren’t and customers don’t know who’s been in their account.</figcaption></figure><p id="d154">When people think they can do something and no one will notice, accountability is lost, even if there’s a record somewhere.</p><p id="c110">Twitter’s embarrassing moment where high-profile accounts were taken over is only an extreme and highly obvious sign of abuse. But even before that happened, Twitter employees were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/twitter-s-security-woes-included-broad-access-to-user-accounts?sref=dZ65CIng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spying on the private messages of notable Twitter users</a>.</p><p id="d71f">And Twitter knows it’s a problem.</p><blockquote><p id="7fee">“In September of 2018, shortly before he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, I met privately with Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey. During that conversation, Mr. Dorsey told me the company was working on end-to-end encrypted direct messages. It has been nearly two years since our meeting, and Twitter DMs are still not encrypted, leaving them vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.” — Senator Ron Wyden</p></blockquote><p id="9a32">Twitter is a recipe for disaster for two reasons:</p><ol><li id="dc69">Privileged users can access private data.</li><li id="a062">There’s no way for users to know when that has happened.</li></ol><p id="9f72"><strong>Without transparency, there’s no accountability. Without accountability, there can be no trust.</strong></p><p id="6819">Twitter is a high profile example, but I believe strongly that these problems have equally high stakes in the business world. Businesses trust their data to Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and thousands of other cloud providers. The more sophisticated of these, like those I’ve mentioned, take extra measures to protect against curious or malicious insiders.</p><p id="21d7">For example, Google recently released GCP Access Transparency so companies can know when a GCP administrator has accessed their data (unless something like a FISA court order compels them to secrecy, in which case they hold back those logs). This feature also lets the customer approve access by support engineers before it happens.</p><p id="345f"><strong><em>Unfortunately, Google only offers this feature to its enterprise customers with premium support levels. And even then it isn’t on by default</em></strong><em>. </em><strong><em>You have to ask support to turn it on</em></strong><em>.</em></p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Enterprise customers who want GCP Access Transparency have to ask for it.</figcaption></figure><p id="e2b0">Sunshine is the best antidote. When customers can see how their data is accessed, they can react to that information. And when cloud vendor employees know that a customer will see them accessing their data, they act more responsibly and more cautiously.</p><p id="c7c9"><strong>It comes down to </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ironcorelabs.com/saas-trust-models-for-security-and-data-privacy-a83731c2a446"><strong>SaaS Trust Models</strong></a><strong>. Buyers need to know and understand these models to make informed decisions.</strong></p><p id="e019">The full-trust model can no longer be the default when potentially sensitive information is at play. End-to-end encryption and zero-trust models are ideal, but there’s a sliding scale of options including the trust-but-verify model that is fast becoming a standard request from enterprises.</p><p id="023d">It’s time to move incrementally, if not in jumps, to stronger trust models. Full trust without verification is a toxic stew.</p><p id="733f">With great power comes great temptation. Twitter has put this on display, but if you look closely, the same dynamic is everywhere around us. But we can fix it.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Several teams that&nbsp;ranked behind the Iroquois Nationals have been invited to compete in Alabama.</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee —&nbsp;a confederacy of six First Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations — invented lacrosse and call it the&nbsp;Creator's Game.</p>  <p>The Iroquois Nationals are member in good standing of World Lacrosse. But it's the International World Games Association (IWGA) that determines eligibility for the Alabama tournament.</p>  <p>The IWGA has not responded to requests for comment. The organizing committee for the World Games in Birmingham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/petition-calls-for-boycott-of-world-lacrosse-games-after-iroquois-nationals-excluded/">told APTN</a>&nbsp;that IWGA follows the&nbsp;criteria established by the International Olympics Committee, which states that "the expression country means an independent State recognized by the international community."</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy more than meets that definition, says Iroquois Nationals executive director Leo Nolan, a Mohawk from the Onondaga Nation. Here is part of his conversation with&nbsp;<em>As It Happens </em>guest host Susan Bonner.</p>  <p><strong>Take us through the moment you found out the Nationals were not invited to the World Games. What was your reaction?</strong></p>  <p>We found out through a third party in late September, early October.</p>  <p>We immediately sent a letter to World Lacrosse asking about our lack of inclusion. And the response back was that we didn't meet what they believed were — and this is their belief — that we wouldn't meet that criteria as a nation state to be included in the Olympics.</p>  <p>All of this is a precursor of the Olympics, which, you know, we're right now on provisional status, lacrosse as a sport. And once the provisional status is lifted, then hopefully lacrosse will be reintroduced to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The Iroquois Nationals travel with Haudenosaunee passports — a fact that has led to travel delays in previous competitions. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Candace Maracle)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does the team rank worldwide?</strong></p>  <p>In the men's ... we are third in the world.

So I think it's more a lack of ...&nbsp;understanding our status.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We are the originators of the game.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3>Finally, a side-by-side code comparison between React and Vue! 🎉</h3>
<p>Back in 2017/2018, I'd been using Vue at work quite a lot. I felt comfortable with it and had a
fairly solid understanding of how it worked. I had, however, been curious to know what the grass was
like on the other side of the fence — the grass in this scenario being React.</p>
<p>I’d read the React docs and watched a few tutorial videos and, while they were great and all, what I
really wanted to know was how different React was from Vue. By “different”, I didn’t mean things
such as whether they both had virtual DOMS or how they went about rendering pages. I wanted someone
to take the time to explain the code! I wanted to find an article that took the time to explain this
so that someone new to either Vue or React (or Web Development as a whole) could gain a better
understanding of the differences between the two.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anything that tackled this. So I came to the realisation that I would
have to go ahead and build this myself in order to see the similarities and differences. In doing
so, I thought I’d document the whole process so that an article on this will finally exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-vs-vue.png" alt="Who wore it better?"></p>
<p>I decided to try and build a fairly standard To Do App that allows a user to add and delete items
from the list. Both apps were built using the default CLIs (create-react-app for React, and vue-cli
for Vue). CLI stands for Command Line Interface by the way. 🤓</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences-e9a1ae8077fd">article I originally wrote</a>
ended up going viral. At its height, it was receiving ~1000 views per minute, which I still find
insanely humbling for a tech article. I was really happy to see that many people had found
themselves in a similar situation to me and had been waiting for such an article to be written.</p>
<p>When React Hooks were released, I followed up the original article with a
'<a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences-2019-edition-42ba2cab9e56">2019 Edition</a>'
which replaced the use of Class Components with Functional Hooks. <strong>With the release of Vue version
3 and its Composition API, now is the time to one again update this article with a '2020 Edition'.</strong></p>
<h3>Anyway, this intro is already longer than I’d anticipated. So let’s start by having a quick look at how the two apps look:</h3>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/todo-side-by-side.png" alt="React vs Vue. The Immovable Object meets the Irresistible Force!"></p>
<p>The CSS code for both apps are exactly the same, but there are differences in where these are
located. With that in mind, let’s next have a look at the file structure of both apps:</p>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/folder-structure-side-by-side.png"></p>
<p>You’ll see that their structures are similar as well. The key difference so far is that the React
app has two CSS files, whereas the Vue app doesn’t have any. The reason for this is because
create-react-app creates its default React components with a separate file for its styles, whereas
Vue CLI creates single files that contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its default Vue components.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they both achieve the same thing, and there is nothing to say that you can’t go ahead
and structure your files differently in React or Vue. It really comes down to personal preference.
You will hear plenty of discussion from the dev community over how CSS should be structured,
especially with regard to React, as there are a number of CSS-in-JS solutions such as
styled-components, and emotion. CSS-in-JS is literally what it sounds like by the way. While these
are useful, for now, we will just follow the structure laid out in both CLIs.</p>
<p>But before we go any further, let’s take a quick look at what a typical Vue and React component look
like:</p>
<p><strong>A typical React file:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-todoitem.png" title="A typical React file"></p>
<p><strong>A typical Vue file:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/vue-todoitem.png" title="A typical Vue file"></p>
<p>Now that’s out of the way, let’s get into the nitty gritty detail!</p>
<h3>How do we mutate data?</h3>
<p>But first, what do we even mean by “mutate data”? Sounds a bit technical doesn’t it? It basically
just means changing the data that we have stored. So if we wanted to change the value of a person’s
name from John to Mark, we would be ‘mutating the data’. So this is where a key difference between
React and Vue lies. While Vue essentially creates a data object, where data can freely be updated,
React handles this through what is known as a state hook.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the set up for both in the images below, then we will explain what is going on
after:</p>
<p><strong>React state:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-state.png" title="React state"></p>
<p><strong>Vue state:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/vue-state.png" title="Vue state"></p>
<p>So you can see that we have passed the same data into both, but the structure is a bit different.</p>
<p>With React — or at least since 2019 — we would typically handle state through a series of Hooks.
These might look a bit strange at first if you haven’t seen this type of concept before. Basically,
it works as follows:</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to create a list of todos. We would likely need to create a variable called list
and it would likely take an array of either strings or maybe objects (if say we want to give each
todo string an ID and maybe some other things. We would set this up by writing
<code>const [list, setList] = useState([])</code>. Here we are using what React calls a Hook — called
<code>useState</code>. This basically lets us keep local state within our components.</p>
<p>Also, you may have noticed that we passed in an empty array <code>[]</code> inside of <code>useState()</code>. What we put
inside there is what we want list to initially be set to, which in our case, we want to be an empty
array. However, you will see from the image above that we passed in some data inside of the array,
which ends up being the initialised data for list. Wondering what setList does? There will be more
on this later!</p>
<p>In Vue, you would typically place all of your mutable data for a component inside of a <code>setup()</code>
function that returns an object with the data and functions you want to expose (which basically just
means the things you want to be able to make available for use in your app). You will notice that
each piece of state (aka the data we want to be able to mutate) data in our app is wrapped inside of
a <code>ref()</code> function. This <code>ref()</code> function is something that we import from Vue and makes it possible
for our app to update whenever any of those pieces of data are changed/updated. In short, if you
want to make mutable data in Vue, assign a variable to the <code>ref()</code> function and place any default
data inside of it.</p>
<h3>So how would we reference mutable data in our app?</h3>
<p>Well, let’s say that we have some piece of data called name that has been assigned a value of
<code>Sunil</code>.</p>
<p>In React, as we have our smaller pieces of state that we created with <code>useState()</code>, it is likely
that we would have created something along the lines of <code>const [name, setName] = useState('Sunil')</code>.
In our app, we would reference the same piece of data by calling simply calling name. Now the key
difference here is that we cannot simply write <code>name = 'John'</code>, because React has restrictions in
place to prevent this kind of easy, care-free mutation-making. So in React, we would write
<code>setName('John')</code>. This is where the setName bit comes into play. Basically, in
<code>const [name, setName] = useState('Sunil')</code>, it creates two variables, one which becomes
<code>const name = 'Sunil'</code>, while the second <code>const setName</code> is assigned a function that enables name to
be recreated with a new value.</p>
<p>In Vue, this would be sitting inside of the <code>setup()</code> function and would have been called
<code>const name = ref(‘Sunil')</code>. In our app, we would reference this by calling <code>name.value</code>. With Vue,
if we want to use the value created inside of a <code>ref()</code> function, we look for <code>.value</code> on the
variable rather than simply calling the variable. In other words, if we want the value of a variable
that holds state, we look for <code>name.value</code>, <em>not</em> <code>name</code>. If you want to update the value of <code>name</code>,
you would do so by updating <code>name.value</code>. For example, let's say that I want to change my name from
Sunil to John. I'd do this by writing <code>name.value = "John"</code>. I’m not sure how I feel about being
called John, but hey ho, things happen! 😅</p>
<p>Effectively React and Vue are doing the same thing here, which is creating data that can be updated.
Vue essentially combines its own version of name and setName by default whenever a piece of data
wrappeed inside of a <code>ref()</code> function gets updated. React requires that you call setName() with the
value inside in order to update state, Vue makes an assumption that you’d want to do this if you
were ever trying to update values inside the data object. So Why does React even bother with
separating the value from the function, and why is <code>useState()</code> even needed? Essentially, React
wants to be able to re-run certain life cycle hooks whenever state changes. In our example, if
<code>setName()</code> is called, React will know that some state has changed and can, therefore, run those
lifecycle hooks. If you directly mutated state, React would have to do more work to keep track of
changes and what lifecycle hooks to run etc.</p>
<p>Now that we have mutations out of the way, let’s get into the nitty, gritty by looking at how we
would go about adding new items to both of our To Do Apps.</p>
<h3>How do we create new To Do Items?</h3>
<h4>React:</h4>
<pre><code>const createNewToDoItem = () =&gt; {
    const newId = generateId();
    const newToDo = { id: newId, text: toDo };
    setList([...list, newToDo]);
    setToDo("");
};
</code></pre>
<h4>How did React do that?</h4>
<p>In React, our input field has an attribute on it called <strong>value. </strong>This value gets automatically
updated every time its value changes through what is known as an <strong>onChange event listener</strong>. The
JSX (which is basically a variant of HTML), looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input
    type="text"
    placeholder="I need to..."
    value={toDo}
    onChange={handleInput}
    onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So every time the value is changed, it updates state. The handleInput function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>const handleInput = (e) =&gt; {
    setToDo(e.target.value);
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now, whenever a user presses the <strong>+ </strong>button on the page to add a new item, the <strong>createNewToDoItem
</strong>function is triggered. Let’s take a look at that function again to break down what is going on:</p>
<pre><code>const createNewToDoItem = () =&gt; {
    const newId = generateId();
    const newToDo = { id: newId, text: toDo };
    setList([...list, newToDo]);
    setToDo("");
};
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially the <code>newId</code> function is basically creating a new ID that we will give to our new <code>toDo</code>
item. The <code>newToDo</code> variable is an object that takes that has an id key that is …</p></article></div>

<p>$667 billion dollars were set aside in 2020 for businesses across the US. This program was called the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paycheck Protection Program</a> (PPP for short). It was meant to be a stimulus package to hold over businesses who were impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns. Without revenue streams, many businesses had to lay-off workers en masse, providing a potentially catastrophic destabilization of American society. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were close to 18 million unemployed people in June of 2018. The PPP data indicates that over 31 million jobs were retained due to the program.</p>



<p>Without getting into the inaccuracies of the standard unemployment numbers provided by the Bureau, we can still see that laying off potentially 10% of a country’s population wouldn’t be healthy for society. In the past, the US government has provided stimulus and bailouts primarily via public spending increases and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying toxic assets from big corporations</a>. But this stimulus was meant to directly support businesses of all sizes who were directly impacted by the lockdown. Did it server its purpose? You can be the judge of that! I’ve created a data visualization meant to help show where the money went across the nation. This visualization includes the ability to search and filter on columns of the data. In the near future, I’ll be releasing a dashboard that digs into the… more suspicious loans taken out.</p>
</div>




</div>



<p>Here’s the dashboard, it’s interactive and has some additional info when you hover over data. It is configured for desktop and phones, but is better to view on desktop.:</p>



                



<p>This data was recently released regarding PPP loans. It was split into different data sets. For loans greater than $150k, data for the whole nation is provided in one data set. For loans less than $150k, data is split by state or territory into its own data set. I’ll be providing a combined data set of all loans here in a little bit, but for now this visualization is for loans greater than $150k.</p>



<p>Some interesting takeaways from this visualization:</p>



<ul><li>Allegedly nearly 10% of the US population’s jobs were retained due to the program</li><li>There were TONS of misspellings and bad data entry</li><li>The majority of loans were in the $150k-$300k range</li></ul>

<p>As a nonprofit coding organization running physical events, a lot of what CodeDay does (in a normal year) requires sending things in the real-world. Broadly speaking, this includes event supplies to event teams, and swag/awards to community members and volunteers.</p>



<p>In our early days, I was shipping merch from my office, and every quarter I’d get together with a couple volunteers to assemble and ship out all the event supply boxes for the upcoming events. Eventually, this started to take up too much time.</p>



<p>This isn’t unique to organizations in STEM education, I had the same problem when I ran a startup. People love to represent the startups they use, so sending swag is a great way to market! I have fond memories from my last startup of walking around SoMa in the mornings, trying to find mail dropoffs that weren’t too full so I could stuff a some shirts in for our customers.</p>



<p>Today I’ll share our journey to a fully-automated swag distribution infrastructure. I believe this is something any startup could quickly replicate, so I hope this can save you time!</p>



<h2>First Attempt: Less Steps to Get Things Out the Door</h2>



<p>The first thing we tried was cutting out steps to get things out the door. There were two types of work I was doing: packaging, and labeling.</p>



<h3>Packaging</h3>



<p>90% of people who need swag are getting a single SKU: a t-shirt, a set of stickers, a thank-you letter, etc. So I + some volunteers started by just folding all the shirts and then packaging everything into individual envelopes.</p>



<p>Most of the time was spent on folding the shirts. We’ve recently switched to a printer that will just do this for us, <a href="https://www.gorillaprintshop.com/home">Gorilla Screen Printing in Seattle.</a> Super nice folks, and they will happily deliver individually bagged shirts with size stickers on request.</p>



<p>We kept a database of the final shipping weights of each type of packaged product.</p>



<h3>Labeling</h3>



<p>At this time, all our backend infrastructure was in PHP, so we started out by writing a PHP library to build shipping labels for UPS and USPS. Nowadays <a href="https://www.easypost.com/">Easypost </a>can do this for you, but as you’ll see soon, I don’t think this is the best route anymore.</p>



<p>The system worked like this: someone shared they were going to CodeDay on social media and then filled out a form with their address, the system generated a shipping label, and it was automatically printed with the Dymo LabelWriter API. Every morning I’d grab the printed labels, stick them on the corresponding items, and then take it to the mailbox.</p>



<p>(On the supplies side, our event management monolith, Clear, would automatically generate labels for event supplies once a quarter.)</p>



<p>A few months after we started using this library, I came across <a href="https://www.shipstation.com/">ShipStation, </a>which provides an easy API for entering shipments, and can batch-print shipment labels from a web UI. It was technically less automated than before, but it was nice to have a way to verify what was being shipped and manually add shipments, so we switched everything over.</p>



<p>This worked fine for a year or so, but eventually the volume increased a lot, and they closed the post office next to our office, so we started looking for a better solution.</p>



<h2>Second Attempt: Fully Automated Fulfillment</h2>



<p>To fully automate things, we started looking at 3rd-party logistics providers. These are companies that operate warehouses and employ workers to receive your items, stock them on a shelf, and then pick and ship them when you call an API.</p>



<p>We did some research into a few, which I included at the end, but most providers were focused on e-commerce or larger volumes. We ended out selecting <a href="https://www.shipbob.com/">ShipBob </a>because they had the most sensible pricing for this application.</p>



<p>Speaking of pricing, here’s how it works with ShipBob:</p>



<ul><li>You pay a <strong>receiving fee</strong> for each shipment you send to one of their warehouses. This is on the order of $25 and is insignificant if you’re restocking once or twice a year.</li><li>You pay a <strong>storage fee</strong> for each uniquely addressable item. This ranges from $5/mo – $40/mo depending on how much physical space they allocate to it. If you have 1 shirt in 2 colors and 5 sizes each, that’s 1*2*5=10 unique items. So consolidate your merch variations.</li><li>You pay a <strong>pick/pack</strong> fee for each item someone has to pack in a box… in theory. First several are free, and most orders are 1 or 2 items.</li><li>You pay <strong>shipping fees</strong> which are generally going to be less than what you’re paying now, unless you have a negotiated rate.</li></ul>



<p>All in all, our storage cost was about 1.5-2x what we were paying for a storage locker in Seattle, which feels reasonable to me. We were shipping enough that we had negotiated rates with UPS, so the shipping costs didn’t really change, but for most people that may offset some of the increase in storage.</p>



<p>And obviously this is probably saving a lot of money if you value your time highly.</p>



<h2>What About Print-on-Demand?</h2>



<p>If you’re going to ship a lot of swag, the pricing won’t work out, and the quality is also not amazing. (Not ideal for something you’re counting on people to wear for marketing.)</p>



<p>We’ve been trying Scalable Press for some of our really one-off items like a “CodeDay professional gamer” beanie we give out for our community gaming tournaments. The interface is really bad, but it can work for these use-cases.</p>



<h2>Where We Are Now</h2>



<p>CodeDay’s shipping infrastructure is now fully automated! For example, when a volunteer needs a new staff t-shirt, or some stickers for promotion, they just fill out a form, and a week later, it arrives in the mail. If we need to add something manually, we put it in ShipStation and it gets synced to ShipBob.</p>



<p>Every year, we order a year’s worth of supplies from our vendors and ship them to the warehouse. (Gorilla Screen Printing for shirts and hoodies, Zebra Prints for awards, Consolidated Label for holographic award stickers, Sticker Giant for other stickers, and GS-JJ for pins.)</p>



<p>We can go back to thinking about education! Everything is now magic!</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Partner Options</h2>



<h3>Amazon FBA</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Best prices on picking and shipping fees.</li><li>Presumably low rate of picking errors (since I’ve never gotten the wrong Amazon product).</li><li>Wide geographic distribution.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Complicated fee structure which is structured for e-commerce.</li><li>The “long-term storage fee.” Amazon wants high inventory turn-over, and fees increase substantially for items which are stored for more than a year.</li></ul>



<h3>Flexe</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible.</li><li>Wide network of partner warehouse.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible. Shipping isn’t our core competency so we want an opinionated solution.</li><li>Focused on higher volume sellers.</li></ul>



<h3>ShipBob (Our Pick)</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Own a decent number of warehouses in key markets.</li><li>Not too flexible, there is a “right way” to do it.</li><li>Documentation and pricing is less tied to e-commerce than other providers.</li><li>Reasonable fee structure (pay for shelf/pallet space, picking, and shipping) which is theoretically predictable.</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Higher picking error rate for visually similar items like shirts, even when items are barcoded.</li><li>Don’t consistently handle sets. A few times they have opened our sticker sets (a stapled bag labeled “THIS IS A SET DO NOT SEPARATE”) and sent people individual stickers.</li><li>Pricing is unpredictable in practice. Several times they have shipped a shirt in a 3′ cube box for $90, or stored a few small items on a pallet.</li></ul>

I work on Jepsen, which is a project to test distributed systems.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:29">0:02:29</a></span></p><p>And do you remember how you first got involved in the area of data management</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:32">0:02:32</a></span></p><p>out of college? I couldn't get into grad school actually happened during the financial crash in 2009. And I was working up a startup in San Francisco and doing distributed database work</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:42">0:02:42</a></span></p><p>there one thing led to another and so can you dig a bit more into what the Jepsen project is and some of the backstory of how you came to create it and your original inspiration or motivation for digging into this particular area?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:56">0:02:56</a></span></p><p>Yeah, so Jepson is a project to helped make distributed systems safer by testing them and seeing what they do under real world failure modes. And back around 2010, its distributed systems were becoming popular industry. But a lot of folks had sort of optimistic expectations. But what was possible, and there were some claims flying around that seemed a little bit irresponsible. There was a good deal of argument over this back and forth on Twitter and blogs, mailing lists. I was active on the React mailing list for quite some time. And eventually, I started Jepson to demonstrate that these problems were actually things that could happen in the real world. They were just theoretical issues.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:03:39">0:03:39</a></span></p><p>Yeah, I know that particularly when you are just testing and building a system. It's easy to see Oh, everything works great. And kind of push off the fact that there are going to be network faults and there are going to be clock skews and clock drifts that causes things to not operate the way that you want them to. And I'm curious what you have seen As far as some of the common misconceptions or misunderstandings of people who are both building and using distributed systems and the types of guarantees that they provide,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:10">0:04:10</a></span></p><p>yeah, that couldn't be started. There were all sorts of interesting expectations. I remember MongoDB, for example, wrote something about how users shouldn't expect to preserve data when a process crashes or is killed with kill dash nine. And as a result, I think, sort of throwing some sort of cocktail party called kill dash nine. Meanwhile, React was busy falling over anytime you tried to list keys in the database. So there was there's a lot of rough and tumble action in those days. Nowadays. I think people take partitions crashes, that sort of thing more seriously. I see a lot of folks at least tried to do some degree of testing for those. And yet, when I do consulting work, often I'll find databases where it looks like nobody tried to verify behavior during faults.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:56">0:04:56</a></span></p><p>And aside from Jepson, what are some of the other matters methods that people typically use for stress testing or evaluating the guarantees of these systems</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:05:06">0:05:06</a></span></p><p>and look at Jepsen, because it's an experimental approach as being one part of a complete breakfast continuum of quality methods. One of those is to start with a proven algorithm, some sort of abstract model of your system and either to have a hand or machine check proof of it, or at least a model checker, maybe with TLA. And if you are lucky, you can do some sort of code extraction with caulk or high level or cipher f HL with Isabel. But that's, that's not I think how most production systems get built. Most systems get built by pointing at a whiteboard and writing a bunch of code. And then your tools for Safety Analysis tend to be more along the lines of unit tests and integration tests. Jepsen takes a blackbox approach, which puts it sort of at the far end of integration testing other systems like Cassandra's D test suite Take a similar approach. You'll see people who do sort of manual testing where they do fault injection via somebody just running commands on the cluster or toggling some sort of hardware power switch, or network switch. That's the approach that's taken by foundation DB foundation. Devi also does a lot of automated simulation testing, where they will run a virtualized network with many simulated nodes in the same process and they can intercept messages and reorder them to get interesting results. So I think there's there's a lot of approaches people take to testing systems Jepson tries to general and who to work across many types of systems, which often means that it's not as deep or as capable as exploring the state space as a say a simulation test that's written specifically for the database that you're working on might be,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:06:46">0:06:46</a></span></p><p>and then as far as some of the real world usage of things like databases and other mission critical distributed systems, what are some of the real world impacts that can occur as a result of these failures that aren't properly vetted or properly guarded against,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:05">0:07:05</a></span></p><p>oh, you can get all kinds of faults, obviously, data could be lost. So you, you write something and then it just disappears later, you can have different nodes that compete on some version of the history. So maybe one person thinks that the list you're adding things to is 123, and other things, it's four or five, six, you can have temporal anomalies where you read some information from the past, instead of the present. You could have transactional violations where two transactions kind of land on top of each other or interleave, in some weird way. And all these systems that I've tested exhibit,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:40">0:07:40</a></span></p><p>typically one or more of these behaviors. The question is sort of how hard you have to push them to get there. And then in terms of the actual testing approach of using Jepsen for being able to find some of these error modes that exist in a particular system. What is your overall approach for business? Finding the test suite and customizing it for a given system. Because all of these different platforms will have different guarantees that they're trying to provide, or different approaches to linearize ability or serializability, or the strictness of the isolation that they provide. And I know that that provides a fairly extensive surface area to try and cover in any test suite. And I'm wondering just what your approaches for determining what are the key points to interact with. And then also any variability in the actual interfaces that are exposed by these systems for being able to interact with them and validate the correctness of the operations that are being performed?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:08:38">0:08:38</a></span></p><p>Yeah, you're quite right. There's there's sort of two huge surface areas to cover. One of them is the breadth of the API, all the different things databases do. Modern SQL databases have so many functions and so many interacting components that it's really difficult to predict, you know, how they're going to interact. And it also is tricky because when you get awkward misers into the mix. You know, depending on something like the size of your data, you might have two very different code paths that can evolve with different safety properties. So I don't have a good answer for that, you know, I write as many tests as I can in the time that I have. But that's usually just a tiny fraction of the overall API. My guiding principle is to …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-980">

<p>Let’s jump straight to the strange behavior: up until&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.configuration.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHP 7.2.16</a>&nbsp;it was possible by default to exfiltrate local files via the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySQL LOCAL INFILE feature</a> through the connection to a malicious MySQL server. Considering that the previous PHP versions are still <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the majority</a> in use, these exploits will remain useful for quite some time.</p>



<p>Like many other vulnerabilities, after reading about this&nbsp;<em>quite</em>-unknown attack technique (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2018/04/abusing-mysql-local-infile-to-read.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://russiansecurity.expert/2016/04/20/mysql-connect-file-read/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>), I could not wait to find a vulnerable software where to practice such unusual dynamic. The chance finally arrived after a network penetration test where&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/smaury92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@smaury</a>&nbsp;encountered&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.knowledgebase-script.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHPKB</a>, a knowledge-base software written in PHP which he felt might be interesting to review, and that was my trigger.&nbsp;😏</p>



<p>After deploying it and having a look at the source code, I noticed that during the installation it was possible to test the database connection before actually starting to use it. After going back to review my <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burp</a> HTTP history, I discovered that the API endpoint wasn’t protected or removed after the configuration was completed, and hence it remained available for any unauthenticated user forever after. A PHPKB patch was released shortly after my report and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MITRE</a> assigned it <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>.</p>



<p>Moving on to the exploitation technique, despite it being around for quite some time the malicious servers available weren’t neither really&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/allyshka/Rogue-MySql-Server/blob/master/rogue_mysql_server.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debug-friendly</a>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gist.github.com/bmaia/adc503231ffff19a77aaf0c7abd2e895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standalone</a>. That’s why I chose to invest some time to write one which met both those requirements — the result is available on&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ShielderSec/CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. The script can work in two main modes:&nbsp;<code>server-only</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>exploit</code>. The exploit mode just adds the HTTP GET request needed to trigger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>, while the server-only exposes the malicious MySQL instance and waits for connections. For example, we can now exfiltrate an arbitrary file from a vulnerable PHPKB host in just one command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Believe it or not, you can ship live birds and poultry with the <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/reviews/usps/">United States Postal Service</a>. However, there are quite a few guidelines you’ll need to follow when doing so. Lucky for you, we’re here to drop some knowledge so you’ll know <em>exactly what the cluck is going on</em>&nbsp;when it’s time for you to ship birds. Get it? Got it? Good. Time to spread your wings and dive in!</p>
<h3>You Must Use Priority Mail Express to Ship Birds with USPS</h3>
<p>First and foremost, speed is the name of the game when shipping birds. You need to ensure the birds reach their final destination <em>fast</em>—within&nbsp;72 hours, to be exact. That time limit is a regulation that USPS imposes themselves.&nbsp;Therefore, the only option you’ll have for shipping birds out of <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/choosing-right-usps-mail-class/">all the USPS mail classes</a> is <strong>Priority Mail Express</strong>.</p>
<h3>What Kind of Birds Can I Ship with USPS?</h3>
<p>Pretty much all kinds! You can ship disease-free adult birds, and you can ship chicks that are no more than one day (24 hours) old. If your chicks are older than a day, you’ll need to wait at least six weeks to ship them until they become <strong>juvenile birds</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why Can I Only Ship Chicks When They Are One Day Old?</h3>
<p>The answer lies in simple biology. Right before chicks hatch, they absorb the last of the yolk in the egg. This yolk creates energy stores that sustains the chicks for only up to three days. That’s exactly why chicks need to reach their final destination within 72 hours after hatching…and <em>that</em>‘s why you need&nbsp;to ship them within the first twenty-four hours, assuming you <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/the-fastest-way-to-ship-with-each-major-carrier/">ship Priority Mail Express for the fastest delivery possible</a> (1-2 days). For this same reason, shipping chicks that are more than a day old is prohibited because they don’t have enough energy stores to sustain them throughout their journey. Simply put, there’s a good chance the chicks will die if they are in transit for more than 72 hours.</p>
<p>If the day-old chicks in question are pheasants, keep in mind that you <strong>can only ship them between April and August</strong> (USPS’ rules, not ours). Similar to <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/how-to-ship-live-bees/">shipping honeybees</a>, pheasants are subject to freezing during the winter months.</p>
<p>For additional info on shipping day-old chicks, check out <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c5_008.htm">USPS’ regulations for mailable live animals</a>.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Shipping Adult Birds</h3>
<p>You can only ship adult birds under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You ship them Priority Mail Express</li>
<li>Each bird can’t weigh less than 6 ounces and can’t weigh more than 25 pounds</li>
<li>The number of birds per parcel must follow the container manufacturer limits</li>
<li>The total container weight can’t exceed 70 pounds</li>
<li>Food, such as sliced apples, must be in the container for the birds</li>
<li>You include wood shavings on the bottom of the container (at least a 1-2 inch layer)</li>
<li>You use a mailing container that is constructed by a USPS-approved manufacturer listed on <a href="https://postalpro.usps.com/">the PostalPro website</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Make Sure You Use the Right Kind of Box When Shipping Birds</h3>
<p>As we outlined in the above point, you can’t simply drop off live birds at the Post Office in a regular box. You’ll need a box that has holes in it for oxygen inflow, and it will need to be pre-approved for shipment by the Postal Service. A company called <strong>Horizon Micro-Environments</strong>&nbsp;actually manufactures USPS-approved boxes for shipping live birds, and you can&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hm-e.net/">pick some up on their website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In addition to your recipient’s address information, make sure you include their phone number on the box in case they need to be contacted for any reason during transit.</p>
<h3>Use Shipping Software to Save Money on Priority Mail Express Postage</h3>
<p>Using Priority Mail Express to ship live birds and poultry gets expensive. You’re paying for speed, after all. The good news is, you can <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/buy-postage-online/">use online shipping software to buy discounted postage</a>, and you’ll save yourself a lot of money! Most shipping software solutions offer <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/usps-discounts-postage-pricing-tiers/">USPS discounts such as Commercial Pricing</a>, even though the Postal Service typically reserves these savings for commercial shippers. All you need to do is purchase a postage label with shipping software, print it off, attach it to your box, and drop your box off at the Post Office. If you don’t want to leave your birds with the clerk behind the counter, you can also <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/schedule-usps-pickup/">schedule a time for a postal worker to pick up your package</a>.</p>
<h4>Make Sure to Weigh Your Container Accurately</h4>
<p>Postage for Priority Mail Express is based on weight, so if you’re buying postage at home, make sure you have an <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/how-can-i-weigh-packages-at-home/">accurate way to weigh your packages</a>. You don’t want to drop your package off or schedule a pickup only to find out that you need to pay more for the right amount of postage. Remember: when shipping birds, time is of the essence!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="divbodyholder">  <div id="divbody"> <div> <h3> Responsive deep work </h3> <p> July 28, 2020 — Chris Foster </p> <p>Remote work skills are more critical than ever and I’m feeling pretty lucky lately to have been working remotely the past few years. I used to summarize remote work as something that’s “great for some, but not for everyone”. I felt it would always collapse to one of two states:</p> <!-- Content Breaker --> <ol> <li>Intense, multi-day periods of long focus sessions</li> <li>Whole days of anxiously toggling notifications, social media, and email</li> </ol> <p>Neither of these are ideal. If you’re always jumping on every notification that comes up, you’ll finish the day feeling stressed and like you completed nothing. If you’re always in deep focus, you’ll be inacessible to your team and have a growing, daunting mound of notifications and tasks that you’ll be consistently ignoring. We want to be effective <strong>and</strong> responsive.</p> <p>Steve Streeting’s <a href="https://www.stevestreeting.com/2010/09/04/work-2-0/">“the interruptible programmer”</a> post touched on this idea. I wanted to share my approach too. I’ve found that a proper combination of planning, Pomodoros, and checklists has been great for creating deep focus space while ensuring no key communication is missed.</p> <h2 id="step-1-always-know-your-task">Step 1: Always know your task</h2> <p>Even the best practices for creating focus are useless if you’re focusing on the wrong thing. There’s a lot of methods which help with this, but at the core of them all is that <strong>you should always know what your task is</strong>. I personally use Bullet Journaling and timeboxing to do this.</p> <p><a href="https://clockify.me/timeboxing">Timeboxing</a> is the act of carefully planning your time and the tasks you’ll do in that time. I plan out the majority of my week on Sunday evening. It’s a flexible draft of a schedule, and depending on exactly how busy I am it might only be filled up 50% of the way. These are rough plans. Things like: when I’m going to do my workouts, which nights I’m cooking dinner, my work hours, etc.</p> <p>Each night I plan out the next calendar day carefully from 7am – 11pm. This is now a commitment to myself; I try not to change it if I can. There will be some adjustments along the way, and I update the calendar to match where my time went for reflection later.</p> <p>Timeboxing quantifies where my time is going, to make sure the hours I’m living are lined up with my priorities. Then, <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journaling</a> manages the details. At night, I start my next daily log and migrate up to five tasks into it. This gives me my goal for the next day: doing whatever those five tasks are, in the time boxes carved out in the calendar.</p> <p>Some of them are personal tasks, some are work tasks, and some are workouts. As the day progresses I’ll focus on whatever ones are related to the timebox I’m in at that moment.</p> <h2 id="step-2-create-focus-space-to-do-those-tasks">Step 2: Create focus space to do those tasks</h2> <p>With an organized plan, you need to execute. This can be easier said than done. You start your day with a great plan but an urgent email comes in, a slack notification pops up, you get a call from a friend, you help someone on your team with an impromptu meeting, and next thing you know it’s now 4pm and not one single thing is checked off your list.</p> <p>You have to do practice the next rule: <strong>spend most of your time ignoring everything except your current task</strong>. Pomodoros are a great tool to do that.</p> <p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoros</a>, the idea is simple: you spend 25 minutes of focus time working on a single task at a time, followed by a five minute break. After every four Pomdoros you take a longer, fifteen minute break.</p> <p>You can use your phone timer to do this, but apps can be handy for ease of use and tracking how many sessions you’ve done in a day. I use <a href="http://www.fohkuhs.com/">Fohkuhs</a>, but it’s kind of unmaintained and if I was recommending a new one I might use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470?mt=12">Be Focused</a>.</p> <p>When doing a Pomodoro, your computer should be on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchl999b7c1a/mac">Do Not Disturb</a>. Your phone should be on silent. You should not check Facebook, respond to or read notifications, or even use the washroom. If you break any of these rules, restart the Pomodoro from scratch. Get into the habit creating focus space for yourself for twenty-five minutes and it becomes second nature.</p> <p>This is where one of the perks of being remote comes in: you can easily create a space in which it’s really hard to interrupt you. Your home situation might require some tweaking to make this work, depending on what it is. Make sure your roommates, partner, etc. understand this.</p> <p>If absolutely necessary, try to quickly address an interruption by saying you’ll get back to them and note a task to do so into your Bullet Journal. If it’s urgent, you can get to it within 25 minutes by making it the task for the next Pomodoro.</p> <h3 id="step-3-use-checklists-to-manage-distractions">Step 3: Use checklists to manage distractions</h3> <p>Pomodoro was originally designed as a study method, so the five minute breaks were genuine breaks where you take a step away to relax. I’ve often heard people tell me that they struggle with Pomodoros once they start to get into the zone. They don’t <em>want</em> to stop for five minutes.</p> <p>What I’ve found to be the problem is not that the five minutes are a change in focus, it’s that it is a <em>break in flow</em>. It provides no guidance about what we do in that break. Instead, with checklists for your breaks, you make your breaks <em>part</em> of your flow.</p> <p>Unless you’re an <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">academic professor</a> with tons of time for deep work, or a student who can study uninterrupted at length, there are probably things which come up during the work day that you need to respond to. This is especially true for remote startup teams – while you’ve been heads down there’s now email, instant message, code reviews, and other things to attend to.</p> <p>We address these in the break. Breaks are for notifications, slack, email, quick replies, follow ups, and so on. Five minutes isn’t a lot of time and the modern world is filled with 101 different services that need your attention. To deal with that, we have rule three: <strong>have a checklist prioritizing the key flow during your break</strong>. Make notifications a workflow, not a distraction. This checklist will be very specific to each person, but here is what mine looks like:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/responsive-deep-work/pomodoro.png" alt="Pomodoro checklist"></p> <p>For the first few Pomodoros, it’s only a five minute break. Not a ton of time, but enough to sort through most notifications. When doing this, I follow the two-minute rule: anything that will take more than two minutes to deal with ends up as an additional item on the Bullet Journal. I might even decide that I need to spend the next Pomodoro focusing on it – that’s fine to do.</p> <p>The checklist is just a document in notion. I keep it open on my main space at all times. Alongside that I also keep a browser window with email and calendar open in pinned tabs. Slack too. I consider it my “notification space”. When I’m in a Pomodoro, even if it’s just one window I need, I <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh14112/mac">create a new space</a> and switch over to it so that no distractions are visible.</p> <p>Checklists are my favorite secret weapon. They’re great for offloading cognitive overhead. Use them for everything, even things that seem silly to use a checklist for. I have a morning checklist that I run through as my first Pomodoro of the day as well as an evening checklist I run through before bed. <a href="https://blog.nuclino.com/the-simple-genius-of-checklists-from-b-17-to-the-apollo-missions">Nuclino has a post about why they’re so great</a>.</p> <p>Sometimes — or typically — you won’t get all the way through the checklist. That’s totally fine. I usually get to at least working on some emails. The important part is to go back to focus time when the timer ends. I’ve noticed that notifications ebb and flow. Sometimes there are more and I fall behind on non-urgent things, sometimes there are less and I catch up on things naturally.</p> <p>When the break timer is up, start a new Pomodoro and switch back to focus time. If a new, additional item on the Bullet Journal is really important, it might be what I work on as my next Pomodoro. Typically I go back to what I was just doing though.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>One thing I really like about this system is that it’s very anti-producitivity-porn. The “tools” here consist of easily replaceable applications and a paper notebook. I’ve been doing tasks this way for a few years now and it no longer feels like I’m chasing “the next big productivity system”.</p> <p>In a day with a lot of meetings, I might maybe only get a few Pomodoros in. In a day with decent focus time I can get around 10. A really productive day might be up to 15. That five or more hours of deep work while keeping on top of messages with less than a 30 minute turnaround.</p> <p>I can absolutely imagine that this is not a system for everyone. It involves a lot of aggressive structure that won’t appeal to some, but productivity is a very personal thing and I like to think of rules as <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2017/07/wise-people-have-rules-for-themselves/">good decisions made in batches</a>. I’d love to hear what works for you <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisfosterelli">on Twitter</a>!</p>  </div>  </div> </div></div>]]>

I have to bring bank statements. I have to bring letters. [...] It's honestly like a humiliating and unnecessary process. And of course, they also make you pay for it."</p>    <p>The pandemic has prompted lawmakers around the world to close national borders, and no passport holders have regained the number of visa-free travel destinations they had prior to the pandemic.</p>  <p>"I think Americans, and honestly, the world can see what I've seen my whole life, which is that these borders are real, they're sharp and they hurt people," said Samarajiva.</p>  <p>"I can see the absurdity of the situation because [my] kids are basically the same.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="310ca8db" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
				<div>
			
<p>Have you heard about <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://jungletopp.com/instacart-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instacart featured products</a>? Chances are more users and marketers have heard of this platform within the last year, especially in 2020. And consumers actually have COVID-19 to thank (if you can believe you’re thanking a pandemic-inducing virus).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those that may not have heard of this platform before, Instacart is an online grocery shopping platform that delivers groceries right to your door. There are personalized shoppers sent out to go grab your order from stores that carry the items you requested. These stores include CVS Pharmacy, Wegmans and Costco among so many others! Pretty cool, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a store that ‘s increased tremendously in business in the past few months too. In March alone, online grocery store shopping went from <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/the-coronavirus-will-cause-a-lasting-step-change-in-grocery-ecommerce" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">11% to 37%</a>, which is a huge jump for the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, when we look into the opposite side of sales for the business and move on over to the marketing aspect, there’s a ton for marketers to take a deep dive. Instacart now uses Pacvue to offer self-serve advertising features in order to get their brand’s featured products to the mass market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pacvue is known for hosting advertising features for other monstrously huge companies such as Amazon and Walmart. When Instacart and Pacvue marry each other in the business of advertising, there’s quite a few features that can be achieved between the two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s look into these, shall we?&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Instacart Utilizes a Self-Serve Platform&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Instacart originally launched a self-serve advertising platform as a way to compete with other media outlets and other growing digital retailers. They include some of the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Amazon&nbsp;</li><li>CVS Pharmacy&nbsp;</li><li>Kroger&nbsp;</li><li>Target&nbsp;</li><li>Walmart&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Huge companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever and PepsiCo are among the brands that have actually tested the ad platform in the past few months, finding it to be of great value. Its marketplace ads include banners, coupons and delivery promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those to begin their own advertising campaign, marketers need to first set up an account through Instacart. By doing this, it will allow marketers to utilize measurement tools to track campaigns per the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This platform will also help marketers to reach shoppers when they are most ready to buy their groceries and complete the rest of the household shopping for the week. Since the pandemic hit, marketers have been able to highlight branded products on an online presence to customers that may have not seen them any other time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Where Do Instacart Ads Appear?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:369/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-2.jpg" alt="Instacart Featured Products" data-opt-src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:369/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-2.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20369%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22369%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E"></figure>



<p>Did you know Instacart offers feature product advertising? Customers will see these ads when they search for related keywords using the Instacart app. They can even search the home page or different department, browse through item details and even check out a personalized section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, the online shopper browses several times before making a purchase. They do this as a form of research, whether they ultimately purchase on the online platform or in stores. Since Instacart knows this, there are several opportunities for featured advertisements like the above to reach the desired audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take ketchup for instance. If someone is looking for a quality brand or one with certain ingredients, the customer might type in a few different keywords. Heinz Ketchup may then pop up for each one at the top. As the customer continues to search, they’ll then be more likely to purchase Heinz as it becomes more apparent as the top result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This feature is similar to Amazon, and conversion will most likely happen when the advertisements pop up at the top of the search.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Instacart Featured Products Use Keyword Bidding&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:156/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.57.06-PM.png" alt="instacart ad platform" data-opt-src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:156/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.57.06-PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20156%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22156%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E"></figure>



<p>This is a platform that uses auctioning and bids for specific keywords. Then the auction is won based on a combination of the CPC bid and relevance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a look into how it works! If you were to target “chocolate chip cookies” the keyword bid would only be applied to the exact phrase, and it wouldn’t be applied to variations like “chip cookies” or “chocolate chip cookie”.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>They Even Make Sure Your Keywords are Competitive&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Instacart is actually pretty similar to Amazon in the way they operate with their auction model. When marketers are bidding they’re only paying $.01 more than their competition. This particular setup is great for those who want to be competitive in their advertising without going way over their budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To show if you’ve won the bid, Instacart will rate keywords to show the probability of the advertiser winning them for the campaign. The system is also set to be viewed in real time, so you can see the change in bids.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Green, a high probability winning at least 50% of placements&nbsp;</li><li>Yellow, also a high probability of winning at least 25% of placements&nbsp;</li><li>Red, there is no chance of winning any placements</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How Does One Get Started with Instacart?</strong></h3>



<p>There’s four easy steps for getting set up with your own campaign, and you should as this can be super beneficial to your brand! Take a look at the following to see how you can achieve your start.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Learn How to Structure Your Campaigns: </strong>When creating a campaign, there’s actually no SKU limit you have to worry about. However, there is a keyword limit of 1,000 per ad group. But did you know you can have multiple ad groups in the same campaign?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Set Your Budget: </strong>Be conscious of your budget and make sure not to go over. This is best achieved when you set a date for the campaign and monitor spending within that budget you set for yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Exclude Certain Keywords from Campaigns: </strong>Make sure you monitor which words are serving you in the campaign. If the keyword isn’t doing as well as you hoped, you can lower the bid value to minimum in order to focus your efforts elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Get started ASAP: </strong>Instacart has grown tremendously in the last year due to the current pandemic and more shoppers are showing up on this platform. It’s important to get ahead of the game and get the opportunity to showcase your brand’ s voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have you tried out Instacart self-serve advertising before? Let us know what you think about the online platform or if you plan on using it yourself for future marketing campaigns!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQhhcgn8YZo" width="320" youtube-src-id="dQhhcgn8YZo"></iframe></p><p>Nanotechnology could impact gaming by enabling handhelds with better battery life, more immersive virtual reality and faster next gen consoles.&nbsp;</p><h2>Discovering nanotechnology</h2><p>Aged 14, I first discovered nanotechnology when I came across K. Eric Drexler's amazing&nbsp;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Creation" target="_blank">Engines of Creation</a></i>. In awe of his vision of an age of abundance where we could create anything using nothing but the dirt around us, I lent my copy to my Economics teacher, who was equally impressed at the potential for this wondrous new technology.</p><p>I almost forgot about it when I became an adult and the lure of other things was pulling me in. I'd dip my toes back in to that world whenever I read about a new application or someone was envisioning a new application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn't fully immersed and couldn't imagine the wonderful world of assemblers would happen anytime soon. We would still make things the old way, do things the old way. It was somewhat disheartening but this was reality, no matter how hard you could try to make it go away.&nbsp;</p><p>Lately, though, I've been thinking about technology a lot and how we are on the cusp of doing some amazing things. Developing games has, admittedly, narrowed my focus a little, so in this post I'll be exploring my thoughts for the potential of nanotechnology to transform gaming.&nbsp;</p><h3>Lighter, better handhelds</h3><p>One the major things holding back the potential for truly amazing handhelds (imagine a more powerful GPD Win that could play the latest games or a next generation Switch) is battery life.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding a bulky battery reduces the portability but nanotechnology offers the promise of next gen batteries in addition to improving existing tech.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a lot of research happening in this area (see this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.understandingnano.com/batteries.html" target="_blank">useful list of developments</a>, for example) but my favorite is the idea of using 'nanochains' to extend the lifespan of traditional lithium ion batteries.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.understandingnano.com/antimony-nanochain-battery.html" target="_blank">Researchers at Purdue University</a>&nbsp;conducted research using antimony based 'nanochains' which could lead to more powerful batteries: "The researchers compared the nanochain electrodes to graphite electrodes, finding that when coin cell batteries with the nanochain electrode were only charged for 30 minutes, they achieved double the lithium-ion capacity for 100 charge-discharge cycles."</p><p>These new batteries could lead to lighter handhelds with better CPUs and GPUs and longer battery life.&nbsp;</p><h3>New smells</h3><p>Ah,&nbsp;<i>Smell-O-Vision</i>. The butt of countless jokes since it failed, the idea of technology which could give your nose some type of enjoyment has long been the preserve of science fiction, but nanotechnology could make it happen.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Nanowerk News</i>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news/newsid=43476.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported on the NANOSMELL project&nbsp;</a>which could make this a reality. They wrote that: "The NANOSMELL project aims to switch smells on and off by tagging artificial odorants with nanoparticles exposed to electromagnetic field."</p><p>Gaming applications could be pretty cool if this could be made to work with a console or PC. You could be playing a new&nbsp;<i>Call of Duty</i>&nbsp;and be hit with smell of mud when running through a field or the smell of flowers when playing&nbsp;<i>Fable</i>. There's a lot that could be done.&nbsp;</p><h3>Less Bulky VR And Better Graphics</h3><p>Or what about a new type of skin that could be fantastic for virtual reality? You could feel every piece of the action in an FPS, the touchdown in a&nbsp;<i>Madden</i>&nbsp;game or the textures in a wood in an&nbsp;<i>Elder Scrolls</i>&nbsp;game.

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<figcaption>Pointillism I. Sublime Text 3.2.2, ImageMagick 7.0.8–59</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Pointillism II. Vim 8.0.1365, FFmpeg 4.1.4</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<pre><code>P3
# horizontal, vertical, perchannel

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif
</code></pre>

<figure>

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<figcaption>The Cobbler. Sublime Text 3.2.2, as 10.0.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<pre><code>w:h:5
fc:1
draw:{,(;,"blue";5 5#0)}
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Mu. English, Homo Sapiens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

</figure>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

					<div><h2>A brief history of keeping cool</h2><p>Humans have been trying to beat the heat since the beginning of civilization. For example people everywhere from the steppes of Kyrgyzstan to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona have been using a building material called adobe to keep their homes cool during the day and warm during the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the 20th century a New Yorker named Willis Carrier invented the first modern electric air conditioner. At first, units were expensive and bulky, so only large buildings like movie theaters had AC. But by the middle of the century costs and sizes dropped and adoption of in-home air conditioning skyrocketed in America.&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone was so quick to accept air conditioning, however. In fact, for a short time, the technology was morally controversial. As the Smithsonian’s Peter Liebhold wrote, “There was this notion that trying to control the environment was going against God’s will.”</p></div>

Ten years later in 1927, GE released the “Monitor-top” fridge, which would go on to sell one million units. By 1960 nearly every American home had a fridge.&nbsp;<span>Around that time the first window-unit air conditioner was invented, which made air conditioning more accessible.

					<div><h3>The solution isn’t as simple as turning down the thermostat</h3><p>It’s easy to dismiss air conditioning as an unnecessary comfort (especially if you grew up in a house without it, like I did). But for many air conditioning and other cooling technologies are a matter of life and death, especially in low-income countries.</p><p><strong>It protects against heat waves</strong></p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 12,000 people die from <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/energy/Publications/2018-clean-cold-report.pdf">heat waves</a> globally every year. Due to climate change, that number could rise as high as 250,000 as cities around the world heat up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It enables modern medicine</strong></p><p>Cooling technology is also essential to modern medicine. The WHO estimates that 150,000 people die every year due to broken “cold chains.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It prevents food-born illnesses</strong></p><p>If you haven’t had food poisoning recently, you can thank the cold chain. 420,000 people weren’t so lucky in the last year and died due to contaminated food.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

					<div><h3>How cooling technologies cause climate change</h3><p>While air conditioning and refrigerants make modern life possible, the greenhouse gases they emit contribute significantly to climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>These technologies cause climate change in two primary ways.</p><p><strong>Energy usage<br></strong>Air conditioners make up about 20% of electricity usage in the average American home. And today most of that electricity is generated from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Leaky hydrofluorocarbons</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>A lesser known cause of climate change are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).</p><p>Prior to the 1980s most AC units and fridges used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) coolants as a refrigerating fluid. But then scientists discovered their link to ozone depletion. In 1987 world leaders gathered in Montreal and agreed to ban the use of these gases (Ah, what a simple time… When world leaders listened to scientists).&nbsp;</p><p>Most companies replaced CFCs with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which was bad news for the stability of Earth’s climate. As a greenhouse gas these new HFCs are anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 times more potent than CO2. Today HFCs account for 1% of global emissions. But they are growing at an alarming rate of 10-15% per year.</p></div>

					<div><h3>The Most Effective Things You Can Do To Help Solve This Problem</h3>
<p>To take effective climate action you don’t need to be a climate scientist or policy wonk. Everyone reading this can do something to help reduce emissions from the cooling sector. Below I’ll cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>A summary of the best proposed solutions to this problem&nbsp;</li>
<li>The most effective steps you can take to be a part of the solution (ranked by impact)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The best proposed solutions</strong></p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, the UN released <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/33094/CoolRep.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">a report</a> detailing how we can cut 460 billion tons of cumulative global emissions over the next four decades. For context, that’s as many emissions as the world produces in eight years. The report can be broken down into two primary recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increase efficiency</strong> — Right now most cooling equipment sold isn’t the most efficient. In the United States the most efficient model on the market is 3x more efficient than the least.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Phase out HFCs</strong> — If we banned HFCs today like we did CFCs during the ozone crisis, we could avoid 53 billion tons of emissions over the next 40 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok so that’s what we — as in the big, global we — need to do. But what can me and you do?</p>
<p><strong>The most effective thing you can do is get involved politically.</strong></p>
<p>The most effective lever we as a world have to dramatically cut emissions is policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But before your eyes glaze over, hear me out. Policy isn’t some thing that wonks in windowless rooms write and then pass into law. Most barriers to policy are political. And most politicians don’t pass bold climate policy because they think you don’t want it (and many of them get lobbied by fossil fuel companies).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But no amount of fossil fuel money could prevent bold climate action if everyone who cared about the environment voted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today less than half of Americans vote. About a quarter of young people vote. So the most effective thing you can do is vote for green candidates, then get your friends to vote, and then organize your community to vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://erikareinhardt.com/personal-climate-action">Erika Reinhardt</a> put together a great guide on how to do this effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The second best thing you can do is reduce your home’s emissions</strong></p>
<p>The average American emits 20 tons of CO2 every year. About 5 of those come from your home. And the vast majority of those emissions come from three places: your air conditioning, heater, and hot water heater.</p>
<p>If you can afford to replace any of these pieces of equipment with more efficient equipment, you can make a big impact. But some of these systems cost thousands of dollars. So if you can’t just remember to prioritize efficiency when you eventually have to replace them. (In my next story I’m going to go over this in more detail).</p>
<p><strong>Don’t buy fridges or AC units with HFCs</strong></p>
<p>Remember how I mentioned that HFCs are 1,000-3,000 more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2? Well, the odds are pretty good that you have some of them in your house. That’s because most AC units and fridges sold until recently used them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And amazingly, while most countries have banned them, the United States hasn’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a quick guide to the good and bad ones to watch for:</p>

DNS-over-HTTPS isn’t used by Firefox and Google because it’s </span><i><span>superior</span></i><span> to DoT. It’s used because browsers operate at the HTTPS layer by default, so DNS-over-TLS doesn’t make sense (as things stand now) for a browser to implement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Google can’t use DNS-over-TLS in their browser because they can’t modify the code on Windows or MacOS operating systems (which only support DoT at the moment)&nbsp; in order to encrypt DNS requests done outside of the browser. And that works for Google and Firefox, because they only need to encrypt DNS requests </span><i><span>inside</span></i><span> of their browsers.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile at DNSFilter, we need to operate DNS encryption not just in the browser, but at the operating system level. That’s why we use DNS-over-TLS: Because it can be enabled at a </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> layer and protect DNS requests outside of the browser (e.g. Slack messages, links embedded in Excel, or miscellaneous desktop applications). And right now, DoT is the primary way to enable standardized DNS encryption at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Note that DoH is being enabled at the OS level for new versions of iOS, MacOS, and Windows. Because Android is a Google product, and Google Chrome uses DoH, Android devices are already using DoH at the operating system level.</span></p><h2><span>Which is better?</span></h2><p><span>DoH is on everyone’s minds because it’s what Google uses, but it’s not necessarily </span><i><span>better</span></i><span> than DoT. It’s just </span><i><span>different</span></i><span>, and in some ways it’s actually inferior to DoT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a lot of ways, DoT is more efficient because of which layer within the TCP/IP model it is enabled in. Remember, DoH is </span><b>two</b><span> layers removed from the internet layer while DoT is only </span><b>one</b><span> layer removed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because there is another layer of encapsulation in DoH, it results in:</span></p><ul><li><span>More coding required</span></li><li><span>More libraries required</span></li><li><span>Packet sizes are larger than DoT</span></li><li><span>Ever-so-slightly higher latency</span></li></ul><p><span>These are a few of the reasons why DNSFilter chose DoT over DoH. Basically, we would have needed to send more data across another layer. Though it should be noted that both DoT </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> DoH increase latency, DoT has lower latency because of where it’s enabled.</span></p><p><span>But the most important reason for us, and our users, in choosing DoT was the ability to enable DNS encryption at the </span><i><span>lowest possible layer</span></i><span> since our users do not just send DNS requests over their browsers. That’s why we use DoT.</span></p><p><span>But that doesn’t mean we think DoT is the </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> answer. We </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> planning on having a DoH implementation for clients who need it.</span></p><p><span>As an example, Android devices, such as Chromebooks, use DoH. This is because Android devices were created by Google. While Windows and MacOS do not currently support DoH, Google was able to modify their Android devices so that DoH would be possible.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-adding-dns-over-https-doh-to-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Microsoft has even announced adding support for DoH</span></a><span>, while also keeping their DoT support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though, just because Microsoft supports DoH for their operating system doesn’t mean the higher latency or additional coding requirements go away. No matter what, DoH is still implemented at a higher layer than DoT. The only change would be that now DoH can be implemented at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This addition of DoH support is likely less about Microsoft giving their users more options and more about them following Google’s lead.</span></p><h2><span>Other DNS protocol variations</span></h2><p><span>DoH and DoT are not the only encryption protocols available, though at this point they are more robust and the most widely used. But before encryption standards were available, there was also DNSSEC.</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC was an early DNS standard that provided </span><i><span>no</span></i><span> encryption or privacy for your DNS requests. It </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. And if it is not applied properly, it will </span><i><span>break</span></i><span> your website. </span><a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>You can check out a feed of websites broken by improper DNSSEC implementations here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC is prone to frequent outages and it was never widely adopted. Due to that, and because it only does a portion of what DoH and DoT do, are just a few reasons that at DNSFilter we don’t recommend using DNSSEC, though we do support it.</span></p><p><span>DNSCrypt is another DNS encryption option, though far less popular than the two protocols we’re comparing right now. Like DNS-over-TLS, it is applied at the transport layer. DNSCrypt prevents localized man-in-the-middle attacks and encrypts DNS traffic between the user and recursive DNS servers, though it does not provide end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the biggest difference between DNSCrypt and other standards (like DoT) is that there is no </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RFC</span></a><span> (Request for Comments) like there is for DoH or DoT. This means it hasn’t been peer-reviewed and battle-tested. Implementations can vary greatly, and all of the definitions and specifications for DNSCrypt come from a single source.</span></p><p><span>You can access the RFCs for </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoH</span></a><span> here.</span></p><h2><span>DNS encryption is </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> evolving</span></h2><p><span>There is no right answer when it comes to DoT or DoH, because these standards support varying use cases. But if DoH continues to be adopted like it has been, we might see DoT go by the wayside.</span></p><p><span>With that being said, it’s not just a matter of choosing DoT or DoH. There is still work that needs to be done in both DNS encryption </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> SNI (Server Name Indication) encryption.</span></p><p><span>SNI is the layer above TLS and an extension of the TLS layer. Once you make a DNS request and TLS makes a secure connection with that IP address, SNI tells the server in clear text (not encrypted) what the name of that domain is. While this does not impact things like man-in-the-middle attacks, it </span><i><span>does</span></i><span> impact privacy. Currently, SNI is </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> encrypted, though it is something that is being worked on.</span></p><p><span>While DoT and DoH are the most secure and standardized methods for encrypting DNS, they </span><i><span>do not</span></i><span> encrypt the request that goes to the authoritative DNS. That request is received in clear text. This is a point of vulnerability in both DoT and DoH, as well as DNSCrypt. Right now there is no standard for encrypting this information.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" alt="authoritative dns" width="600" height="145" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w"></p><p>As a DNS resolver, we support and welcome a standard for encrypting messages to authoritative DNS, and we’d love to work with providers to help put this in place.</p><p><span>But the point I’m trying to make here is that neither DoT nor DoH are perfect DNS encryption solutions at this moment. More work still needs to be done, like enabling 0-RTT for all DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS implementations.</span></p><p><span>While everyone is talking about DoH, it’s not because it’s the most secure or most efficient solution. It’s because right now, it’s the solution that’s getting the most press. </span><a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/why-vhs-beat-betamax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>When VHS overtook Betamax</span></a><span>, it wasn’t because VHS was better in every way. Betamax actually provided better video quality, but VHS was cheaper and allowed people to record longer programs. VHS and Betamax both achieve the same end (recording and displaying video), </span><a href="https://www.infosecmonkey.com/2019/11/19/betamax-doh-vs-vhs-dot-in-the-secure-dns-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>similar to how DoT and DoH both provide encryption</span></a><span> through slightly different methods.</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest impacts of the “DoH vs. DoT” debate is the way MSPs implement network-level DNS filtering. With DoH becoming the de facto standard, it makes performing DoH bypasses on system-level DNS settings nearly impossible. There’s no standard method at this time for alternative workarounds. We’ll go into this subject in more detail in a later blog post, as there is a lot to consider when discussing the impact on MSPs.</span></p><p><span>For more reading on DNS-over-TLS and how it’s implemented by DNSFilter, </span><a href="https://docs.dnsfilter.com/docs/dns-over-tls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>visit our support documentation</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

</ul>
<img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/2805509/driving-radius.jpg" width="620" alt="commute-radius-paris">
<p>You can add more than one start location to your commute time map to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat sharing: plot all work locations for all flatmates to see which locations would provide the best commute</li>
<li>Family home search: plot school locations and work locations to see where's a good spot for all of the family</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use our commute calculator</h2>
<p>1. Open our <a href="https://app.traveltime.com/" rel=" noopener"><strong>free commute map tool</strong></a> - no sign up required&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Enter a start location, such as your office, a school, your current home location or somewhere else important&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/2805509/Screenshot%202020-07-28%20at%2015.36.00.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020-07-28 at 15.36.00" width="1274"></p>
<p>3. Select your maximum commute time. This free tool allows you to select a time up until 2 hours, using 5 minute increments. For example 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour 15 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: it's possible to make a commute map using 2+ hours travel time, but can't be done using this demo tool. To do this you'll need to use the <a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/api/overview/introduction" rel=" noopener"><strong>TravelTime API</strong></a> or <strong><a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/qgis/tutorials/basic-tutorial" rel=" noopener">QGIS plugin </a></strong>or <strong><a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/arcgis/about/overview" rel=" noopener">ArcGIS plugin</a></strong>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>4. Select your preferred mode of transport. To understand <strong><a href="https://traveltime.com/turn-radius-maps-into-travel-time" rel=" noopener">how we calculate each transport mode area view our model here.</a></strong></p>

<p>When selecting public transport the tool calculates commute time area based on how long it takes to depart your start location and get on any timetabled transport mode. The user then must have time to reach the stop and exit the station on the other side. This sometimes means that a 30 minute area looks different at slightly different times of the day.&nbsp;</p>

July 28, 2020 | https://mlu.red/muse/52906366310.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mlu.red/muse/52906366310.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog post is my attempt to give an overview of the sub-field of machine learning interpretability. I do not intend for this post to be necessarily comprehensive, but my goal is to review conceptual frameworks, existing research, and future directions.</p>
<h2>What Are Existing Overviews?</h2>
<p>Most of these ideas are based heavily off of Zach Lipton's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf">Mythos of Model Interpretability</a>, which I think is the best paper for understanding the different definitions of interpretability. For a deeper dive into specific techniques, I recommend <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01933.pdf">A Survey Of Methods For Explaining Black Box Models</a> which covers a wide variety of approaches for many different ML well as model-agnostic approaches. For neural nets specifically, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14545.pdf">Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated</a> provides an in-depth read. For other conceptual surveys of the field, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/44/22071">Definitions, methods, and applications in interpretable machine learning</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08883.pdf">Explainable Machine Learning for Scientific Insights and Discoveries</a>. The Explainable Machine Learning paper in particular is quite nice because it gives a hierarchy of increasingly more interpretable models across several domains and use cases.</p>
<p>(Shout-out to <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/d516daff247f7157fccde6649ace91d969cd1973/The-Mythos-of-Model-Interpretability/">Connected Papers</a> which made navigating the paper landscape for interpretability very bearable.)</p>
<p>As always, you can find code used to generate the images <a href="https://github.com/owenshen24/interp-exp">here</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we'll go over many ways to formalize what "interpretability" means. Broadly, interpretability focuses on the <em>how</em>. It's focused on getting some notion of an explanation for the decisions made by our models. Below, each section is operationalized by a concrete question we can ask of our ML model using a specific definition of interpretability. Before that, though, if you're new to all this, I'll explain briefly about why we might care about interpretability at all.</p>
<h2>Why Care About Interpretability?</h2>
<p>Firstly, interpretability in ML is useful because it can aid in trust. As humans, we may be reluctant to rely on ML models for certain critical tasks , e.g. medical diagnosis, unless we know "how they work". There's often a fear of unknown unknowns when trusting in something opaque, which we see when people confront new technology. Approaches to interpretability which focus on transparency could help mitigate some of these fears.</p>
<p>Secondly, safety. There is almost always some sort of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v1.pdf">shift in distributions</a> between model training and deployment. Failures to generalize or Goodhart's Law issues like <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-AI-ingenuity">specification gaming</a> are still open problems that could lead to issues in the near future. Approaches to interpretability which explain the model's representations or which features are most relevant could help diagnose these issues earlier and provide more opportunities to intervene.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and perhaps most interestingly, contestability. As we delegate more decision-making to ML models, it becomes important for people to appeal these decisions made. Black-box models provide no such recourse because they don't decompose into anything that <em>can</em> be contested. This has already led to major criticism of proprietary recidivism predictors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software)#Critiques_and_legal_rulings">COMPAS</a>. Approaches to interpretability which focus on decomposing the model into sub-models or explicate a chain of reasoning could help with such appeals.</p>

<p>Lipton's paper breaks interpretability down into two types, transparency and post-hoc.</p>
<h2>Transparency Interpretability</h2>
<p>These three questions are from Lipton's section on transparency as interpretability, where he features on properties of the model that are useful to understand and can be known before training begins.</p>
<h3>Can a human walk through the model's steps? (Simulatibility)</h3>
<p>This property is about whether or not a human could go through each step of the algorithm and have it make sense to them at each step. Linear models and decision trees are often cited as interpretable models using such justifications; the computation they require is simple, no fancy matrix operations or nonlinear transformations.</p>
<p>Linear models are also nice because the parameters themselves have a very direct mapping–they represent how important different input features are. For example, I trained a linear classifier on MNIST, and here are some of the weights, each of which correspond to a pixel value:</p>
<pre><code>0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  3.90594519e-05,  7.10306823e-05,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00, -1.47542413e-03,
-1.67811041e-04, -3.83280468e-02, -8.10846867e-02, -5.01943218e-02,
-2.90314621e-02, -2.65494116e-02, -8.29385683e-03,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  1.67390785e-04,  3.92789141e-04,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00
</code></pre>
<p>By themselves, these weights are hard to interpret. Even if we knew which pixels they corresponded to, it's difficult to try and pin down what a certain pixel even represents for large images. However, there is an easy trick to turn these weights into something interpretable. We simply reshape them into the same shape as our model and view it as an image, with the pixel color represented by the weight value.</p>
<p>Here are the weights for the model that looks for 0:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-0.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 0 highlighted"></p>
<p>And here are the weights for the model that looks for 3:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-3.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 3 highlighted"></p>
<p>In both cases, we can see that the blue regions, which represent positive weight, correspond to a configuration of pixels that look roughly like the digit being detected for. In the case of 0, we can see a distinct blank spot in the center of the image and a curve-like shape around it, whereas the curves of the 3 are also apparent.</p>
<p>However, Lipton points out that this desiderata can be less about the specific choice of model and more about the <em>size</em> of the model. A decision tree with a billion nodes, for example, may still be difficult to understand. Understanding is also about being able to hold most of the model in your mind, which is often about how the model is parameterized.</p>
<p>One approach towards achieving this for neural nets is <a href="http://www.shallowmind.co/jekyll/pixyll/2017/12/30/tree-regularization/">tree regularization</a> which adds a regularization term that corresponds (roughly) to the size of the decision tree that can approximate the net being trained. The hope here is to eventually output a shallow decision tree that performs comparably to a neural net. Another approach is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00221.pdf">neural backed decision trees</a> which use another type of regularization to learn a hierarchy over class labels, which then get used to form a decision tree.</p>
<p>Of course, parameterization is not the whole story. There are methods like K-Nearest Neighbors which are parameterized by your entire dataset; this could be billions of points. Yet, there is a sense in which KNN is still interpretable despite its massive size. We can cleanly describe what the algorithm does, and we can even see "why" it made such a choice because the algorithm is so simple.</p>
<h3>Is the model interpretable at every step, or with regards to its sub-components? (Decomposability)</h3>
<p>Another desirable feature would be to understand what the model is doing at each step. For example, imagine a decision tree whose nodes correspond to easily identifiable factors like age or height. This can sometimes be difficult because model performance is very tightly coupled with the representations used. Raw features, e.g. RGB pixel values, are often not very interpretable by themselves, but interpretable features may not be the most informative for the model.</p>
<p>For example, I trained a decision tree for MNIST using the following interpretable features:</p>
<ol>
<li>The average brightness of the image - <code>avg_lumin</code></li>
<li>The average brightness of the image's outline (found using an edge detector) - <code>edge_prop</code></li>
<li>The number of corners found in the image's outline <code>num_corners</code></li>
<li>The width of the image - <code>max_width</code></li>
<li>The height of the image - <code>max_height</code></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems like there would be at least <em>some</em> useful information in these features; ones tend to have less area (so <code>avg_lumin</code> would be lower), eights might have more corners, etc. etc. Yet, the resulting decision tree of depth 3, shown below, however, only achieves 33% training accuracy. Going all the way to depth 10 only bumps it to around 50%.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/interp_mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a decision tree trained on MNIST with interpretable features"></p>
<p>If we look at the nodes, we can perhaps see what's going on. At the top, we can see that our model will predict a 1 if the width is less than 7.5 pixels, which makes sense as 1 is likely going to be the thinnest digit. Near the bottom, we see that the number of corners is being used to differentiate between 7 and 4. And 4s do have more visual corners than 7s. But this is very rough, and the overall performance is still not very good.</p>
<p>To compare this with raw features, I also trained a depth 3 decision tree using direct pixel values, i.e. a vector of 784 grayscale values. The resulting model, shown below, gets 50% train and test accuracy.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a normal decision tree trained on MNIST"></p>
<p>Here, it's not clear at all why these pixel values were chosen to be the splitting points. And yet the resulting decision tree, for the same number of nodes, does much better. In this simple case, the performance vs interpretability trade-off in representation is quite apparent.</p>
<h3>Does the algorithm itself confer any guarantees? (Algorithmic Transparency)</h3>
<p>This asks if our learning algorithm has any properties which make it easy to understand. For example, we might know that the algorithm only outputs sparse models, or perhaps it always converges to a certain type of solution. In these cases, the resulting learned model can be more amenable to analysis. For example, the <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Labs/UniquenessOfSVM.pdf">Hard Margin SVM</a> is guaranteed to find a unique solution which maximizes the margin. In another vein, the <a href="https://owenshen24.github.io/perceptron/">perceptron</a> is guaranteed to find parameters (not necessarily unique ones, though) that achieve a training loss of 0 if the data are linearly separable.</p>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, I'm less familiar with these kinds of results. My rough understanding is that the equivalence class of models which achieve comparable training error can be quite large, even with regularization, which makes uniqueness results hard to come by.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier with KNN, it seems, aside from mechanical transparency, …</p></div></div>

                    <p>It takes a while to gather, clean and train your model. Optimizing hyper-parameters, fine tuning, searching for the best architecture takes a while. After all that hard work, it's finally time to deploy your model. </p><p>Supposing you trained a very accurate model. In this short tutorial you'll learn how to deploy that Scikit model to the Inferrd platform. It's very easy and fast.</p><h3 id="let-s-get-started">Let's Get Started</h3><p>The first step in deploying a model to the cloud is saving that model. You need to get your Scikit model into a format that is easily uploadable. Thankfully, it's literally a one-liner.</p><p>All you need is the <code>joblib</code> library, a simple serialization package that takes care of everything.</p><pre><code>pip install joblib</code></pre><p>Then, simply dump your model into a file called <code>my_scikit_model.joblib</code></p><pre><code>import scikit
from joblib import dump

model = # define your model and train it

# more training involved
dump(model, 'my_scikit_model.joblib')
</code></pre><p>At this point, you should have a file called <code>my_scikit_model.joblib</code>.</p><h3 id="second-and-final-step">Second and Final Step</h3><p>That <code>.joblib</code> file is all you need for Inferrd. Simply head over to <a href="https://app.inferrd.com/register">your dashboard</a>, create a new model and drop that <code>joblib</code> file in the upload zone.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 600w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Give Inferrd around one minute to fully deploy your model.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a data company, data ethics has always been important to us, but in the last few years, as Machine learning and AI have become front and centre as a significant part of digital transformation in the enterprise, data ethics has become a hot topic. It bears such a considerable weight in predictive analytics, not just in conveying trust to consumers of machine intelligence, but also in ensuring predictive models deliver genuine value, make unbiased predictions, and reflect the true state of the environment within which they live. When data ethics go wrong, it can go badly wrong, potentially bringing down an entire organisation, with substantial direct and indirect collateral damage, potentially even on national democracy and social cohesion - the Cambridge Analytica incident a case in point.</p><p>We all need to take it seriously.</p><p>In 2018 Data Language was privileged to have been accepted onto the Digital Catapult “<a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/for-startups/acceleration-programmes/machine-intelligence-garage">Machine Intelligence Garage</a>” programme. As well as supporting us with a terrific programme including compute resource, strategic help and industry engagement, Digital Catapult also took Data Language through their ethics programme. This was like a cold-shower, really waking us up to depth and breadth of data ethics. A realisation that data ethics is not just about data (technically), but about the way you approach your entire business. </p><p>With all this in mind, we were motivated to develop a data ethics framework that we could use internally at Data Language to assess all our predictive analytics projects, and that could guide us practically during implementation. We call this framework BOTT.</p><h2 id="the-bott-framework">The BOTT Framework</h2><p>BOTT (all good frameworks need a memorable acronym) stands for Bias, Outcome, Target and Trust. Through these four pillars, it allows our data science team to examine, and assess a predictive analytics model within its local and external ecosystem for quality, bias, and accuracy, and ensure it meets high standards of data ethics.</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg" alt="Data Language BOTT Data Ethics Framework" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1000/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1000w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w2400/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="bias">Bias</h3><p>An analysis of potential bias that may be baked into the model during its life-cycle, either literally through data or code, or intangibly through for example, some conscious or subconscious human bias. We examine bias from the following perspectives :</p><p><em><strong>Training data bias</strong></em> - is the training data diverse enough and comprehensive enough to accurately reflect the environment of the predictive model. What potential biases might skew predictive results either for good or bad outcomes - is there any chance these biases might exist in the training data we have used.</p><p><em><strong>Algorithmic bias</strong></em><strong> </strong>- is the model algorithm, its mathematical basis, or code potentially biased?</p><p><em><strong>Real-time input data</strong></em><strong> </strong>- if real-time (predict time) input data is involved in making some prediction, what might these data biases be, and how can we prevent them from impacting outputs.</p><p><strong><em>Team bias</em></strong> - has or could conscious or unconscious bias of the model development team contribute to model bias, and have we mitigated against it. Often just an open and frank team discussion around bias (with respect to the project under consideration) is enough to flush out these sort of issues</p><p><strong><em>Political, environmental, and social bias</em> </strong>- similar to the team bias but looking at potential external factors through a similar lens - for both ideally the team needs to be very comfortable talking about potentially politically or socially sensitive topics in an open, friendly and non-defensive manner.</p><p><strong><em>Output sampling</em></strong> - essentially QA - have you done effective output sampling and for quality assurance - does the risk of bias in the predictive model call for independent third party reviews in QA workflows, etc</p><h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3><p>An analysis and survey of the full range of possible outcomes of the model:</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - construct a catalogue of the potential outcome scenarios</p><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - What does success and failure of the model mean :</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>in the context of the target use-cases</li>
<li>best and worst case scenario modelling</li>
<li>model failure consequences, e.g. could somebody die if the model fails ?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="target">Target</h3><p>Analysis of who or what the model is targeted at and the context in which these users operate.</p><p><strong><em>Users</em></strong> - &nbsp;Who are target users of the model &nbsp;- who or what is the direct consumer of the model ?</p><p><strong><em>Purpose</em></strong> - What problem is the model solving?</p><p><strong><em>Context</em>: </strong>Is it part of an ensemble of models, is there a wider predictive ecosystem the model sits within - what impact does this model have within this context ?</p><p><strong><em>Life span</em></strong> - &nbsp;What is the life expectancy of the model, and how does its environment change over time</p><p><strong><em>Subversion</em> </strong> - Can other users or consumers subvert the model for unintended/undesirable ends?</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - Construct &nbsp;a catalogue of potential unintended uses/consequences, and ascertain if those vulnerabilities can be designed out of the architecture?</p><h3 id="trust">Trust</h3><p>Providing some visibility of the "behind the scenes" implementation can raise confidence in the models and foster a trust relationship between consumers and predictive services.</p><p><strong><em>Explainable AI</em></strong> (XAI) is becoming a field in its own right, and an important part of machine learning and predictive analytics. Codable frameworks are emerging to aid explainability (for example <a href="https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about">Google Model Cards</a>). This codability will be key in being able to compare and assess models through some normative evaluation mechanism.</p><p><strong><em>Transparency</em></strong> &nbsp;- what should we be exposing of the lineage and decision making pipeline of the model prediction algorithm :</p><ul><li>training cycles / training samples</li><li>outputs of intermediate predictions</li><li>decision inputs/outputs</li></ul><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - Why should these be exposed ? - perform an impact analysis of the possible effects of not exposing model lineage, with respect to legal, environmental, and model improvement consequences.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Most of the programming languages are open enough to allow programmers doing things multiple ways for the similar outcome. JavaScript is no way different. With JavaScript, we often find multiple ways of doing things for a similar outcome, and that's confusing at times.</p>
<p>Some of the usages are better than the other alternatives and thus, these are my favorites. I am going to list them here in this article. I am sure, you will find many of these in your list too.</p>
<h2 id="1-forget-string-concatenation-use-template-string-literal-">1. Forget string concatenation, use template string(literal)</h2>
<p>Concatenating strings together using the <code>+</code> operator to build a meaningful string is old school. Moreover, concatenating strings with dynamic values(or expressions) could lead to frustrations and bugs.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageConcat = <span>'Mr. '</span> + name + <span>' is from '</span> + place + <span>'. He is a'</span> + <span>' '</span> + isPrime(<span>'P'</span>) + <span>' member.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Template literals(or Template strings) allow embedding expressions. It has got unique syntax where the string has to be enclosed by the backtick (``).  Template string can contain placeholders for dynamic values. These are marked by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}).</p>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating it,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageTemplateStr = <span>`Mr. <span>${name}</span> is from <span>${place}</span>. He is a <span>${isPrime('P')}</span> member.`</span>
<span>console</span>.log(messageTemplateStr);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-isinteger">2. isInteger</h2>
<p>There is a much cleaner way to know if a value is an integer. The <code>Number</code> API of JavaScript provides a method called, <code>isInteger()</code> to serve this purpose. It is very useful and better to be aware.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> mynum = <span>123</span>;
<span>let</span> mynumStr = <span>"123"</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynum}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynum));
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynumStr}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynumStr));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930285107/RiLxixUxC.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="2.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-value-as-number">3. Value as Number</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed, <code>event.target.value</code> always returns a string type value even when the input box is of type number?</p>
<p>Yes, see the example below. We have a simple text box of type number. It means it accepts only numbers as input. It has an event handler to handle the key-up events.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>input</span> <span>type</span>=<span>'number'</span> <span>onkeyup</span>=<span>"trackChange(event)"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the event handler method we take out the value using <code>event.target.value</code>. But it returns a string type value. Now I will have additional headache to parse it to an integer. What if the input box accepts floating numbers(like, 16.56)? parseFloat() then? Ah, all sort of confusions and extra work!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>trackChange</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   <span>let</span> value = event.target.value;
   <span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(value));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>event.target.valueAsNumber</code> instead. It returns the value as number.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> valueAsNumber = event.target.valueAsNumber;
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(valueAsNumber));
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595935455526/Tv1sEFRxe.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="3.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-short-hand-with-and">4. Short hand with AND</h2>
<p>Lets consider a situation where we have a boolean value and a function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isPrime = <span>true</span>;
<span>const</span> startWatching = () =&gt; {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Started Watching!'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is too much code to check for the boolean condition and invoke the function,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (isPrime) {
    startWatching();
}
</code></pre>
<p>How about using the short-hand using the AND(&amp;&amp;) operator? Yes, avoid <code>if</code> statement altogether. Cool, right?</p>
<pre><code>isPrime &amp;&amp; startWatching();
</code></pre>
<h2 id="5-default-value-with-or">5. Default value with OR</h2>
<p>If you ever like to set a default value for a variable, you can do it using the OR(||) operator easily.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> person = {name: <span>'Jack'</span>};
<span>let</span> age = person.age || <span>35</span>; 
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`Age of <span>${person.name}</span> is <span>${age}</span>`</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="6-randoms">6. Randoms</h2>
<p>Generating random number or getting a random item from an array are very useful methods to keep handy. I have seen them appearing multiple times in many of my projects.</p>
<p>Get a random item from an array,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> planets = [<span>'Mercury '</span>, <span>'Mars'</span>, <span>'Venus'</span>, <span>'Earth'</span>, <span>'Neptune'</span>, <span>'Uranus'</span>, <span>'Saturn'</span>, <span>'Jupiter'</span>];
<span>let</span> randomPlanet = planets[<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * planets.length)];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>'Random Planet'</span>, randomPlanet);
</code></pre>
<p>Generate a random number from a range by specifying the min and max values,</p>
<pre><code> <span>let</span> getRandom = (min, max) =&gt; {
     <span>return</span> <span>Math</span>.round(<span>Math</span>.random() * (max - min) + min);
 }
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Get random'</span>, getRandom(<span>0</span>, <span>10</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="7-function-default-params">7. Function default params</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, function arguments(or params) are like local variables to that function. You may or may not pass values for those while invoking the function. If you do not pass a value for a param, it will be <code>undefined</code> and may cause some unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>There is a simple way to pass a default value to the function parameters while defining them. Here is an example where we are passing the default value <code>Hello</code> to the parameter <code>message</code> of the <code>greetings</code> function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name, message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>));
<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>, <span>'Hola!'</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="8-required-function-params">8. Required Function Params</h2>
<p>Expanding on the default parameter technique, we can mark a parameter as mandatory. First define a function to throw an error with an error message,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isRequired = () =&gt; {
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>'This is a mandatory parameter.'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then assign the function as the default value for the required parameters. Remember, the default values are ignored when a value is passed for a parameter at the invocation time. But, the default value is considered if the parameter value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name=isRequired(), message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;
}
<span>console</span>.log(greetings());
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, <code>name</code> will be undefined and that will try to set the default value for it which is the <code>isRequired()</code> function. It will throw an error as,</p>

<h2 id="9-comma-operator">9. Comma Operator</h2>
<p>I was surprised when I realized, comma(,) is a separate operator and never gone noticed. I have been using it so much in code but, never realized its true existence.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the comma(,) operator is used for evaluating each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> count = <span>1</span>;
<span>let</span> ret = (count++, count);
<span>console</span>.log(ret);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the value of the variable <code>ret</code> will be, 2.  Similar way, the output of the following code will be logging the value 32 into the console.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> val = (<span>12</span>, <span>32</span>);
<span>console</span>.log(val);
</code></pre>
<p>Where do we use it? Any guesses? The most common usage of the comma(,) operator is to supply multiple parameters in a for loop.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i = <span>0</span>, j = <span>50</span>; i &lt;= <span>50</span>; i++, j--)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="10-merging-multiple-objects">10.  Merging multiple objects</h2>
<p>You may have a need to merge two objects together and create a better informative object to work with. You can use the spread operator <code>...</code>(yes, three dots!).</p>
<p>Consider two objects, emp and job respectively,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emp = {
 <span>'id'</span>: <span>'E_01'</span>,
 <span>'name'</span>: <span>'Jack'</span>,
 <span>'age'</span>: <span>32</span>,
 <span>'addr'</span>: <span>'India'</span>
};

<span>let</span> job = {
 <span>'title'</span>: <span>'Software Dev'</span>,
  <span>'location'</span>: <span>'Paris'</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Merge them using the spread operator as,</p>
<pre><code> 
 <span>let</span> merged = {...emp, ...job};
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Spread merged'</span>, merged);
</code></pre>
<p>There is another way to perform this merge. Using <code>Object.assign()</code>. You can do it like,</p>
<pre><code> <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Object assign'</span>, <span>Object</span>.assign({}, emp, job));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930544621/2jCCxCSnz.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="10.png"></p>
<p>Note, both spread operator and the Object.assign perform a shallow merge. In a shallow merge, the properties of the first object are overwritten with the same property values of the second object.</p>
<p>For deep merge, please use something like, <code>_merge</code> of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a>.</p>
<h2 id="11-destructuring">11. Destructuring</h2>
<p>The technique of breaking down the array elements and object properties as variables called, <code>destructuring</code>.  Let us see it with few examples,</p>
<h3 id="array">Array</h3>
<p>Here we have an array of emojis,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>To destructure, we would use a syntax as follows,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fire, clock, , watermelon] = emojis;
</code></pre>
<p>This is same as doing, <code>let fire = emojis[0];</code> but with lots more flexibility.
Have you noticed, I have just ignored the trophy emoji using an empty space in-between? So what will be the output of this?</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(fire, clock, watermelon);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595931639636/TXaeEwgGq.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.png"></p>
<p>Let me also introduce something called <code>rest</code> operator here. If you want to destructure an array such that, you want to assign one or more items to variables and park rest of it into another array, you can do that using <code>...rest</code> as shown below.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fruit, ...rest] = emojis;
<span>console</span>.log(rest);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932001526/GdWuvDoP8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.a.png"></p>
<h3 id="object">Object</h3>
<p>Like arrays we can also destructure objects. </p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> shape = {
  name: <span>'rect'</span>,
  sides: <span>4</span>,
  height: <span>300</span>,
  width: <span>500</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Destructuring such that, we get name, sides in couple of variables and rest are in another object.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> {name, sides, ...restObj} = shape;
<span>console</span>.log(name, sides);
<span>console</span>.log(restObj);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932176160/97vWj-QQl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.b.png"></p>

<h2 id="12-swap-variables">12. Swap variables</h2>
<p>This must be super easy now using the concept of <code>destructuring</code> we learned just now.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> fire = <span>'🔥'</span>;
<span>let</span> fruit = <span>'🍉'</span>;

[fruit, fire] = [fire, fruit];
<span>console</span>.log(fire, fruit);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="13-isarray">13. isArray</h2>
<p>Another useful method for determining if an input is an Array or not.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(emojis));

<span>let</span> obj = {};
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(obj));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="14-undefined-vs-null">14. undefined vs null</h2>
<p><code>undefined</code> is where a value is not defined for a variable but, the variable has been declared. </p>
<p><code>null</code> itself is an empty and non-existent value which must be assigned to a variable explicitly.</p>
<p><code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> are not strictly equal,</p>
<pre><code><span>undefined</span> === <span>null</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Read more about this topic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript">from here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="15-get-query-params">15. Get Query Params</h2>
<p><code>window.location</code> object has bunch of utility methods and properties. We can get information about protocol, host, port, domain etc from the browser urls using these properties and methods. </p>
<p>One of the properties that I found very useful is,</p>
<pre><code><span>window</span>.location.search
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>search</code> property returns the query string from the location url. Here is an example url: <code>https://tapasadhiary.com?project=js</code>. The <code>location.search</code> will return, <code>?project=js</code></p>
<p>We can use another useful interface called, <code>URLSearchParams</code> along with <code>location.search</code> to get the value of the query parameters.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> project = <span>new</span> URLSearchParams(location.search).get(<span>'project'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:
<code>js</code></p>

<div><p>A common perception of artificial intelligence is often different from real life. One imagines an intelligent robot which is making its own decisions, finds problems, and eventually takes over the humans. In reality, AI may be practically invisible in a software system. However, it does make a huge difference.</p></div>
<p>Imagine you are a realtor spending your typical workday at the office. You get overloaded with chunks of data about your clients. So once a new customer turns to you, you show him a generic company presentation and promise to call back once a matching property appears.</p>

<p><br>Thankfully, those days are gone.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using AI-based software, you can dramatically transform the way you serve the same customer. By putting in dozens of search criteria, you get instant results about available houses in real-time. Furthermore, you can offer personalized listings before the customer even turns to you. Learning about life events such as customer marriage, you can send the automated message sequence. You donâ€™t need to spend hours on manual research and analysis since AI will do the job for you.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us compare the brightest ideas of AI real estate apps and how they <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/top-11-emerging-tech-trends-in-real-estate/" target="_blank">simplify the real estate business</a>.</p>

<h2>Top AI real estate apps &amp; startups to learn from</h2>
<h2><strong>1. TRIRIGA</strong></h2>
<div><p>Launched by IBM, the TRIRIGA application uses AI in real estate to efficiently manage office space. The system learns how people are actually using space, collecting this data from various sources such as Wi-Fi and connected sensors. Then this info is presented in an easy-to-digest format. </p></div>
<p>The goal of the application is to manage workspaces wisely and cut on room wastage. This practice, in turn, can lead to significant cost savings for organizations. 30 to 40% of workspaces are currently underused according to the JLL report. In terms of cost-efficiency, this can result in thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>A smart AI assistant can then anticipate staff needs and reorganize building layouts accordingly. The cherry on top, you can engage with the system by only using your voice.</p>

<p>This is the case when artificial intelligence actually looks like robots. Doxel startup serves teams and projects still under construction. Autonomous machines track installed items and automatically measure the earned value for each item. You can see the construction site in 3D, view an updated progress report, and see the completion stats.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is most important, you can instantly see the installation errors thanks to the AI engine. The system claims to save around 11% of overall budgets and grow team productivity by 38%.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>Houzen is a must-have tool for homeowners who need to find the agent fast. It filters realtors by success rates, local expertise, and accreditations, selecting them within 24 hours. This tool is quite simple to use &amp; efficient, speeding up the whole workflow. Analyzing the user's will to pay the application closes every deal much faster than traditional methods.Â&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Compass</strong></h2>

<p><strong><em>A global mission: to help everyone find their perfect home</em></strong></p>
<div><p>More than 14 000 realtors across 100 US cities are using this application to find and sell houses. Meanwhile, the app story with artificial algorithms is quite curious. The great AI transition happened in 2019 when the company hired 200+ engineers and AI professionals to power up the solution. Now the AI team counts 320+ people in New York, Washington, and Seattle. The AI engine works in several different ways.</p><p>First, it offers personalized recommendations to every user based on its previous searches and interests. Second, a CRM-integrated AI shows realtors once a customer was particularly active on their platform, or other house search websites. Thus, it keeps realtors informed about customer behavior.</p></div>
<p><em>â€œ The process of buying or selling a home is often thought of as daunting and difficult, and Compass is changing that, Robert Reffkin, CEO at Compass</em></p>
<h2><strong>5. Localize.city</strong></h2>

    </figure>


                    
    
<div><p>A common thing people expect about a future apartment is sufficient sunlight in each room. However, the only way to check it is by visiting a place, isnâ€™t it? Localize.city proves to be an excellent alternative method by analyzing how much light each apartment receives during the year. More so, it analyses the sunniest hours during the day and the amount of time when sunlight penetrates the room.</p><p>The startup created a list of 10 darkest buildings in each district. Sunlight also affects the price of the apartment, as homeowners value natural light incredibly high. Therefore, once a user indicates their preferences, they get the info about park proximity, broken items, and even previous tenant complaints. We believe it is a sound example of how to use AI in commercial real estate to get unique data.</p></div>
<h2><strong>6. Rex</strong></h2>


                </div>

<div><p><strong><em>Mission: take the stress and confusion out of buying and selling houses</em></strong></p><p>Unlike many real estate agencies, this one does not use MLS (Multiple Property Listings). And it charges only 2% from realtors and homebuyers instead of typical 5 or 6%. Moreover, it pays the agent salaries, instead of working with them as contractors.Â&nbsp;</p></div>
<p><em>So how does it use AI?<br></em><strong><br></strong>To replace agents. The company tracks users who clicked the ads and their behavior on the website. Then, it shows the ads according to their interests. Smart algorithms also analyze the data about homeowner history to find out their buying capabilities. Computers are better at processing big loads of data, but REX still hires 22 people to guide users through the sales process. <strong><br></strong></p>
<h2><strong>7. Redfin</strong></h2>

    </figure>


                    
    
<div><p>Unlike the previous one, this tool uses AI in real estate to help realtors in their jobs, not replace them. It simplifies customer search and requires only a 1% commission for each sale. Artificial intelligence Matchmaking Tool analyzes data to recommend a home to potential buyers. Users are 4 times more likely to click on RedFin recommendation than on the one fitting their own saved search.</p><p>Besides, the company also uses AI to calculate the house value and advise home sellers on their marketing.</p></div>
<h2><strong>8. Apartment Ocean</strong></h2>
<div><p>Apartment Ocean helps realtors to convert potential customers and cut on acquisition expenses. It is the artificial intelligence chatbot that serves as a communication tool on a website. </p><p>The problem with first-time contacts is that most of them do not turn to sales. However, thanks to this convenient application, you can generate instant replies without spending effort &amp; time on this. The AI real estate application answers even the trickiest questions, sounding like a human. Besides, it is easy to customize and install on your website, a perfect solution for busy realtors.</p></div>

    </figure>


                    
    
<div><p>One of the logical applications of AI in real estate is price estimation. HouseCanary does just that, evaluating the house price at the current moment and in the nearest future. The AI software program analyses data during the past 40 years and generates forecasts with a 2.5 margin error, which is dramatically low. </p><p>Thanks to this data, you can anticipate the upcoming peaks or valleys, and allow for wise buying decisions. Lending organizations, financial, and real estate agencies use this software to build trust with their customers and convert them.</p><p>HouseCanary's success story proves that cost estimations &amp; predictive analytics are in high demand in the real estate market. It received $64 million of funding in total.</p></div>


                    
    
<h2><strong>10. GeoPhy</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img src="https://www.byteant.com/media/rj2lhlw2/geophy_ai.png?width=730&amp;height=456&amp;mode=max" alt="AI real estate app GeoPhy" width="730" height="456" data-udi="umb://media/aea3798c0adc43ceae00c616c2dd5498"></strong></p>

<p>A few days ago I finished a CAD application whose purpose is to calculate the energy efficiency of Dwellings (or multiple Dwellings). It can be seen as an application similar to Autocad (which is used in Civil Engineering, Architecture, etc) but with the specific purpose to do energy efficiency assessment.</p>



<p>After about 1 year of development, me and my client (he himself an energy rater) were able to finish the project within a much smaller time frame and a much smaller budget than other similar projects from competing companies. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that its cost was about 30 times less and it took at least less than half the time.</p>



<p>The feedback and reception to our application has gone much beyond what we expected even though the application is still in Beta.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>My responsibility in this project was to define the higher level architecture, do the implementation, User Interface Design and User Experience and all the aspects of setting up a professional environment and workflow for developing a software application.</p>



<p>My client, Nick, an energy rater by profession, has always been pushing energy rating to a higher level. He’s done the energy ratings for several buildings including commercial, public and residential. Some of them award winning projects. As a self-taught, amateur programmer he also helped implement the application. </p>



<p>The purpose of the tool, called HERO, is to do the energy efficiency assessment of buildings and in the end generate an energy rating certificate. These certificates are mandatory and every building must meet a minimum value of energy efficiency. Applications that have this purpose must be certified by a public entity (ours already is) and the professional doing the energy rating must himself be a certified energy rater (having completed an accredited course with success).</p>

<p>If you follow my blog, you’ve probably noticed from the picture that the application is using <a href="https://www.pixelduke.com/java-javafx-theme-jmetro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JMetro</a>. </p>



<p>The picture above is from the Model view. In this view you create the project and enter all its data. The pane to the left is where you can view  the visuals, and create the floor plan (visually). The pane to the right is the Datagrid where you see and enter data for all the objects of the project (walls, windows, floors, top lights, etc) in a table like format. All these views are inside a Dockpane like container that allows you to resize, restore and maximize each pane. </p>



<p>There are also other views, inside the Model view, not shown in the picture. Like the library where you can create and manage the materials that you can use throughout your project, your custom assemblies for walls, the different types of windows, etc.. </p>

<figcaption>Results View</figcaption>

<p>After you run the simulation, you can also see the results of your energy efficiency modelling (picture above). The Results View shows a dashboard, with charts, tables, etc, that lets the user view at a glance how efficient the dwelling or dwellings are and quickly notice what might need to be readjusted.</p>



<h2>Details and a few features</h2>



<p>The calculations for the energy rating can get really complex. They can depend on a multitude of factors. To name a few:</p>



<ol><li>The materials used. There’s a huge database of materials that can be used in Floors, Ceilings, Walls, etc. And the user can also, for instance, create his own custom assembly for Walls defining their list of materials in a specified order (from inside to the outside).</li><li>Size and layout of the building’s areas.</li><li>Climate over the year in the area where the building is located.</li><li>Orientation of the building (influences how the Sun heats up each area).</li><li>Shading of other buildings, fences, etc that are around the building;</li><li>The building’s penetrations.</li><li>Top lights used, ceiling fans, exhaust fans, etc.</li><li>Other factors.</li></ol>



<p>All the items mentioned are modeled and calculated in HERO.</p>



<p>All the geometry, intersections, etc are also computed by the application. For instance, if you create a Zone in a level – a Zone can be a living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc – and then another smaller Zone in the level above, there will be an intersection. This intersection will produce a “hole” in the ceiling of the level below, like a donut.  Hero will realize automatically that the 2 zones are connected and will create a new Ceiling in the zone below (in the place of the donut) adjacent to the zone above.</p>

<p>Another thing that HERO automatically computes are adjacencies between Walls and Zones. If you create a Zone right next to another, instead of creating 2 Walls between the Zones, the application will automatically figure out that the Zones are connected. It will connect the 2 zones by creating 1 internal Wall between them, which is different from an outside facing Wall.</p>

<p>For this post not to get too long, too tedious, and too technical I just pointed out some of the features of Hero, there are a lot more. I think you can get a general idea of Hero’s features from what was mentioned above. </p>



<h3>Reception and feedback</h3>



<p>Me and my client were surprised with the reception the application is getting. Given the application is still in Beta and that there are already 3 applications in the market, 2 of them well established, we were expecting a much more moderate reaction.</p>



<p>Before 24 hours had passed since the release, we had already 50 registered users and 1 certificate issued. In our issue tracker, which has the purpose of only storing bug reports from our users, we were getting thanks messages.</p>

<h3>Technology and form factor</h3>



<p><em><span>Notice: I might be a bit biased because I’ve been working with JavaFX (and Java) since the very first release. However, I’m going to be as impartial as possible.</span></em></p>



<p>If the requirements are to build a productivity application, the best option in my opinion is to go desktop native, instead of, for instance, doing a mobile app. Nothing beats a keyboard and a mouse in this area. Besides more precise and faster input, you can display much more content on screen without having to worry about the touch targets being too small for the fingers. This also means the user will be able to see more data on screen which will be important in a productivity application. </p>



<p>As for “native” vs web. Native allows for better performance, security, etc than a web application. Web has the advantage of higher availability (no required installations, all the user needs is a browser) but if you’re building a performance demanding app, I think your best bet is to go native.</p>



<p>Regarding the programming model, I tend to prefer Java (or any other object orientated, type safe language) and its framework and big collection of third party libraries than the web programming model. Especially when building complex applications.</p>



<p>JavaFX (and Java) are a perfect fit in this type of scenario as JavaFX really shines in the Desktop world. HERO is currently running on Windows, which will probably be the majority of users for your desktop applications. But we can easily, with a few tweaks, support Mac as well and even Linux (though in our case there probably won’t be many users using that O.S., if any).</p>



<p>If, for some reason, we ever have a need to create a scaled-down mobile or tablet version or reuse some of our existing components in a mobile application, we can. Oracle and Gluon have been pushing hard for this, continuously working and making it better. Recently, by leveraging GraalVM, applications can be AOT compiled, benefiting from faster startup times and performance. This is also great for IOS, since IOS doesn’t allow for JIT compilation. </p>



<p>To be fair and to try to be impartial, I’ll conclude this section with what, in my view, are some of downsides of JavaFX (currently):</p>



<ul><li>Table API.</li><li>Lack of tools to better debug CSS issues and try out CSS tweaks, like for instance having something like firebug (ScenicView is great for other purposes but not specifically for this one).</li><li>Lack of support for some of the Web’s CSS properties. Also one of my pet peeves is the fact that every property is prefixed with “-fx-” (I would prefer this would be dropped on properties that have the same behavior as the ones in Web CSS).</li><li>IDE support for JavaFX CSS isn’t great: error highlighting, etc (side note: I’m using Intellij).</li><li>JavaFX API is too closed and lacks better support for extension on some cases (classes that are final, classes with final methods, etc) regarding this issue I preferred Swing’s more open API.</li><li>Some Font rendering issues (this might only happen with some fonts and only on some platforms – Windows is worse than Mac).</li><li>Better separation of concerns in JavaFX Controls. There was a plan a few years ago to make Behavior classes public, which would probably provide a better separation between the View, Controller and Model aspects of a Control. Right now it’s a bit difficult to create a new Skin for an existing JavaFX SDK Control if your only requirement is to tweak some of its View aspects and when that can’t be done through CSS. This often results in developers preferring to create a new Control altogether than providing a new Skin for an existing one which will mean more work and a higher degree of coupling with those Controls (for instance, you won’t be able to easily switch between Skins). The fact that the API is often too closed also means that, usually, extending an existing Control isn’t an option.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Despite being a quite complex application, I believe HERO was created in a record time. Not …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>When we first</strong> <strong>conceived of Density six years ago</strong>, we just wanted to know if there was a line at our favorite coffee shop. We thought it was odd there was an API for inclement weather but there wasn't an API for how many people were in a space. We reasoned, if a solution didn't already exist â€” which surely it must â€” it shouldn't be more than a weekend project. How hard could it be to count people?</p>



<p>We were optimistic and wrong by about three years. As we tried to solve our own problem, we learned two important lessons. First, people are weird. They do things you wouldn't expect â€” they bump into each other, take phone calls, and they bring a lot of stuff with them: bags and boxes, bicycles and baskets, tv's and trash cans, chairs, carts, iPads, lunch, even other people sometimes. This makes counting them unfathomably complex. You can't fault commodity products for being bad at the analysis. People are just really weird.</p>



<p>Second, we learned we weren't alone. We met hundreds and now thousands of others trying to answer the same question â€” how many people used my office, bank, lounge, desk, space, floor, building, campusâ€¦ city. If only we knew, we could reduce waste and energy use, improve access and productivity, clean the spaces that need it and skip the ones that don't. If only we knew, we could A/B test physical space or even use less concrete! If only we knew how the world was used, we could measure how it works, identify its inefficiencies, and remake it.</p>



<p>Until recently, we had been helping hundreds of companies do just this â€” quantify how buildings were used so they could design them more effectively. Today, things have changed. We've been asked to help those same companies and hundreds more reopen their buildings and businesses safely. We're helping them avoid leases they don't need in order to prioritize payroll. We're working to keep meat processing plants, distribution centers, manufacturers, offices, universities, even an entire village in Ohio open and safe.</p>



<p>The built world was modernizing before the pandemic. It will continue to modernize well after it's over. In the meantime, we're proud to say we're not going anywhere and we're eager to help.</p>

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w"></a></p>
<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" alt="" width="533" height="142" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Digital microwaves show an example of good UI doing what you wanted</h2>

	<p><small>July 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often, you encounter a bit of UI that does what you mean
to do so transparently that you don't even notice that the UI is
breaking its own 'how it works' rules to do so. You could say that
this is the complete reverse of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixAnnoyance">robot logic</a>,
as seen yesterday in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/PamPasswdErrorFail">trying to change your password on Linux</a>. Recently I realized that I'd run
into such a 'do what I mean even though it doesn't fit' UI in plain
ordinary microwaves, of all places.</p>

<p>Your typical microwave has a 0-9 digital pad for entering the cooking
time and its cook time is set in MM:SS. If you want one minute and
twenty seconds, you punch in '1 2 0' and the microwave displays '1:20'
and counts down from there. This is all perfectly logical and sensible,
and forms a clear model of how the microwave behaves.</p>

<p>So what happens if you enter '9 0'? The microwave doesn't reject
this as an error because you can't have 90 seconds in the seconds
portion of a minutes and seconds time (you can have at most 59).
Instead it breaks the model and gives you 90 seconds of cook time.
This creates some inconsistencies, of course; if you enter '9 9'
you get 99 seconds, but if you enter '1 0 0', you get 60 seconds
(because now it's 1:00 cook time). On at least some microwaves
this still works even if you enter more than two digits; '1 9 9'
is 199 seconds, not an error (or one minute plus 99 seconds).</p>

<p>This behavior was so natural and so obviously correct and what I meant
that I spent years not realizing there was anything unusual about
it. Only one day as I was keying in '9 0' yet again and congratulating
myself on pressing one less digit than '1 3 0' did I stop to ask myself
why it even worked. And the answer is that the microwave makers went out
of their way to figure out what this input should mean so that it should
match user expectations, and make it so.</p>

<p>(I suspect or at least hope that there were user studies by some early
microwave company on what people expected to happen when they keyed in
various number sequences that weren't proper MM:SS setups.)</p>

  <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>When running a production Kubernetes cluster, one of the most important (and burdensome) tasks is keeping everything up-to-date. Kubernetes itself cuts quarterly releases, which quickly fall out of support—if you fail to upgrade, you could be left open to security holes and buggy features. Fortunately, the quarterly cadence at least makes these releases predictable: you can even set a reminder to go through the process every three months.</p>

<p><span>Source: <a href="https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/</a></span></p>
<p>But on top of Kubernetes, you probably have half a dozen add-ons running in your cluster, most likely installed&nbsp;<a href="https://helm.sh/"> <span>via Helm</span></a>. Supplementary components like nginx-ingress, cert-manager and linkerd are often critical to running a production-grade cluster. You might even be using k8s-specific deployments for common applications like PostgreSQL or Wordpress. Each of these tools has its own release cadence, and some updates may come with critical security patches.</p>
<p>Installing a new patch typically isn’t that hard - usually it just means rerunning a <span><code>helm install,</code></span>&nbsp;command, or updating a single line in your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/why-infrastructure-as-code-kubernetes"> <span>Infrastructure-as-Code</span></a> repository. But how do you know <em>when</em> it’s time to update? Unlike Kubernetes itself, Helm chart updates are incredibly hard to monitor and predict.</p>
<h2><strong>Observe and Report</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=480&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png" alt="Nova_bfw_color" width="480" srcset="https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=240&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 240w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=480&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 480w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=720&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 720w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=960&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 960w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=1200&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 1200w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=1440&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/FairwindsOps/Nova/"><span>Nova</span></a>, an open source tool by Fairwinds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. <a href="https://ctt.ac/8q0Af" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click to Tweet</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. Nova will let you know if you’re running a chart that’s out-of-date or deprecated, so you can make sure you’re always aware of updates.</p>
<pre><code>Release Name      Installed    Latest     Old     Deprecated
cert-manager      v0.11.0      v0.15.2    true    false
insights-agent    0.21.1       0.21.1     false   false
grafana           2.1.3        3.1.1      true    false
metrics-server    2.8.8        2.11.1     true    false
nginx-ingress     1.25.0       1.40.3     true    false
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to see how far behind you are on any installed Helm charts. In the example above, we’ve got the latest version of <span><code>insights-agent,</code></span>but there are minor updates available for some core infrastructure, including <span><code>cert-manager,</code><code>nginx-ingress,</code></span>and <span><code>metrics-server.</code></span><span><span><code>grafana</code></span></span>also has a new major version available, so we might be missing out on some cool new features!</p>
<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>This turned out to be a harder problem than expected.</p>
<p>The first issue was in supporting both Helm 2 and Helm 3. Helm 2 stored chart metadata using ConfigMaps, which were fairly easy to parse. But Helm 3 uses Secrets, along with some byzantine encoding practices. With some help from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/kubernetes-easily-find-deprecated-api-versions-with-pluto"> <span>the Pluto team</span></a>, we built support for both versions, as well as the ability to auto-detect charts from both versions. You can use this feature by specifying <span><code>--helm-version=auto.</code></span></p>
<p>Even more challenging was matching the installed chart to the upstream source. Unfortunately, Helm doesn’t store info about the upstream repository in the chart metadata, making an exact match impossible. All we have to go on is the name, which might be duplicated across different repositories. For example, many of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/"> <span>the Bitnami charts</span></a> were recently migrated out of the<a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/"> <span>core charts repo</span></a>, but kept the same names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find a match, we have to look in <em>all</em> known repositories for charts with a matching name, then use heuristics like the chart’s <span><code>version, home, description,</code></span> and <span><code>maintainers</code></span> to find a good match. So far this strategy has a 100% success rate, but it feels like a bit of a hack. If you know of a better solution for finding the upstream repository for an installed Helm chart, let us know!</p>
<h2><strong>Putting it into Practice</strong></h2>
<p>Nova saves a lot of time and effort for anyone looking to keep their charts up-to-date. Instead of having to monitor each individual chart for updates, operators can now run a single CLI to detect old versions running in their cluster. But you still have to remember to run the CLI!</p>
<p>When managing hundreds of clusters, the chances of forgetting to run Nova on a particular cluster, misreading the output, or failing to act on the results, are all but certain at scale. Furthermore, some organizations <em>need</em> to be on an older version of a given tool (in particular, <span><code>cert-manager</code></span> has regularly introduced breaking changes). So we needed a way to operationalize Nova at scale.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights"> <span>Fairwinds Insights</span></a>. Insights can run Nova (along with other Kubernetes auditing tools) automatically on a regular schedule—every hour by default—and use the results to create&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/features/action-items/"> <span>Action Items</span></a>. These Action Items serve as a reminder to update your Helm Chart, and can be piped to Slack, Datadog, or anywhere else your engineers live.</p>
<p>Internally, we also maintain a YAML file that includes a set of standards - particular versions of each add-on that we expect our clients to run. We use Nova to make sure that YAML file stays up-to-date with the latest versions, and to keep our Infrastructure-as-Code in line with those standards.</p>

<p>Automatically checking Helm charts for updates solves a big problem for us at Fairwinds, and for the Kubernetes community as a whole. But the ecosystem moves fast, and there are many more pieces of software and infrastructure that we need to stay on top of. Other things we’d like to build automated checks for are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported k8s versions on managed Kubernetes providers (like GKE, EKS, and AKS)</li>
<li>Docker tags (at least where semver tagging practices are used)</li>
<li>Docker base images</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether these checks fit into Nova, or will justify creating a separate project, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any domain, staying on top of the latest releases is a big, scary problem. We hope Nova helps the Kubernetes community keep their clusters reliable and secure.</p>

But as more and more topics become too risky to discuss outside of the prevailing orthodoxies, it makes sense to constantly self-censor, feeling unbound only when part of a denunciatory pack. </p><p>Institutions that are supposed to be guardians of free expression—academia and journalism in particular—are becoming enforcers of conformity. Campuses have bureaucracies that routinely undermine free speech and due process. Now, these practices are breaching the ivy wall. They are coming to a high school or corporate HR office near you.</p><p>The cultural rules around hot button issues are ever-expanding. It’s as if a daily script went out describing what’s acceptable, and those who flub a line—or don’t even know a script exists—are rarely given the benefit of the doubt, no matter how benign their intent. Naturally, people are deciding the best course is to shut up. It makes sense to be part of the silenced majority when the price you pay for an errant tweet or remark can be the end of your livelihood. </p><p>Do these problems really matter so long as we have a president who daily tramples on rights, civil discourse, and the rule of law? They do. Of course, we must keep our focus on the danger this administration presents. But it is also our moral and strategic obligation to vigorously defend the principles of a free society. Upholding these values will help us defeat Trumpism. </p><p>The process by which sinners are punished and apostates expelled can seem random. But there are rules and patterns to the ways in which speech is being silenced. Analyzing and understanding these can help us stand up to the illiberalism of this moment, whether it comes from the left or the right. </p><p>To that end, here is my taxonomy of fear. </p><p><strong>The Perils of Safety </strong></p><p>James Bennet’s resignation from his position as the editorial page editor of the <em>New York Times</em> quickly became the genesis story of today’s debate about “cancel culture.” Bennet was pressured to depart after he ran an op-ed by Tom Cotton, a Republican Senator from Arkansas, whose argument that the military should be used to respond to riots caused an uproar among the paper’s staff.</p><p>At first, A. G. Sulzberger, the paper’s publisher, publicly expressed his support for the decision to run the op-ed. But that quickly changed after Black employees asserted not just that Cotton’s argument was morally repugnant, or that he failed to make it in a way that met the <em>Times</em>’ standards, but that the piece threatened their lives. “Running this puts Black @nytimes staff in danger,” many of them tweeted.</p><p>The language used by the <em>Times </em>staffers is indicative of a wider trend. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>,</em> Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt describe the recent emergence and rapid spread on college campuses of what they call “safetyism,” a view that “equates emotional discomfort with physical danger.” Safetyism, they write, teaches students “to see words as violence and interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous.”</p><p>Confronted with words, ideas, or decisions they dislike, a growing number of people are asserting that they are in danger of suffering psychological or even bodily harm. But when one party asserts that a debate threatens their very well-being, it is hard to deliberate on policy—or topics such as race and gender. The result is a narrowing of the space for public discussion and an inability to teach ever more ideas and books. </p><p>As Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen has chronicled in the <em>New Yorker</em>, for example, law professors find it increasingly difficult to teach rape law because some students consider the subject too disturbing. “Student organizations representing women’s interests now routinely advise students that they should not feel pressured to attend or participate in class sessions that focus on the law of sexual violence, and which might therefore be traumatic,” she writes. “Some students have even suggested that rape law should not be taught because of its potential to cause distress.” </p><p>But, as Suk Gersen has pointed out, it was feminists who fought for the overhaul of deeply sexist rape laws, and it is sexual assault victims who will be hurt if lawyers do not learn about the subject. In practice, safetyism will make some of the most vulnerable people in our society less safe.</p><p><strong>Contamination by Association</strong></p><p>Recently, more than 150 writers and academics (including Yascha Mounk and I) signed a public letter defending open debate. Shortly after, transgender writer Emily VanDerWerff shared on Twitter a note of <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyvdw/status/1280580388495097856">complaint</a> she had written to her editors, stating that the letter had rendered her “less safe at <em>Vox</em>” because Matt Yglesias, one of <em>Vox’s</em> co-founders, was among its signatories.</p><p>How could signing a letter decrying the intolerant atmosphere on the left render a colleague less safe? Because, VanDerWerff argues, the letter was also signed by people she characterized as “prominent anti-trans voices.” Though the letter itself made no mention of trans issues, and VanDerWerff has never accused Yglesias himself of expressing objectionable views on the subject, this, she claims, was enough to harm her.</p><p>VanDerWerff’s note certainly illustrates safetyism. Going one step further, it also assumes the truth of a principle of “contamination by association.” People, the logic goes, cannot only be made unsafe by the beliefs or statements of their colleagues but also by those with whom their colleagues associate. </p><p>In this view, the contamination is ruthless and insidious. As VanDerWerff asserts, not only is Yglesias now responsible for the views of all the signers of the letter; she is also concerned that readers and sources may now assume that <em>she herself </em>shares those views because she works with Yglesias. If the principle of “contamination by association” were to be adopted this broadly, people would soon be answerable for the work of the co-signatories on a letter, for those with whom they have appeared on a panel, for those they might talk to on a podcast, and for countless others with whom they share the most tenuous of professional connections. </p><p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/shadi-hamid/">Shadi Hamid</a> is a Muslim scholar of Islamist movements; to do his work, he needs to talk to people who hold ideas many find objectionable. His willingness to engage with people he disagrees with often makes him the subject of fierce criticism about whom he “associates” with. He lucidly explains why the adoption of the idea that he shares responsibility for the views of others is so detrimental: “My policy is to speak with pretty much anyone—Islamists, Christian theocrats, Trumpists, Salafis—as long as I can say what I think on something that’s important to me.” </p><p>Even for Hamid, there are some red lines: He will not appear alongside white supremacists or those representing designated terror groups. But he insists that it is important to draw those lines as widely as possible: “If we said we couldn’t do research or couldn’t interview people who had bad views—how would we study things?” Hamid asked me. “It’s a very limited way of looking at the world, one that’s dangerous for democracy.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hamid is right. If we accept the logic of contamination by association, this requirement will quickly come to suppress the exchange of ideas—or even exposure to ideas which we need to interrogate precisely because we hate them. Tackling views we disagree with is a basic obligation of journalism, especially when they are held by people with the power to put them into effect.</p><p>David Remnick, the editor of the<em> New Yorker</em>, gave eloquent voice to the necessity of such interrogation when he explained why he wanted to interview former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon at the <em>New Yorker</em> festival in 2018. Remnick acknowledged the point of view of those who assert that it is better not to give a platform to someone with illiberal views. “But to interview Bannon is not to endorse him,” Remnick wrote. “The point of an interview, a rigorous interview, particularly in a case like this, is to put pressure on the views of the person being questioned.” </p><p>But Remnick was not able to put this pressure on Bannon because the pressure on Remnick to rescind Bannon’s invitation was so great that he canceled the interview. </p><p>To accept the principles of contamination by association would also have another, perhaps even more serious cost: It would make it much more difficult to build a community across ideological divides—or within one’s own ideological group. Today, people are held to account for everything they have said or written, no matter how long ago, and no matter how much their minds may have changed. But under the rules of contamination, any affiliation with anyone else means everything <em>they </em>have said and done is your responsibility, too. Under such circumstances, any rational person is going to think of everyone else, first and foremost, as a potential human landmine; better, then, to draw the circle of one’s friends, colleagues, and collaborators as narrowly as possible.</p><p><strong>Intent Is Irrelevant</strong></p><p>Last month, Libby Schaaf, the white mayor of Oakland, California, announced that ropes had been found hanging from trees around a local lake. “These incidents will be investigated as a hate crime,” she said at a press conference. “I want to be clear, regardless of the intentions of whoever put those nooses in our public trees, in our sacred public space here in Oakland, intentions don’t matter.”</p><p>An investigation revealed that the five ropes had nothing to do with lynching: They were homemade exercise equipment, used by adults and children, put up months earlier by a black resident, Victor Sengbe. He explained his intent at a press conference: “It was really a fun addition to the park.” </p><p>But this happy conclusion was of no interest to Schaaf. The actual purpose of the ropes did not “remove nor excuse their …</p></div></div>

			<p>Global variables are almost universally discouraged in software development — and for good reason. Storing data in a context is often discouraged as well — and again for good reason. However, global variables and context values can be combined to produce something that preserves the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of each.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-global-variables">The Problem With Global Variables</h2>
<p>One of the earliest rules a software developer learns is to avoid global variables. But global values do exist. Most applications have at least several variables that could be considered globals such as a database connection pool, a logger, or an application configuration object. Technically, they may or may not actually be global variables. The developer may scrupulously follow “best practices” and instead pass the value as an argument or capture it in a closure. But practically speaking, they are global values. There is only one application configuration object.</p>
<p>The big problem with a global variable is the “variable” not the “global”. The downside of a global immutable value is small. But usually values like an application configuration object are initialized on program startup and do not change afterwards.</p>
<p>But the “global” part can cause problems as well. For example, when the actual application is running it makes sense for there to be one global configuration object. But global variables make it much more difficult to write tests. Another example would be a logger that is used almost everywhere, but on occasion should be overridden.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-context-values">The Problem With Context Values</h2>
<p>Context values have multiple issues as well. Type safety is lost because they are stored and retrieved as <code>interface{}</code>. In addition, functions that rely on context values being present essentially have hidden required arguments. Lastly, there is a performance penalty for a context with many values.</p>
<h2 id="the-context-overridable-global-pattern">The Context Overridable Global Pattern</h2>
<p>The context overridable global pattern restricts access to globals to getter functions. These functions accept a context as an argument. If the context has a value for that global then the context value is returned. If not the global is returned. For example, the sample below has an context overridable global of <code>AppName</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"context"</span>
	<span>"ctxglobexample/app"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	app.<span>SetAppName</span>(<span>"Global Value"</span>)

	<span>// The background context will use the global value.
</span><span></span>	fmt.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Background context:"</span>, app.<span>AppName</span>(context.<span>Background</span>()))

	<span>// A context can override the global value.
</span><span></span>	ctx <span>:=</span> app.<span>WithAppName</span>(context.<span>Background</span>(), <span>"Context Value"</span>)
	fmt.<span>Println</span>(<span>"WithAppName context:"</span>, app.<span>AppName</span>(ctx))

	<span>// The global value is unchanged.
</span><span></span>	fmt.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Background context:"</span>, app.<span>AppName</span>(context.<span>Background</span>()))
}
</code></pre></div><p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">Background context: Global Value
WithAppName context: Context Value
Background context: Global Value
</code></pre></div><p>And here is the implementation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> app

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"context"</span>
)

<span>// Use internal types and values as context keys to enforce access only through exposed functions.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> ctxKey <span>int</span>

<span>const</span> (
	_ ctxKey = <span>iota</span>
	appNameCtxKey
)

<span>var</span> appName <span>string</span>

<span>func</span> <span>SetAppName</span>(s <span>string</span>) {
	<span>if</span> appName <span>!=</span> <span>""</span> {
		<span>panic</span>(<span>"cannot call appName twice"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> s <span>==</span> <span>""</span> {
		<span>panic</span>(<span>"AppName must not be empty"</span>)
	}
	appName = s
}

<span>func</span> <span>AppName</span>(ctx context.Context) <span>string</span> {
	v <span>:=</span> ctx.<span>Value</span>(appNameCtxKey)
	<span>if</span> v <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> v.(<span>string</span>)
	}

	<span>if</span> appName <span>==</span> <span>""</span> {
		<span>panic</span>(<span>"missing AppName in ctx and global"</span>)
	}

	<span>return</span> appName
}

<span>func</span> <span>WithAppName</span>(ctx context.Context, s <span>string</span>) context.Context {
	<span>return</span> context.<span>WithValue</span>(ctx, appNameCtxKey, s)
}
</code></pre></div><p>This pattern solves the problems identified above with globals and contexts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global variables are mutable — global values can only be set once. If mutability was <em>really</em> desired, then the getter and setter functions can be safely altered to use a mutex.</li>
<li>Global variables are global — the context can be used to override the global whenever needed.</li>
<li>Context values lose type safety — access is restricted to getter and setter functions that are type safe.</li>
<li>Functions relying on context values have hidden required arguments — the global value is used if the context value is missing. The required argument is now an optional argument.</li>
<li>Performance penalty of many values on a context — the <em>almost</em> global values are rarely set on the context. They fall through to the global without ever using <code>context.WithValue()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron" id="" title="">GitHub repo</a>) is a note-taking tool based on <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011401.html" id="" title="">Zettelkasten</a>, that aims to be <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html" id="" title="">future-proof</a>. Version <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/releases/tag/0.6.0.0" id="" title="">0.6</a> just got released; its major highlight is that neuron is now based on the <strong>Pandoc</strong> AST. This allows us to support any format supported by <a href="https://pandoc.org/" id="" title="">Pandoc</a>. Experimental <strong>org-mode</strong> support is <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/313" id="" title="">already in</a>, to begin with.</p><h2 id="better-markdown">Better Markdown</h2><p>Previous versions of neuron used the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmark" id="" title="">mmark</a> parser which advertises itself as being “strict”. This prevented certain links from working as they caused the parser to fail. In version 0.6, I switched over to use <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs" id="" title="">commonmark-hs</a>, which is the Haskell implementation of the <a href="https://commonmark.org/" id="" title=""><strong>CommonMark</strong> specification</a>, written by the same author of Pandoc. Another reason for switching is that commonmark-hs and its extensions can be compiled to JavaScript via GHCJS<sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup>, which is useful when reusing the Haskell code with the web app (see below).</p><p>The commonmark-hs parser includes <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/tree/master/commonmark-extensions" id="" title="">a bunch of nifty <strong>extensions</strong></a> that are all made available in neuron.</p><p>In addition, you can style your Markdown notes using supported Semantic UI classes (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/176" id="" title="">see here</a>), as well as use raw HTML if necessary.</p><h2 id="uplink-tree">Uplink Tree</h2><p>I find arbitrary graph views of Zettelkasten software to be rarely useful. Neuron on the other hand displays what is known as a “<a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/5e41fd32.html" id="" title="">uplink tree</a>” in each note view, which represents the <em>subset</em> (inasmuch as “uplink” is a type of “backlink”) of the backlink graph for that note. In Zettelkasten-speak, we talk of a note “branching” to another. The uplink tree displays all notes “branching” to the note being viewed.</p><p>Uplink Trees are similar to navigation panel or category tree, except that the heterarchy is built organically over time based on how the notes are linked (see <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2017401.html" id="" title="">Folgezettel Heterarchy</a>). In the screenshot below, you are viewing the uplink tree of the note titled “<span><span data-inverted="" data-position="right center" data-tooltip="Tags: nix; reflex/obelisk"><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2017101.html">Type safe static assets</a></span></span>”. Notice how this note has multiple parents (that “branch of” to that note). See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011504.html" id="" title="">Linking</a> in the neuron manual.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/uplinktree.png" title=""></p><h2 id="vim">Vim</h2><p>In addition to <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/4a6b25f1.html" id="" title="">Emacs</a>, there is now a Vim extension for neuron. See <a href="https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim" id="" title="">neuron.vim</a> by ihsan. Just like the Emacs extension, it supports “virtual titles” in neovim, where the title of a linked note is displayed next to the link ID, as you can see from the screenshot below.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/neuronvim.png" title=""></p><h2 id="improved-cli-query">Improved CLI query</h2><p>The <code id="">neuron query</code> command can be used to query your Zettelkasten and get JSON output. <code id="">neuron query --id &lt;ID&gt;</code> gets you the metadata of a zettel note, whereas <code id="">neuron query --graph</code> gets the entire graph. For an example of what you can do with the later, check out <a href="https://github.com/b0o/neuron-extras" id="" title="">neuron-autoindex</a> by Maddison Hellstrom.</p><h2 id="error-reporting">Error reporting</h2><p>Neuron 0.6 includes resilient error handling. If there is an error in your notes, the command line tool will report them both in the console and the web interface, without breaking its workflow. This enables you to leave the daemon (<code id="">neuron rib -ws ..</code>) running on your server, as all errors are now reported on the generated site.</p><h2 id="docker-images">Docker images</h2><p>While Nix is still the recommended way to install, we now also have auto-created Docker images for neuron. With one <code id="">docker run ...</code> command, you can run the latest development version of <code id="">neuron</code> in a matter of seconds. The whole image is only about 100MB in size. See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/c6176636.html" id="" title="">Docker workflow</a> for details.</p><h2 id="automatic-publishing">Automatic Publishing</h2><p>You can now set up your neuron notes to publish <em>automatically</em> on the web for free. See <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron-template#readme" id="" title="">neuron-template</a> to get started. The gist of the idea is that we use GitHub Actions and Pages to update your published site as you change your notes in the Git repository. I publish every neuron site in this way. A <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/778816d3.html" id="" title="">GitLab workflow</a> also exists.</p><p>You can also of course alternatively choose to self-host your neuron site, say as a systemd service. See the <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6479cd5e.html" id="" title="">documentation on this</a>.</p><h2 id="web--mobile-app">Web &amp; mobile app</h2><p><a href="http://www.cerveau.app/" id="" title="">Cerveau</a> (in private beta) is the web application on top of neuron that integrates with GitHub. The idea is that you can have your cake and eat it too. A command-line based workflow to edit your notes in Git repo does not mean you can’t do the same in a web application or a mobile app. Cerveau aims to address this gap, with the motto being: future-proof notes with little to no compromise on delightful user experience.</p></div></div>]]>

<article>
<div>

<p><em>Time-Driven Development is a software development concept where the main focus is development time. Here's everything you should know about this approach and how you can make it work for your team. </em></p>


<p>Being a <a href="https://adevait.com/software" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">software engineer</a> nowadays can be overwhelming: you need to keep up with the latest trends in software development, always follow “the best” software design practices, and make sure you earn the respect of your Twitter fellows.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A couple of years ago, Johannes Broadwall, fed up with the attitude everyone (including himself) had towards Clean Code, he went so far as to boycott clean code for the sake of compassionate code. </p>


<p>As he said, he was fed up with leaving the office later than his colleagues every day, to spend time “polishing some piece of ultimately meaningless code”.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On a similar note, a Stackoverflow user, who was desperately trying to make use of the <a href="https://adevait.com/software/solid-design-principles-the-guide-to-becoming-better-developers" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOLID design principles</a>, fragmented their code so much that they ended up asking for a way to refactor away from SRP.</p>


<p>When the best practice makes your life as a developer miserable instead of better, it’s not the best practice anymore, is it?</p>


<p>We desperately need a new way of defining the best practices in software development depending on the context of the project. That’s what Time-Driven Development is about: designing our code in a way that saves most time in the long run.</p>





<h2 id="what-is-time-driven-development">What is Time-Driven Development?</h2>


<p>Time-Driven Development is a slightly different software development concept where the main focus is development time. And this doesn’t mean that you should ship features fast without thinking about code quality. </p>


<p>Quite the opposite: before deciding on the design of your code you should think about how it should look like in the long run. </p>


<p>If it’s a feature that should be there years from now and needs to be extendable and maintainable, then go ahead and plan your code architecture in a way where you’ll spend more time now in order to save more going forward.</p>


<p>However, if you’re <a href="https://adevait.com/blog/startups/build-minimum-viable-product" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">building an MVP</a> or a single feature that’s not interconnected and you’re not sure how it will get developed going forward - spending time on the perfect architecture is a time that you could spend on creating more value for the user.</p>


<p>Let’s look at some examples.</p>


<h2 id="how-to-save-time-by-following-good-design-practices"><strong>How to Save Time by Following Good Design Practices?</strong></h2>


<p>Before we became a fully remote network of engineers and designers from all over the world, Adeva was a small agency with a team of 10. </p>


<p>When we first started working remotely and expanding to new countries, it was getting harder to manage things in the way we were used to. </p>


<p>So, we started working on building an infrastructure that will enable us to manage our global team and easily give companies access to the best talent everywhere.</p>


<p>We didn’t want to spend too much time or money initially on building this platform, so we took things lean. We were using Zoho CRM at the time, so we said ok, this will be the base for our platform. </p>


<p>Zoho’s infrastructure was our storage for all candidates' details and we created a nice interface on our side where people could log in and manage their profiles. </p>


<p>We heavily relied on Zoho’s API and looking to do things fast, we created a single class where we dumped all methods we needed to manipulate with Zoho’s data and pass them to our app. It looked something like this:</p>


<pre><code>class ZohoCandidate {
    public function getCandidates() {...}
    public function getCandidate(int $id) {...}
    ...
    public function getExperiences(int $candidateId) {...}
    ...
    public function getEducations(int $candidateId) {...}
    ...
}</code></pre>


<p>Then, in the CandidateController we simply get all details from the CRM class and we’re good to go.</p>


<pre><code>$zohoCandidate = new ZohoCandidate(env('ZOHO_AUTH_TOKEN'));
$candidate = $zohoCandidate-&gt;getCandidate($id);
$candidate = $zohoCandidate-&gt;getCandidate($id);
$educations = $zohoCandidate-&gt;getEducations($id);
$skills = explode(', ', $candidate['Main Skill']);
return view('profile', compact('candidate', 'experiences', 'educations', 'skills'));</code></pre>


<p>This all works fine, but it relies very heavily on the CRM, which can be a problem if you plan to move to your own database storage at one point and stop using the external CRM, like we did. If we follow the SOLID design principles, we’ll notice a few red flags:</p>


<ol><li><strong>The controller knows too much about the implementation of the CRM storage</strong>. It instantiates the class directly and uses its methods, which makes it hard to change the implementation in the future. If we need to change the storage to MySQL for instance, we’ll need to come back to this method and change the whole implementation. This makes the controller open for modification and very error-prone.</li><li><strong>Our app fully relies on the CRM’s storage and variable names, which makes it hard to change the implementation with local storage with different naming conventions</strong>. When we want to change the storage, we’ll need to go ahead and change the variable names throughout the code.</li></ol>


<p>Taking a diff view from Github, this is how changing the storage looked like:</p>


<figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-1024x343.png" alt="Git diff: not following SOLID design principles"></figure>


<p>And this would’ve been ok if it was just one file, but the same issue translates to all other methods for managing the candidates; all controllers handling related data, views, and unit tests. Changing the storage from the external CRM to a local database turned out to be quite a quest. Here are the things we had to do:</p>


<ol><li>Create classes for managing the local database storage (in our case, we’re using <a href="https://adevait.com/laravel" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laravel</a> so this meant creating Eloquent models to use with MySQL).</li><li>Change all dependencies from CRM class to Eloquent in all controllers throughout the app.&nbsp;</li><li>Use Eloquent instead of CRM to pull the data for presenting it to the users.</li><li>Switch all variables to the new naming convention defined by our local connection.&nbsp;</li><li>Change the way we access data in the views (use eloquent relationships and new naming conventions).</li><li>Adjust the unit tests to work accordingly.</li></ol>


<p>Considering all of this, the time we estimated we’ll need to switch the storage was 30 days. The question is: can we do something to <strong>save time</strong>? Turns out, we can. If we improve the code design to allow for extending and changing the implementation easily.</p>


<h3><strong>How to Design Your Code to Help You Save Time in the Long Run?</strong></h3>


<p>Designing your code in a way that will save you significant development time in the long run requires you to invest some extra time in the beginning to create a solid architecture that allows for easy extension and maintenance of your code. Here are some steps that we took which can help you achieve that.</p>


<h4>Don’t Depend on Concrete Implementations</h4>


<p>One of the ground rules of the SOLID design principles is to never depend on concrete implementations and depend on abstractions instead. This gives you the flexibility to change the implementation in the future without having to change the whole code. </p>


<p>In our example below, what we need to do to achieve this is to create an abstract class or an interface that will outline all methods we need to use from the CRM and have our CRM class adhere to that. Our controller would then depend on the abstract class instead of the concrete CRM implementation. </p>


<p>Here is how that looks like:</p>


<pre><code>public function edit($id, CandidateRepositoryInterface $candidateRepository) {
    $candidate = $candidateRepository-&gt;getCandidateById($id);
    $skills = explode(', ', $candidate-&gt;overview-&gt;main_skill);
    return view('profile', compact('candidate', 'skills'));
}</code></pre>


<h4>Be Mindful About What Your Program Expects</h4>


<p>To be able to replace one implementation in our codebase with another, it’s important to be aware of what our program expects. </p>


<p>In our case, we relied on the CRM’s methods and naming conventions so simply replacing the implementation with local storage would’ve broken our program immediately. </p>


<p>To avoid this, it’s a good idea to think about what your methods or variables should look like before starting the implementation. </p>


<p>That way you can easily change the implementation afterward without having to change all instances throughout the code. Let’s see what this means in our example.</p>


<p>First, we had to think about the way we’ll want to access the data when we change the storage to a local database. Since we were going to rely on Laravel’s models, we decided to create an adapter class to mock their behavior. </p>


<p>Now, instead of having one big CRM class, we had small classes for all of the data records the CRM returned, simulating the functionality of the Laravel models.</p>


<pre><code>class Candidate {
    ...
    public function overview() {...}
    public function education() {...}
    public function experience() {...}
}</code></pre>


<p>Then, we need to account for the variable names. So, the adapter class should adapt the variables the CRM returns into the format we need. With this, we can use the API in the same format we’ll need when we change to local storage.</p>


<pre><code>private function parse() {
    return [
        'CANDIDATEID' =&gt; 'id',
        'First Name' =&gt; 'first_name',
        'Last Name' =&gt; 'last_name',
        'Salutation' =&gt; 'salutation',
        'Email' =&gt; 'email',
    ];
}</code></pre>


<h4>Add New Code Instead of Changing the Existing One</h4>


<p>Having adjusted our code like this, we can now change the storage from the CRM to our local database without having to change all of the underlying code. </p>


<p>Instead what we need to do is add new classes that will cover the MySQL implementation and change the dependency from ZohoCrm to MySQL. Here is what we did to achieve this:</p>


<ol><li>Create a new repository <code>LocalCandidateRepository</code> that implements the interface we outlined for the Candidate methods.</li><li>Create new classes for each of the local tables we’ll use in the database once we move to our local storage.</li><li>Bind the&nbsp; LocalCandidateRepository with the CandidateRepositoryInterface, so every time we try to make an instance of CandidateRepositoryInterface it now uses the local repository instead of the CRM. In Laravel, this is done in the AppServiceProvider, with the following …</li></ol></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not too long ago, a friend and new contributor to a large codebase I work with was surprised to learn that an automatic linter rule will block the merge of any pull request containing the string FIXME. “This rule is ill-considered”, he cried out, exasperated.</p>
<p>Judging from his reaction, I didn’t do a good job of explaining the rationale behind our rule. Our use of FIXMEs is unorthodox, but we decided to adopt it for a reason. In fact, in my opinion treating FIXMEs as merge blockers is among the most effective techniques for reducing cognitive overload. In this post, I will explain how FIXMEs unclutter the mind. My goal is to show that automatically enforced FIXMEs are an effective tool for teams working on hard problems.</p>

<p>Code comments are as old as programming itself. Codetags are also not a recent innovation. In the 1980s, programmers started attaching special significance to short tags like FIXME or TODO.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Tags were added as a heads-up that the author wasn’t entirely satisfied with a solution, both as a <em>note to self</em> and for the benefit of other readers. The use of uppercase letters not only made tags stand out visually, it also makes it easy to grep for them.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Codetags are in wide use today, though semantics vary from team to team. While often initially vague, over time more specific meanings tend to materialize, much like emojis in Slack communities gradually acquire a more definite meaning. In my team, a clear line separates FIXMEs from TODOs. The distinction between the two is not universal - it’s an arbitrary convention, but a very useful one. A TODO annotation means that the code in question could be optimized or cleaned up. Crucially, however, delaying the suggested improvement is acceptable, perhaps even preferable from a project-management perspective. A TODO is a gentle nudge. FIXMEs, on the other hand, signal that the code isn’t ready to merge until the author addresses the problem. Our automated linter adds reality to this stringent judgment: FIXMEs fail the CI build, while TODOs are given a pass.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Tags with an agreed-upon meaning aid communication between team members while the pull request is in progress. “FIXME or TODO?” you might ask your colleague while pairing, requesting clarification of the status and priority of a less-than-satisfying solution. Similarly, during code review a FIXME left in the code signals that the line annotated requires close attention. It’s a cry for help: “I’m stuck! Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>While there are valid use cases for TODOs (more on that below), it is FIXMEs that are the more powerful of the two. In particular, FIXMEs have an important role to play before code is ready to review, which is the aspect I will focus on in this post. When encountering a stumbling block — a thought that will lead you away from your path — what you can do is to introduce a FIXME comment:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME: hardcoded user-id

// FIXME: O(n2) time complexity, check if fast enough</code></pre>
<p>Some FIXMEs concern small detours, like retrieving a user-id from inside an existing function. Other issues are more substantial and will require serious thought to resolve. Either way fixing the issue demands mental bandwidth, which is in short supply. While it’s tempting to jump into the FIXME right away, the best choice is often to leave it to one side for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="two-examples-of-using-fixmes">Two examples of using FIXMEs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at two specific maneuvers made possible by FIXMEs. The first, <em>hardcoding</em>, is a form of wishful thinking. When the structure of the code makes it awkward to use a value, a refactoring safari is often needed. The maneuver is to delay this step. Wishful thinking begins with the what-if question. What if we had access to the id here? Well, let’s just pretend that we already do by hardcoding the value. This won’t work except in a very specific case, of course, so it’s not a generic solution — quite the opposite. But hardcoding an absurdly specific solution will allow you to make progress on the design while bracketing insignificant details. The generic solution will come later.</p>
<p><em>Stubbing</em>, the second maneuver, helps when multiple cases need to be considered. You start with a stub, replacing the missing case with an active FIXME:</p>
<pre><code>switch (v) {
   case 1:
   // do something
   break;
   case 2:
   // do something
   break;
   default:
   throw new Error("FIXME: Not implemented");
}</code></pre>
<p>With the partial implementation in place, can now experiment with and get a feel for the code. When you hit the missing case, it will fail loudly and clearly, with an exception and a stacktrace. But the FIXME is not only active at runtime. It will also ensure that you won’t forget to fill in the missing case before finishing your branch.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="juggling-concepts-and-virtual-memory">Juggling concepts and virtual memory</h2>
<p>Pausing a train of thought by converting it into a FIXME improves the flow of deep work, and we can see why by remembering that so many of us struggle to manage our daily priorities. As unfinished work piles up, we develop a nagging doubt in the back of our minds, a fear that there’s something important we’re forgetting, with all the bad consequences that entails. As a solution, David Allen’s Getting Things Done famously proposes a system of lists and weekly review sessions.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Lists work because writing a task into a notebook permits you to forget about it temporarily. Keeping a written list of <em>IN</em> tasks helps you relax about your obligations, so that instead of incessantly worrying about things falling through the cracks, you can be confident that the task is stashed away in a secure place. You know you’ll return to the tasks in your review session, which has a pre-scheduled spot in your calendar.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to coding. FIXMEs are powerful because programming is a cognitively demanding activity. There are limits to how many concepts we can grasp at any given time. In juggling, the number of balls an average person can keep in the air is three.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> How many ideas can a person actively keep in their head at the same time? Perhaps more than three, but by most counts the number of ideas we can juggle is depressingly low. To switch metaphors, the programmer’s RAM or working memory is a scarce resource. Sure, there’s a spectrum here – some people can retain more data in memory than others. But if not careful, even the best programmer quickly runs out of heap.</p>
<p>We can push the analogy even further. Think of how effective pair programming is when working through a hard problem. The Linux virtual memory system allows the user to double their RAM by making use of spare hard drive capacity. Similarly, the pairing partner temporarily expands the programmer’s working memory by allowing them access to part of their cognitive capacity. Writing down FIXMEs achieves a similar effect. Whereas in a pairing session you extend your cognitive capacity with help from your partner, FIXMEs allow you to swap to disk. You remove an idea from your working memory, with the intention of paging it back in as needed, usually at the end of the session.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-inherent-complexity">Focus on the inherent complexity</h2>
<p>The net effect of temporarily transferring inessential questions to swap space is improved focus on the inherent complexity of the problem, the solution to which is the ultimate goal. Accidental complexity has a talismanic quality. We have an unfortunate but understandable tendency to get distracted by mere details of how to express an idea in code. It is true that eventually we will need a decision about the accidental aspects of the problem, but as a rule it is better to tackle the essential complexity first. The rest is FIXMEs.</p>
<p>Your brain is prone to worrying that you may after all forget about the hardcoded value left in the code or the quadratic complexity that might blow up in production. People will be angry at you, or, what may be worse, you’ll blame yourself. Whether we like it or not, emotions and other sub-conscious processes play a big role in our ability to focus. The unconscious mind will not allow itself to stop worrying about a task unless it is written down, with a system in place ensuring you will circle back to the topic without risking emotional backlash. Writing down FIXMEs has a liberating effect. With CI as a safety net, the brain can relax.</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-of-eliminating-fixmes">Three ways of eliminating FIXMEs</h2>
<p>After moving the distraction out of the way, you can focus on the core problem. When your RAM isn’t cluttered with inessential details, the clearer view gives you a better shot at seeing the solution. At some point, of course, you will need to go back to the problem you snoozed. Having reached this point, eliminating the FIXME can take one of three possible forms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Perhaps surprisingly, you may be able to simply delete the FIXME at this point. Sometimes things fall into place. In the process of implementing the main logic, you often end up solving the incidental issue as a consequence of the approach chosen, perhaps without even realizing it. Additionally, addressing the essential complexity puts you in a better position to understand the original incidental problem. Equipped with this knowledge, you may realize there’s nothing left to fix. Perhaps in practice n is always 3, so O(n2) complexity is perfectly fine. Or you recognize that, with the confidence gained from completing an implementation, your worry was about something that wasn’t worth worrying about in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible resolution is to face the problem head-on by performing the task you anticipated initially, for instance refactoring the code to get access to the user-id you needed or rewriting the algorithm to require O(n) iterations instead of O(n2). Frequently, a test case needs to be added as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you can choose to downgrade the FIXME to TODO status. A TODO can remind you that the concern should be addressed at some point in the future. Often, filing a follow-up issue in your bug tracker will help make sure that the matter is not forgotten.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Filing a follow-up is not always what we would prefer, but it’s a valuable tool, especially when …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

However, after being funded, they started adding more features to appeal to the needs of broader markets (the VC model of funding) which pissed off loyal users and caused them to leave the app. Some users say “The VCs would rather the product be ruined than miss an opportunity for 100–1000x, and if you don’t agree they will install adult supervision to do their bidding.”</p><p id="1c38">Now that you know the major downsides, let’s explore the top alternatives to Evernote.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Bear — Evernote alternative" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2496/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU" width="1248" height="684" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2264"><a href="https://bear.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bear</a> is a beautifully-designed app that makes the note-taking process easier and smoother.

    <p>This 100 page document has recently made the rounds: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zao_AyBhNb8TPWrQqgXn5NzNAgfEqzTIaFYos7wdqGI/edit#"><em>Thiel on Progress and Stagnation</em></a>. Despite looking quite comprehensive, I was surprised to see that quite a few of Thiel’s online writings were absent from the references section. Maybe the creators of the document left those out on purpose, but I suspect they might just not have been aware of them. A lot of Thiel’s online writings appear in relatively obscure places, and I haven’t been able to find a good list that includes all of them. So here is a list of everything Peter Thiel has <em>written online</em>, as far as I’m aware of:</p>

        <p>Pushing the limits of mobility and performance has become easier now that the iPad Pro has the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXQT2LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11%E2%80%91inch-2nd-generation-us-english">Magic Keyboard</a> and Visual Studio Code can be web-based as <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server">code-server</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It’s pretty nice but has some shortcomings. This article covers both the workflow and <a href="https://gitlab.com/mterhar/code-server-buildtools">configuration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-workflow">Summary of the workflow</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wake iPad, attach keyboard</li>
<li>Open your code-server url</li>
<li>Checkout repo (or resume existing)</li>
<li>Preview markdown, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">code spell checker</a></li>
<li><code>Cmd+shift+C</code> to open a console and run build, test, etc</li>
<li>Commit updates, get immediate pipeline feedback from <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow">GitLab plugin</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="not-for-everyone">Not for everyone</h2>
<p>Depending on the types of software being developed, the deficiencies in this workflow may overwhelm the benefits.  I talk about some of the problems with the workflow later on. If you want to be talked out of it, <a href="#problems">check that out first</a>. Otherwise, read on for all the neat outcomes and surprises.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Portable device</li>
<li>Long battery</li>
<li>Drawings and illustrations</li>
<li>Cloudy and containerized work</li>
</ol>

<p>For the following barrage of screenshots, they are from when I was working on <a href="https://brownfield.dev/post/2020-07-05-introducing-lab-assistant/">Lab Assistant</a> from my iPad. It seemed like a good place to start recording some of the ease and struggles.</p>

<p>When starting on a new project or picking up work on this device for the first time, from that home location pull up a terminal (<code>Cmd+Shift+C</code>) and run <code>git clone</code>. This will create the new directory and fill it up with code.  If it’s a microservice situation, create a directory and clone all the various repos into that.</p>

<p>Other Visual Studio Code plugins can be used to make the development experience more enjoyable. Since it’s a new IDE for me, I only hae YAML, Golang, and GitLab so far.</p>

<p>Sadly, uploading images directly to GitLab is one-at-a-time so squashing commits is much more important.  It’s also hard to format images for the web.</p>
<h3 id="switching-gears-to-blog-post">Switching gears to blog post</h3>
<p>The go workflow is pretty slick. Not a lot of stuff missing with the basics.  I’m also trying to use this workflow for making the blog post you’re reading right now.  Drafting the text is nice and easy. The spell checker plugin makes it better than my standard <code>Sublime -&gt; MS Word</code> workflow.</p>
<p>The biggest deficiency is image formatting and organization.  The iPad is great for making diagrams but once the images are saved, getting them into a web-optimized format and loaded into the repository is a hassle. Especially because you can only upload one file at a time to GitLab’s “upload file” interface. I did realize the WebIDE can do multiple uploads, but only too late.</p>
<p>Once the files are in the repo, they’re gigantic PNG files which should be shrunk, cropped, and optimized for web display. I need to find some tool to plug this gap in my creative work.</p>

<p>Every change to the code is detected and the site is rebuilt. Since code-server saves the files every time you stop typing, it leads to a lot of rebuilds. The good news is that they take a dozen milliseconds each.</p>

<p>This review app URL in my configuration is tied to a DNS and internal IP address so it’s only accessible to me and others within my network or on a VPN. If you’re working on something public, exposing and sharing the review app may help with reviews and collaboration. It’s probably easier to just use <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/">GitLab’s review apps</a> in that case though.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-conclusions">Workflow conclusions</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that using an 11-inch iPad Pro with the magic keyboard is a nice way to work comfortably anywhere. Even if the work is relatively intensive coding or authoring.</p>

<p>I will continue to use this workflow for a month or two and update about what enhancements come up or if I abandon it eventually.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is about how I arrived at this setup, what it took to get it configured, and how I plan on managing it.</p>
<h2 id="how-things-were">How things were</h2>
<p>For the past few years, I’ve been trying to find a lightweight way to get all the benefits of cloud and remote computing while having a comfortable and minimal developer experience. Small devices that were attempted in the past had too many compromises related to performance and feedback.</p>
<p>The prior evaluations have been erratic because it’s tough to tell which combination of physical devices and services can yield a favorable result. Here are some of the things I’ve tried that didn’t pan out.</p>
<p>All of the below are working from an iPad using various Apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>MacBook 11 inch air:  Screen was very low resolution, performance lacking</li>
<li>MacBook 12 inch:  At the time, I had a requirement for windows development and the devices (even i7) couldn’t seem to keep up with visual studio in debug mode plus a database</li>
<li>iPad GitLab’s built-in WebIDE: lack of terminals and listing and compilers, feedback loop through pipelines is too slow</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Working Copy</strong> for git repos: great repo management and multi-file workflow, same lack of terminals and pipeline-based feedback</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Screens</strong> with full MacOS on the tiny screen: native workflow so pretty good but exceptionally expensive and clipboard troubles make it frustrating</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Prompt</strong> to use a Linux shell to do things: good for administrative but session time-outs and multi-file editing is poor experience</li>
</ol>
<p>I was recently convinced to try Visual Studio Code and noticed that it has a code-server hosted web editor option. <strong>Evaluation time!</strong></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-code-server">Setting up code-server</h2>
<p>The Visual Studio Code installation is a regular software installer on MacOS. Just install it. Super easy.</p>
<p>The code-server installation has some options like a simple web server that runs on the same Mac system. I consider this to be a copy of the <code>Screens</code> workflow so I’m not going to try this.</p>
<p>There is a code-server installation option that is to run as a container. This piqued my interest since containers are neat and flexible. This can be combined with the GitLab CI pipeline to build replacement custom containers to increase the built-in capabilities.  Linuxserver.io offers this with a templating/overlay mechanism to make some of the same enhancements I have done.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-kubernetes">Why not Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>In the interest of doing everything the hardest way imaginable, I took the code-server docker container and spun it up in my local Kubernetes cluster so I could benefit from the infrastructure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ingress to a friendly domain name</li>
<li>Certificates issued from Lets Encrypt</li>
<li>Resilience and fail-over</li>
<li>Ephemeral filesystem as a scratchpad</li>
<li>Persistent storage for home directory</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ingress">Ingress</h3>
<p>The main ingress configuration to access <code>code.p.terharlab.com</code> is set to connect to the code-server service.</p>
<p>I also added a Kubernetes service for 1313 and an Ingress mapping my internal load balancer to that service. Now I can pull up <code>hugo server --bind=0.0.0.0 --appendPort=false --baseURL={hugo ingress}</code> And it will attach to a service. I attached this Hugo port to an internal ingress rather than the public one to keep it walled off from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="resilience-and-fail-over">Resilience and fail-over</h3>
<p>Since the storage is external to the pod, if the pod moves around, the storage will be re-attached. The kubelet scheduler will make sure a code-server keeps running and if it moves from one node to another, the ingress and services will reconfigure to get traffic to the right place.</p>
<h3 id="ephemeral-filesystem">Ephemeral filesystem</h3>
<p>When running the container, if you want to add something like golang or a different version of python, it’s easy enough. Just run <code>apt-get</code> or download binaries and put them in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. If there is a problem with the tool, just restart the pod and it’ll go away since <code>/usr</code> and <code>/etc</code> are ephemeral.</p>
<p>I followed the enhancement process below to add <code>go</code>, <code>hugo</code>, <code>kubectl</code>, and <code>helm</code> to the image so I can build my lab-assistant application and post to my blog. This just requires updating the <code>Dockerfile</code> and restarting the pod to get the new container.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-storage">Persistent storage</h3>
<p>To be sure that the day-to-day configuration updates don’t get lost in the ether when the container restarts, the entire <code>/home/coder</code> directory is in the persistent volume. In my environment, this creates an iscsi volume and attaches it to the container to preserve:</p>
<ul>
<li>dotfiles</li>
<li>repositories</li>
<li>go (packages)</li>
<li><code>/home/coder/.local/share/code-server</code>
<ul>
<li>extensions</li>
<li>logs</li>
<li>config files</li>
<li>spell checker library</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Subsequently, Facebook barred multiple&nbsp;individuals from its platform — including&nbsp;far-right political activist&nbsp;Faith Goldy and "white nationalist"&nbsp;Kevin Goudreau — and a host of&nbsp;groups, including the Soldiers of Odin, the Canadian Nationalist Front, the Aryan Strikeforce and the Wolves of Odin.</p>  <p>Facebook is under fire from those who accuse it of&nbsp;allowing hatred to spread on its platform.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/snap-says-facebook-ad-boycotts-opened-the-door-with-advertisers.html">A consumer boycott&nbsp;campaign</a> has led top brands like Unilever, Adidas and Microsoft to pull their ads from Facebook.</p>  <p>Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook Canada, said the partnership with Ontario Tech&nbsp;has been in the works for a while.</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook originally planned to announce the partnership in March but it was delayed by the pandemic.</p>  <p>The agreement with the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism is above and beyond Facebook's current attempts to keep online hate off its platform; Chan said he hopes it will help the social media giant spot emerging tactics and trends.</p>  <p>"Our challenge ... is to better understand how these trends are evolving and to stay one step ahead of them," he said.</p>  <h2>A global hub for studying online hate</h2>  <p>The money will allow the centre to hire an additional person and, according to a media release from Facebook and Ontario Tech,&nbsp;is meant to help it become a "go to" knowledge hub on hate and violent extremism,&nbsp;"providing high-level expertise to national, international and global partners through evidence based education, training and programming."</p>  <p>While critics may say that $500,000 over five years is too little, too late, Perry said it will make a big difference to her organization's ability to monitor hate and violent extremism online.</p>  <p>Separately, Perry's centre also&nbsp;has received funding from the federal Department of Public Safety and the Department of National Defence.</p>    <p>Perry said there has been an increase in far right activity online in Canada. A recent <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Online-Environmental-Scan-of-Right-wing-Extremism-in-Canada-ISD.pdf">interim study</a> by her centre and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue between January 2019 and January 2020 identified&nbsp;6,600 Canadian groups, channels, accounts and pages identified with right-wing extremism&nbsp;across seven social media platforms — sites which&nbsp;collectively reached&nbsp;over 11 million users.</p>  <p>She said&nbsp;far-right supporters also&nbsp;have been showing up at anti-lockdown protests in Canada, and have crashed&nbsp;Black Lives Matter demonstrations to disrupt them.</p>  <p>"We're seeing increased rates of uncivil and hateful behaviour online coming from people who don't affiliate with these groups, so they are nonetheless absorbing some of those narratives and some of that sentiment," she said.&nbsp;"At the extreme, there are people who are acting on these sentiments."</p>  <p>Perry said the most dangerous threats&nbsp;emerging online&nbsp;are the incel movement and so-called "accelerationist" groups like the pro-gun, anti-government Boogaloo Boys, who believe that America is headed for a second civil&nbsp;war and want to speed its arrival.</p>  <p><strong>Watch: Far-right Boogaloo movement gathers steam in Canada</strong></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>A loose collective known as the Boogaloo movement has been in the spotlight in recent weeks.

By the end of the year, he said,&nbsp;it plans to overhaul its advertising system to prevent people from placing discriminatory ads for things like jobs, credit or housing.</p>  <p>Facebook also&nbsp;is planning a series of roundtables in the fall on social justice and anti-discrimination measures, including one on Indigenous questions.</p>  <p><em>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <a href="mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>By the end of this article, youâ€™ll have a new tool in your toolbox to help newcomers quickly discover how your software project works, while reducing the time you explicitly spend introducing new folks to your project.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Ramping up on a new software project is hard</strong>, both for the person ramping up and for the team that supports this personâ€™s onboarding process. Itâ€™s especially worse when multiple people start onboarding the same project at the same time, which happened to my team recently: our projectâ€™s area of influence has grown quickly recently, and as a result, weâ€™re seeing dozens of developers starting to contribute to the project.</p>

<p>This sudden spike in interest lead to what I call â€œonboarding loadâ€� for our core team, as we suddenly faced pressure to help newcomers learn and navigate the codebase, while simulteanously trying to keep up with our day-to-day tasks.</p>

<h3 id="deflecting-pressure">Deflecting pressure</h3>

<p>To reduce this pressure on our core team, I recently introduced a â€œcode walkthroughâ€� in the projectâ€™s codebase. Itâ€™s essentially a collection of high-quality, high-context code comments â€œtaggedâ€� with a <code>[docs/walkthrough]</code> line comment. When newcomers come our way and want to learn more about our project, I point them to a GitHub search for that special identifier in the projectâ€™s codebase to pull up all those great code comments to learn about the project. (They could also clone the code locally and search for that identifier using their code editor, but a GitHub search is available to everyone.)</p>

<p>Here are some examples of such high-context comments and the different purposes they serve:</p>

<p><strong>Navigation and flow</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# This module is responsible for generating the content to insert in the &lt;head&gt;
# HTML tag across all pages.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# This class is the entrypoint to all output generation. From here, content
# flows down into controllers, then into serializers and formatters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# This is an example of an implementation that doesn't feel like it's the
# right way to do it, but after looking at profiles and traces, we know
# that this implementation performs better than a SQL-only solution.
#
# There's currently no good index on the `xyz` table to quickly search
# for nested values, so it ends up being faster to filter through all
# values in Ruby than it is to filter those out using a `WHERE`
# clause at the database level. We're looking into remodeling this data.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Trivia</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# Even though this class usually handles objects of type X, this one
# is an exception because it can be overridden by people manually creating
# resource of the same name.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Resiliency</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# Historically, we kept track of the resource count by incrementing a value in a
# key-value store whenever a resource was created. However, because of scaling
# constraints, we started tracking this value using a proper data ETL process.
# We now simply read the count from that data store and cache it aggressively.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# By default, this class (including its subclasses) doesn't expose any method
# to the outside world. To do so, methods must be marked with the "world_public" 
# identifier. This is a safe-by-default way to avoid allocating wrapper objects,
# while still allowing public methods to be created for internal use.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The benefit of this approach is that the documentation is built into the code, so the risk that it becomes stale or outdated is much lower than if that documentation lived outside of the code itself.</p>

<p>One thing you can play around with is moving up and down levels of abstraction throughout the comments. Some of them may explain why a specific function is implemented this way, while others may explain the business domain history behind this legacy module.</p>

<h3 id="sounds-great-how-do-i-get-started">Sounds great! How do I get started?</h3>

<p>As a starting point, identify existing high-quality comments in your project, and tag them with the special identifier of your choice. Then, look for areas in the codebase that would benefit from having a little bit more context and documentation, and take some time to write clear, helpful comments that you can add that special tag to. Finally, once you have a generous collection of high-quality comments with that special identifier, start pointing newcomers to search for this identifier, and let them soak up all that context.</p>

<p>As the documentation shepherd on your team, always be on the lookout for opportunities to write more of those high-context code comments: youâ€™ll be rewarded for it in the future, either by your colleagues thanking you for writing those comments that helped them step up quickly, or by your boss for reducing the â€œonboarding loadâ€� I mentioned earlier on the rest of the team, who instead were able to focus on the task at hand.</p>

<p>Great software documentation is like a flywheel. Itâ€™s hard to write at first, and the return on investment is not immediately visible. But with time, it compounds, and eventually, youâ€™ll wonder how you managed to live without it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have started to be more conscious about privacy over the Internet, and one of the most important aspects to take care of when talking about privacy and security is where to store your passwords, as important as what passwords you use.</p>

<p>Most people (including me until some weeks ago) use the same password everywhere to easily remember it later.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to use iOS, Google or Firefox password tools, the problem with that is that you are forced into their ecosystem, and one should always think about who <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/your-passwords-online.html">let in charge of your keys</a></p>



<p>It is impossible to keep a lot of passwords in our memory, and writing them down is not a good idea either. I started to keep them in a text file encrypted with a password, but it was not the best solution.</p>

<p>So I started to use Chrome password manager, but I  did not want to install it on the iPad, even on the PC, I started using Firefox on the laptop too.</p>

<p>So I started to look for an independent password manager tool, but almost all of them required a paid account. And I wanted to have full control over my passwords. So, I decided to use Bitwarden, because there is a self-hosted option</p>

<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>

<p>Bitwarden is an Open Source password manager tool, you can host in your server with Docker, this is maybe the most secure way to manage your passwords because you are in full control of them. Of course, they are on a server open to the Internet so they will never be completely secure.</p>

<h3 id="main-features">Main features</h3>

<h4 id="different-type-of-containers">Different type of containers</h4>

<p>Bitwarden is not only useful to manage your passwords, but it can also be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Login Passwords</strong>: As all main tools, it records the url, the username, and password.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit Cards</strong>: Credit cards can also be stored on Bitwarden server</li>
  <li><strong>Identity</strong>: You can store all data of your identity, like Passport number, Social Security number, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Note</strong>: This feature I use a lot, they are like post-it, but secure post-it, I mainly use them to store the keys to unlock sites when 2FA fail, I keep the scratch codes in there.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="password-generator">Password Generator</h4>

<p>Of course, you can generate the password with the tool, and adjust the type of password you want.</p>

<p>You can generate passwords of different sizes, from 5 to 128 characters, and if the password will contain: Upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters. You can also set the minimum quantity of numbers and special characters.</p>

<h4 id="export-and-import">Export and Import</h4>

<p>You can export and import the data, this must be done carefully, because it is exported a plain text document, and that document should be deleted once it is not needed anymore.</p>

<h4 id="reports">Reports</h4>

<p>Bitwarden offers different reports that help you a lot to keep your credentials secure</p>

<h5 id="exposed-password-report">Exposed Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one of the best features it has, it shows you all the passwords you use that has been exposed on the web because someplace you used them has been hacked.</p>

<p>Be sure the change all passwords that appear on this report.</p>

<h5 id="reused-password-report">Reused Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one is pretty self-explanatory, this report shows all sites where you have used the same password, try to change all of them to random passwords, if one site is compromised the hackers will not gain access to other sites where you use the same login and password.</p>

<h5 id="weak-password-report">Weak Password Report</h5>

<p>Here you can review all accounts that have weak passwords, usually the same where you have reused passwords. Keep all passwords randomly generated, and with long strings, no less than 14 characters.</p>

<h5 id="unsecured-sites-report">Unsecured Sites Report</h5>

<p>Here you will have listed all sites where you have an account that does not use SSL, in other words, the signing url is http and not https, on this sites you should of course use unique passwords, as it is easier to lose that password, and the hacker should not be able to use it in any other site.</p>

<h5 id="inactive-two-factor-authentication">Inactive two-factor authentication</h5>

<p>In this report, it will be listed all sites where 2FA is available, but you do not have it enabled, be sure to use 2FA on every site that has available. This way even if your password gets compromised, nobody will be able to access your info on that site.</p>

<h5 id="data-breach-report">Data Breach Report</h5>

<p>You can check here if your user name or email has been compromised in any data breach.</p>

<p>The report will show you what info has been made public together with your email address or login, the only thing you can do, is to change the passwords you used on those sites.</p>

<h4 id="two-step-login">Two-Step Login</h4>

<p>Your Bitwarden account can also be secured by enabling 2FA, you have these options to set it up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authenticator APP: Like the ones from Google, Microsoft or Authy.</li>
  <li>Yubico: You need to buy a hardware YubiKey to use this method.</li>
  <li>Duo.com: You need an account with them</li>
  <li>Fido:  This one is also from Yubico</li>
  <li>Email: You will get an email with the code every time you want to login</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-hosted-options">Self Hosted Options</h3>

<h4 id="official-apps">Official Apps</h4>

<p>You have good documentation on the site to host it on your server with Docker:</p>

<p>You will need to install at least <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/server">the server</a> which you can use with your browser extension and your mobile app.</p>

<p>But there is another option for your personal use.</p>

<h4 id="bitwardenrs">Bitwarden_rs</h4>

<p>This one is the option for  persona use, it is small and also have all features the official one.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs">installation instructions here</a></p>

<p>But, here I will let you how I installed on my server.</p>

<pre><code>version: '3.3'
services:
  server:
    restart: always
    container_name: bitwarden
    volumes:
      - 'bw-data:/data/'
    ports:
      - '8888:80'
    image: 'bitwardenrs/server:latest'
    labels:
      - "docker-volume-backup.stop-during-backup=true"
  backup:
    image: futurice/docker-volume-backup:2.0.0
    environment:
      AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: XXXXXXX      # S3 bucket which you own, and already exists
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: YYYYYYYYYYY # Read AWS secrets from environment (or a .env file)
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # Allow use of the "stop-during-backup" feature
      - bw-data:/backup/bitwareden-backup:ro

volumes:
  bw-data:
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration, you will have two containers, one with Bitwarden, and the second one that will take care to back up your database to AWS S3 or any compatible option. Remember that your vault is encrypted.</p>

<p>You will now only need Nginx or Caddy in front of it, I am using Caddy 2, with this configuration:</p>

<pre><code>bw.mysite.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8888
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use Nginx, you will need something like this:</p>

<pre><code> location /{
  proxy_pass https://your_local_host:8888;
  proxy_redirect off;
  proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Url-Scheme $scheme;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Among with other server configurations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Consider using a Password Manager tool, I recommend you Bitwarden, but you can use anyone you trust, I know that NextCloud comes with an add-on for it too, I think that is also a great option, what you should not do, is to re-use passwords, or use weak passwords.</p>

<p>Security on the Internet is as important as security in the real world, and you do not let your home or car keys anywhere, you keep them secure and with you.</p>

But, <em>what on earth is that?</em></p><p>If you're not familiar, <strong>Static Generation</strong> is the process of dynamically generating pages at build time. For example, an e-commerce website might generate a static HTML page for each product in their catalog as oppose to the traditional approach of using a server to load in product information from a database.</p><p>This is nice because static HTML files are fast to serve.

For a site with thousands of articles or products, this could take a long time.</p><h2>Incremental Static Generation</h2><p>To address this issue, the Next.js contributors have been working on giving static pages the ability to be "revalidated" at runtime.</p><p>In practise, this works with the <code>revalidate</code> option in the <code>getStaticProps()</code> method of a Next.js page. The <code>revalidate</code> option, if specified, will instruct the page to be regenerated at a given interval.</p><p>When a user visits an "out of date" page, they will be served up a "stale" version.

<![CDATA[Trouble at Intel]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Late last week, Intel announced that <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/ceo-remarks-earnings-call-2Q2020.pdf">they were delaying their next generation of chips</a>. This is big news and the stock took a tumble after the announcement. This has big implications for the whole industry, and arguably the world.</p>



<p>The issue is that they announced a delay of their 7nm chips by six months. They were already behind schedule with 7nm, by contrast TSMC has been shipping others’ 7nm products for over six months. The fact that this comes on top of Intel hitting 10nm roughly two years behind schedule speaks to two big challenges for the company. </p>



<p>First, this has all sorts of impact on their financial results. Not least, they do not have sufficient capacity for their trailing edge, 14nm process, which has crimped revenue from their inability to meet demand. This hurts the whole PC ecosystem, as large companies delay their purchases of hardware which ripples through the whole supply chain. </p>



<p>This also opens the door for Intel’s competitors. On the PC side, <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/06/23/apple-silicon-first-impressions/">this makes Apple’s move to their own silicon</a> even more important. Apple likely knew of Intel’s delay a few months ago, and likely catalyzed them to move even faster with their transition. More importantly, it creates a big problem for Intel in the data center, which is their largest profit driver. Server customers want the best performance. Cloud scale providers – <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/06/17/intel-follow-up-data-centers/">who consume something like 70% of Intel’s data center products</a> – make purchases based on performance per dollar per watt. Any competing product just got a big leg up in that math. All those competitors are using 7nm now, and basically have a year to further erode Intel’s once-dominant share. There are other factors that will keep those customers using Intel, but the math plays a big role in determining the purchase decisions. For companies like AMD and privately-held Ampere, this is very good news. It also gives a big boost to anyone else who still has an ARM CPU in the works, companies like Huawei and Amazon.</p>



<p>Beyond those immediate financial problems this news poses what we see as Intel’s identity crisis. For almost thirty years, the company has prided itself on producing the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology. They ceded that with the 10nm miss two years ago, but they could have convinced themselves that was a one-time fluke. Fool yourself once…. The rest of the world has moved <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2018/11/01/you-too-can-build-your-own-chip-for-only-30-million/">to a fabless model</a>, but for Intel that vertically integrated model goes to the core of their identity. Now it is not clear what they are.</p>



<p>After the announcement, the press focused on Intel’s admission that they would shift some GPU production to TSMC. This is a bit misleading as Intel has been producing chips at TSMC for close to a decade. They acquired Infineon’s mobile business Altera for FPGAs and have been running those as fabless through TSMC since acquisition. In hindsight, the fact that they could never shift those to internal production should have been viewed a major Defcon-1 Red Flag. </p>



<p>And this leads into the geopolitical realm. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/07/09/the-five-year-plan-for-semiconductors/">The whole industry has </a>recently woken up to the strategic value of Taiwan’s TSMC. In our earlier writing on the geopolitics of chips we have been careful to call out the fact the US does (did?) have advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. With Intel lagging, TSMC’s unique position becomes all the more apparent. </p>



<p>Intel still has a lot working in its favor. They still make a lot of money, $10 billion in the latest quarter. They have a tremendous reserve of talent, especially if recent executive changes means they can rehire employees who have exited over the past few years. They will get to 7nm eventually, and still have a credible path to 5nm and whatever lays beyond that. </p>



<p>That being said, Intel needs to think long and hard about its future. Do they want to be a 3rd party foundry and produce chips for others? They could still do that, but it would require tens of billions of dollars of investment, starting right now. Stay the course and milk the markets they still dominate? That sounds tolerable, but it is effectively the strategy they have employed for the past ten years, thus not sustainable indefinitely. Probably the best thing they could do would be to hunker down and invest heavily in their existing team, committing to never missing a deadline again. This would lkely require big organizational change and a major investment. Long ago, we semi-joked that <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2018/07/26/a-proposal-for-intel-time-to-go-private/">Intel should go private</a> and make the required changes away from the spotlight of the public market. That particular financial structure remains far-fetched, but the depth of change required still pertains. Intel needs to fix itself, and no amount of government subsidy will alter that. </p>

</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code should compile without any issues and produce the executable program 'a.out'. &nbsp;You can run this program with this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>./a.out
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that code does not represent a <em>fast</em> implementation of the regular expression (in fact it's one of the slowest implementations possible). &nbsp;The goal here is to produce a program that is very short and easy to understand for educational purposes rather than to produce one that is fast and complicated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, you'll find an interactive visualization that you can use to simulate regular expressions. &nbsp;You can type any regular expression and the tool will automatically create two diagrams that correspond to your regular expression. &nbsp;Both of these diagrams are interactive, zoomable and include support for a fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first diagram is a parse tree. &nbsp;Constructing a parse tree is the first step that a regular expression engine will perform in order to decide what meaning each character will have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can click on individual nodes in the parse tree to highlight the corresponding character in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can also go the other way and click on individual characters in the regular expression to quickly find the corresponding characters in the parse tree. &nbsp;By reviewing how the characters are grouped together in the parse tree, you can gain insights about the meanings of individual characters and how they relate to each other in the regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second diagram shows a control flow graph corresponding to your regular expression. &nbsp;This control flow graph illustrates the step by step process that is undertaken whenever your regex is matched against a piece of text. &nbsp; When attempting to match your regular expression, the process starts at the 'BEGIN' node and ends at either the 'MATCH' or 'FAILURE' node. &nbsp;Any path from the 'BEGIN' node to the 'MATCH' node corresponds to a piece of text that matches your regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nodes in the control flow graph correspond directly to one or more characters in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see the corresponding nodes highlighted in your original regular expression and the parse tree. &nbsp;Also note that clicking on characters in your regex will also highlight any associated nodes in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's difficult to truly understand how your regular expression works without seeing the decisions it makes when attempting to match a given piece of text. &nbsp;For this reason, every time you make changes to your regular expression, this visualization tool will automatically generate a piece of text that contains at least one match to your regular expression. &nbsp;If you want to review how the matching process work with your own customized piece of text, simply change the input value for the search string and the animation will update automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of matching the regular expression starts at the 'BEGIN' node and continues by following the arrows to arrive at the nodes that actually do the work of the regular expression itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of writing this sentence, all regular expressions that this visualizer tool supports are ultimately transformed into an control flow graph that consists of the following 5 types of nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) &nbsp;<strong>CHAR</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a specific character at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;If the character matches, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>2) &nbsp;<strong>CLASS</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a class of characters at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;This node type effectively does the same thing as the first node type, except it allows for more than one possible character at the current position in the search text. &nbsp;If the current character in the text is among the list of acceptable characters specified by this node, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>3) &nbsp;<strong>SPLIT</strong>&nbsp;This node type performs a 'split' operation. &nbsp;This is a situation where the regular expression matcher has a more than one possible path to continue through the control flow graph. &nbsp;In programming terms, this node effectively does the same thing as forking a process or splitting off work into two separate threads. &nbsp;This can also be implemented in a single thread by trying both paths one at time and pushing saved information onto a stack. &nbsp;In computer science theory, this node type should remind you of the difference between DFAs and NFAs.</li>
<li>4) &nbsp;<strong>ANCHOR</strong>&nbsp;This node type represents the commonly used 'beginning of string' or 'end of string' regular expression characters. &nbsp;This node is type is quite simple, as it simply checks whether the current position in the string is, respectively, at the first position, or the last position. &nbsp;If the check succeeds, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>5) &nbsp;<strong>PROGRESS</strong>&nbsp;This node type is necessary to avoid infinite loops in certain regular expressions that can include repetitions of possibly zero length strings. &nbsp;Without this node, there are cases where the control flow graph could potentially contain cycles that cause us to move around forever without making any progress. &nbsp;Each time a progress node is visited, it makes sure that we've made some progress in matching the regex since the last visit. &nbsp;If we have made progress, we move to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If not, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may find it surprising, but most commonly used regular expressions can be described in terms of the above 5 simple node types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of this visualization tool is help you understand the precise meaning of the characters in a regular expression. &nbsp;Therefore, this the tool will also cross-compile your regular expression into a hard-coded C program that implements a search for the regex pattern that you specified. &nbsp;Each of the nodes in the control flow graph has a direct correspondence to several lines of C source code that are expressed below the two diagrams. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see which lines of code correspond to the node that you've selected.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_this_character(current_character, CHARACTER_TO_MATCH)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the implementation of a 'CHAR' node, we first use the 'safely_get_character' function to pick out the next character from the string being searched. &nbsp;The implementation of the 'safely_get_character' function is listed above in the 'Common C Code' section. &nbsp;This function is very simple since it just checks to make sure we're still within the bounds of the string that's being search, and if so, it returns character at the current position. &nbsp;If we're past the end of the string, we just directly exit the process. &nbsp;This corresponds to moving to the 'failure' node in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we've obtained the current character, we check to make sure that it matches the literal character that was specified in the regular expression using the 'matches_this_character' function. &nbsp;Here is the implementation of the matches_this_character function. &nbsp;As you can see, this function is very simple since it just checks to make sure that the current character in the string being searched is the same as the literal character that was supplied in the regex.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_one_of_these_characters(current_character, NUM_CHARACTERS, CHARACTER_1, CHARACTER_2, CHARACTER_3, ..., CHARACTER_N)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the 'CLASS' node …</p></div></div>

    <p>Back in the Renaissance, having skill in many different areas was seen as a good thing. But things changed. Movements such as the industrial revolution required individuals to specialize in one task to repeat it over and over and over—like cogs.</p>
<p>The phrase, "Jack of all trades, master of none," has been used to negatively refer to people who engaged in eclectic activities. Even in today's culture, doing different activities with less specialization has bad connotations.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with <em>portfolio careerist</em> Carmen Chamorro for a new episode of Getting Simple. We talked about the benefits of working in different fields, managing multiple interests, and how recognizing a potential Renaissance-like profile might positively influence your career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust your nature. Be you. Don't be scared. We are all needed and we are all here. There is a balance in the world. We just need to go to the right place of the puzzle. You are here with a profile, and you are here to use it and to be authentic. Trust yourself, accept yourself, and have fun. —Carmen Chamorro</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started at Facebook back in 2012, it was developed internally before being released as open-source in 2015. In 2018 the project was moved to the newly created GraphQL Foundation, hosted by the Linux foundation. GraphQL creator Lee Byron has stated his aim is to make it ubiquitous across web platforms. Let’s look at how plausible that perspective is.</p>
<h2>A bit of theory</h2>
<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs, its main advantage is allowing clients to define exactly what type of data is required. Developers create a schema that contains all the data clients can query through the service. This schema contains object types that determine the object you can request and the types it has. The schema is the basis all queries get checked against and then, after being validated, executed. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.

<h2>A bit of practice</h2>
<p>Let’s check out how it actually works by looking at a simple example like a forum, blog or social media. In our example let’s say users have four properties: username, email, location and ID and can create posts with titles. Now if you need to create a profile component that only shows the username and ID, you don’t need the user’s email and location. With REST and other web service architectures, the API returns all user data and there’s no way to request specifically what you need without fetching unnecessary data. Doesn’t sound like a big problem? Just look at Facebook accounts and how many variables they have and you’ll easily get why they started developing GraphQL.</p>

    </span></a></p>
<p>GraphQL allows you to request exactly the parameters you want and the API responds with only the data you requested. It also does this via a single endpoint that handles all the client’s requests. That was just a basic query. One of the advantages of GraphQL is the ability to nest queries so it can be expanded to fetch a number of variables. </p>

    </span></a></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the above-mentioned example of a blog/forum/social media API. What if your profile component needs to be a bit more complex? We’ll make a query that requests some basic user info as well as post titles for that particular user so that the profile provides a glimpse of the user’s activity as well as basic information.</p>
<h2>Why development teams are adopting GraphQL?</h2>
<p>One of the surveys directed to a variety of companies having experience with GraphQL asked their CTOs and lead developers why they decided to pivot to GraphQL. The survey identified six main benefits (<em>Development Velocity, Modularity, Scalability, Performance, Reliability, Security</em>) and asked responders how strongly they would agree/disagree with the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We were able to speed up our development using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>We were able to scale our projects faster with GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>It was easier to unify our APIs (e.g., Microservices, legacy endpoints, third-party services, etc.)</em></li>
<li><em>There has been an increase in performance using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>Our architecture is more stable, with decreased downtime, and fewer errors</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The results are:</p>

<p>The interpretation of the survey’s results was summed up closed in the table below. The most important thought is that GraphQL managed to provide what teams were looking for that small to medium as well as large enterprise teams. </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team size</th>
<th>What they wanted to achieve</th>
<th>What they’ve achived</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>50-100 &amp; 100+ devs</td>
<td>Faster development speed, better scalability, better modularity</td>
<td>Faster development, better scalability</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10-50 devs</td>
<td>Better modularity, higher performance</td>
<td>Faster development, better infrastructure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>up to 10 devs</td>
<td>Faster development, better modularity</td>
<td>Faster development, better scalability</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Simple and flexible</h2>
<p>GraphQL not only straightforward, but it’s also extremely adaptable. GraphQL is client-driven and it’s creators emphasize they were focused on the needs of the client, not the server. That’s also why graphQL is so flexible so that it’s as easy as possible to use for clients.  You can use GraphQL with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python,</li>
<li>React </li>
<li>Java,</li>
<li>C++, </li>
<li>PHP, </li>
</ul>
<p>and a number of others as it’s meant to be a one size fits all solution that retrieves data regardless of the service, platform, or coding language. Can it become widely used across all platforms? Time will tell, but it certainly has all the tools for that.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

				<p>Remember the Ubuntu Unity spin edition that popped up a few months ago? Well, the same young developer behind that product is at it again. In a cryptic new Twitter post of only the words <em>“Coming soon! Stay tuned!”</em> from the new handle of <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu Web</a>, Rudra Saraswat has my attention.</p>
<p>The Twitter bio for this new account is really all we have to go on at this point, but color me intrigued. It seems to be positioned as an alternative to Chrome OS. Ironically, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-secret-origins-of-googles-chrome-os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project that became Chrome OS</a> was originally running a modified Firefox UI.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“<span>Ubuntu Web combines the power of Ubuntu &amp; Firefox to give you a powerful, open source web OS.</span>“</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As we move more and more to a cloud-focused future, the combination of Ubuntu running <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/new-years-resolution-try-using-firefox-full-time-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> in a dedicated UI could make for a pretty powerful mashup. And as someone who is already concerned with web standards moving towards a world of only tech surrounding the Chrome browser, it’s a welcome alternative.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coming soon! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>— Ubuntu Web (@ubunweb) <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb/status/1285993537499095040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While this isn’t the first time we’ve seen cloud-first distros in the world of Linux, I hope the team at Ubuntu Web can really find some traction. Rudra’s previous work with <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/my-three-weeks-with-the-system76-lemur-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a> could lay a decent groundwork. Unity had many cloud elements built into the interface that with some tweaking may be able to leverage new hooks powered by Firefox.</p>
<p>We wish the Ubuntu Web team luck in this new venture and we’ll keep a close eye on any progress of this intriguing project.</p>

<p>Before delving into <strong>Privacy and Data Protection Issues with the Adoption of SaaS</strong>, let’s look into <strong>Privacy</strong> as a whole in the real-world. One of the more obvious ways when it comes to data harvesting is through online shopping when we key in our details. However, there are less obvious ways like <a href="https://clearcode.cc/blog/what-is-data-broker/#:~:text=Data%20brokers%20(aka%20information%20brokers,with%20data%20from%20other%20sources%20(">data brokers creating profiles of online users</a>. There could be anywhere up to over 1300 data points collected; these could include data on sexuality, marital status, browsing history and political affiliations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html">Acxiom is supposed to have data on 10% of the world’s population</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Data-Brokers.png" alt="" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Data-Brokers.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>Caption: <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">What is your data worth?</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2013 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/intelligence-leaders-push-back-on-leakers-media/2013/06/09/fff80160-d122-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html">Edward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaks</a>, and indicated how there’s mass government surveillance taking place as well. <strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>Data Protection</strong> is a heavy topic that is even debated today across the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Privacy?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When considering <strong>Privacy</strong>, which is to do with <strong>Human Dignity</strong> and <strong>Autonomy</strong>, remember that <a href="http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_12.html">Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares Privacy as a human right</a> — “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence”. The article goes onto to say that the law is there to defend any individual who is subject to such interference.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protect-your-digital-footprint.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protect-your-digital-footprint.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>Caption: <a href="http://www.users.miamioh.edu/viscokj/IMS201/website/chapter-04.html">Protect your digital footprint</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, in legal terms <strong>Privacy</strong> is not an absolute right. National security or public safety are just two reasons where <strong>Privacy</strong> is not assured. But, what about the concept of <strong>Data Protection</strong>? <strong>Data Protection</strong> deals with how third parties collect, share, store, process and use information they have concerning us.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Data Protection in the Digital Age</h2>
<p>In the digital age, we exchange our data in order to use services, content and social media platforms.&nbsp; When you click Agree, you hand over your data to such platforms to utilize your information, which could mean selling it as well. In countries like Russia, Australia, and Brazil, their respective governments have access to our conversations, transactions and locations. Today, there are various internet policy forums like <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/">IGF</a>, the Council of Europe and OECD, and conferences like <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/cyfy/">CyFy</a> that are involved in shaping such concepts in the digital age. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/#:~:text=It's%20a%20security%20project%20that's,for%20which%20it%20offers%20apps.">WhatsApp in 2016 took the decision to install end-to-end encryption</a> all in the effort to secure the consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who read about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-facebook-privacy-awakening/">How Cambridge Analytica Sparked the Great Privacy Awakening</a> and/or watched how <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-great-hack-documentary/">Netflix’s&nbsp;<em>The Great Hack</em>&nbsp;Brings Our Data Nightmare to Life</a> will realize the importance of <strong>Data Privacy</strong>. The issue of privacy and its real-world intrigue is straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality of this can be seen in the diagram below:</p>

<p>A more worrying article would be about Google and how it literally is Big Brother: <a href="https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/google-collects-a-frightening-amount-of-data-about-you-you-can-find-and-delete-it-now/">Google collects a frightening amount of data about you</a>.&nbsp;All of these issues has led digital netizens to take matters into their own hands. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Anonymity tools like Tor</a> and encryption are widely used. Alternative digital business models, which are against the extraction and sale of data, are now largely considered. Over the last few years, the use of ad blockers have increased, and this has led companies to utilize advertising practices that are less invasive.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Does this Mean for SaaS?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Consider all that you have read thus far when it comes to <strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>Data Protection</strong>. Now, let’s move onto Saas, and <strong>Privacy and Data Protection Issues with the Adoption of SaaS</strong>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5q_RXk_t7A">Software-as-a-Service&nbsp;(SaaS)</a>&nbsp;is not just a cloud-based delivery model, but also a service that allows organizations to cater to their IT service management needs. SaaS applications have a lot of benefits: saving money and time, keeping an eye on technology budgets as opposed to infrastructure or gaining access to the newest innovations. </p>
<p>With all these advantages offered by SaaS products, remember that they can be a focus of interest to even hackers. This is why certain protocols need to be considered. </p>
<p>These protocols are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Encrypt your data</li><li>Make privacy a priority</li><li>Educate your customers</li><li>Back-up user data in several locations</li><li>Utilize stronger passwords</li></ol>
<p>For more information, we believe that the article <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/privacy-policy-saas/#Privacy_Policies_For_Saas_What_And_Why">Privacy Policy for a SaaS Business</a> is an excellent starting point when it comes to ensuring transparency and integrity.</p>
<h2>How Secure is Hyvor Talk?</h2>
<p>We wrote <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">19 Reasons to Move Away From Disqus</a> sometime back, and one of the main reasons to move away from Disqus is to do with the issue of privacy. Hyvor Talk is very secure and we take the aspect of privacy very seriously.</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyvor-Talk-Privacy-Policy.png" alt="" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyvor-Talk-Privacy-Policy.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>Caption: Part of <a href="https://hyvor.com/privacy-policy">our privacy policy</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/privacy-policy-common-issues/">One of the main issues with privacy policies today in the digital world</a> is the use of legalese, which makes the issue of understanding documentation very complicated. Complex terminology is something we have strayed away from, and have stuck to very simple descriptions. It needs to be reiterated that <strong>Hyvor Talk does not track users, and does not sell any data</strong> either, which are serious privacy issues faced by SaaS companies.</p>
<p>As a new commenting platform solution, Hyvor Talk, is fast changing how people interact with blogs, and it offers you a chance to understand our commenting platform and how different it is from its competitors. </p>
<p>To conclude, Hyvor Talk has a strong focus on SaaS security; and, we are focused on building trust in our product and to foster an ecosystem that customers feel comfortable using. As consumers become more knowledgeable regarding their personal security, there will be more secure products, which are sure to become a very attractive proposition to buyers.</p>

Despite that, we index and let you query <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/40k-sql-datasets">over 40,000 public datasets</a> with simple SQL.</p><p>This series of articles discusses our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/topic/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> and how we stay lean while still providing a lot of value to data scientists and engineers.</p><p>To run Splitgraph in production, we use Docker Compose. We found it to be a surprisingly effective solution. This article is a collection of tips and tricks for using Docker Compose that we discovered. We'll talk about:</p><ul><li>structuring a Compose dev-prod configuration using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends">override mixins</a></li><li>an automated deploy workflow</li><li>configuration generation, injection and live reloading</li><li>how we monitor our services in production</li></ul><section><h2 id="why-compose">Why Compose?</h2><p>We are eventually interested in moving to Kubernetes or Nomad (we're even writing a script that automatically converts Compose files to Nomad jobs!). But, these solutions felt like overkill for our use case.</p><p>Besides, we relied on Docker Compose a lot when building Splitgraph. Currently, we run <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/integration-tests">integration tests in CI</a> using it. We wanted to match the dev, CI and production workflow as closely as possible.</p></section><section><h2 id="compose-configs-and-mixins">Compose configs and mixins</h2><p>Docker Compose allows you to combine multiple Compose configurations into one at runtime. This feature is called <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends">"overrides"</a>.</p><p>Here's a sample Compose definition for a "prod" service:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.4"</span>
<span>services</span><span>:</span>
  <span>registry-db</span><span>:</span>

<span>...</span>
</code></pre><p>Our production configuration normally includes:</p><ul><li>The actual Docker image</li><li>A <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#restart" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#restart">policy</a> to automatically restart containers that exited with an error</li><li>Bind mounts of configuration files</li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#env_file" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#env_file">Environment files</a></li><li>Mounts of data volumes</li><li>Docker healthcheck definitions</li></ul><p>The development Compose file is a mixin on top of the production configuration. For this service, it's:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.4"</span>
<span>services</span><span>:</span>
  <span>registry-db</span><span>:</span>

</code></pre><p>This can include:</p><ul><li>Bind mounts for source code for scripted languages</li><li>Flags for verbose logging</li><li>Using a more heavyweight Docker image with dev tooling or hot reloads</li><li>Publishing ports on the host to aid debugging</li></ul><p>This lets us avoid repetition in our configuration. We also use this idea to split up different aspects of the stack into separate Compose files. We call these "service groups".</p><p>We have runscripts that wrap Compose overrides to give the developer a single script. They can use it to run Compose commands on a service group. The script can inject the "dev" configuration if needed:</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash -e

if [[ "$1" == "--dev" ]] ; then
  DEV=1
  shift
fi

export CONFIG_HOME=${CONFIG_HOME-"$PWD"}

exec docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
    $( [[ -n $DEV ]] &amp;&amp; echo "-f docker-compose.dev.yml" ) \
    -f docker-compose.dbs.build.yml \
    -f docker-compose.dbs.prod.yml \
    $( [[ -n $DEV ]] &amp;&amp; echo "-f docker-compose.dbs.dev.yml" ) $@
</code></pre></section><section><h2 id="deployment-workflow">Deployment workflow</h2><p>We deploy Splitgraph using GitLab CI. The deploy process runs in several stages.</p><section><h3 id="building-the-production-bundle">Building the production bundle</h3><p>First, we use our Makefile (we wrote more about how we use Makefiles in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/makefile">a previous blog post</a>) to build a "deploy bundle". This bundle is self-contained and includes only the files needed to run Splitgraph in production:</p><ul><li>Production Docker Compose configs</li><li>Runscripts that combine those configs into "service groups"</li><li>Other useful scripts for production: installation, backups, configuration management, helper script to load into the admin shell</li><li>Configuration templates</li></ul><p>We store the actual tag (commit hash) that we're deploying in a <code>.env</code> file in the bundle that every script sources.</p></section><section><h3 id="deploy-home-directory">Deploy home directory</h3><p>On the server, we have a "deploy home" directory that contains service configuration files. It also contains a <code>config.json</code> file that includes:</p><ul><li>configuration flags for the current deploy</li><li>secrets</li><li>third-party API keys</li></ul><p>The CI script copies the bundle into this directory and extracts it. We keep copies of previous deploy bundles too, each one in a timestamped directory. This means we can roll back to an earlier version in case of a failed deploy by running that bundle's installation script.</p></section><section><h3 id="pulling-and-tagging-the-containers">Pulling and tagging the containers</h3><p>The installation script first pulls all required containers from the GitLab CI registry. At this point, it uses the deploy's commit hash as the tag.</p><p>The script then retags these containers with a <code>:production</code> tag. This is to avoid Compose reloading all services on every deploy. If an image's tag (not only the SHA hash) has changed, Compose will treat the service's configuration as changed. Keeping the tag fixed prevents that.</p></section><section><h3 id="configuration-generation">Configuration generation</h3><p>The script then runs the "configurator". It's a container with a Python application that uses Jinja. It uses the bundle's config templates and the <code>config.json</code> file to regenerate configuration for all services that we run.</p><p>We wrote more about the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/integration-tests">configurator</a> in a previous blog post.</p><p>We bind mount configuration into containers. We prefer this to baking it into the image. This lets us make emergency hotfixes without having to go through the CI pipeline.</p></section><section><h3 id="database-migrations">Database migrations</h3><p>Next, the installation script runs schema migrations. We check all our migrations into version control and run integration tests on them in CI.</p><p>These migrations form part of the "admin" container. We also use this container to run other Splitgraph instance management tasks.</p><p>Finally, we implement a lot of Splitgraph functionality as PostgreSQL functions in languages like <code>PL/Python</code> or <code>PL/Lua</code>. We package those up as PostgreSQL extensions which we also install at migration time.</p></section><section><h3 id="reloading-services">Reloading services</h3><p>We have several service groups that we deploy one after another. We use <code>./service-runscript.sh up -d</code> to upgrade most of them. This means that Docker Compose only recreates containers for services with changed specifications. You can read more about this behavior in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/">Compose documentation</a>.</p><p>This is not a zero downtime deploy, but we try to minimize excess container restarts by pinning third-party container hashes. For example, instead of <code>haproxy:latest</code>, we use <code>haproxy@sha256:e6f9faf0c2a0cf2d2d5a53307351fa896d...</code>.</p><p>In some cases, we run many copies of the same service group for high availability. This is the case for our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">REST API</a>. There, the script waits until the replica is healthy before upgrading the next one:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>#!/bin/bash -e</span>



<span>CONTAINER</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>


<span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>120</span>
<span>while</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>status</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span>docker inspect -f <span>'{{.State.Health.Status}}'</span> <span>"<span>$CONTAINER</span>"</span><span>)</span></span>
  <span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"<span>$status</span>"</span> <span>!=</span> <span>"starting"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>fi</span>
  <span>if</span> <span><span>((</span> timeout <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>))</span></span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"Timed out waiting for <span>$CONTAINER</span> to become healthy"</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>fi</span>
  <span>sleep</span> <span>2</span>
  <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span><span>$((</span> timeout <span>-</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span></span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for <span>$CONTAINER</span> to become healthy, <span>$timeout</span> s.."</span>
<span>done</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"<span>$status</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"unhealthy"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$CONTAINER</span> is unhealthy!"</span>
  <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fi</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$CONTAINER</span> is healthy."</span>
</code></pre></section><section><h3 id="reloading-configuration">Reloading configuration</h3><p>Most containers don't get recreated or restarted on deploy, which helps us minimize downtime. But what do we do if we need to reload a service's configuration without restarting it?</p><p>The answer is simple. Lots of services like HAProxy, Prometheus, PGBouncer or NGINX support configuration reloads via a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal. You can send a UNIX signal to a container with Docker:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span><span>$</span> <span>docker <span>kill</span> --signal SIGHUP container_name</span></span>
</code></pre><p>All we need to do to apply new configuration is send <code>SIGHUP</code> to relevant containers after a deploy. If the configuration has errors, these services will silently switch back to the old one.</p><p>There's a caveat here with bind mounts. You have to make sure you're bind mounting <strong>the directory</strong> with the configuration file rather than the actual file. This is because of how Docker bind mounts interact with Linux inodes. More on <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15793#issuecomment-135411504" as="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15793#issuecomment-135411504">Docker GitHub</a>.</p></section><section><h3 id="healthchecks-and-monitoring">Healthchecks and monitoring</h3><p>As the final step, the deploy runs <code>docker-compose ps</code> to make sure all containers that have healthchecks pass them. If there are unhealthy containers, the deploy script raises an alert in our team chat.</p><p>We also use <a href="https://prometheus.io/" as="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/" as="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> to scrape various container statistics, plot them and alert on them. In particular, we have alerting rules on:</p><ul><li>HAProxy backend availability</li><li>High HTTP response latencies</li><li>High node resource usage</li><li>High rate of non-2xx responses</li><li>Failed Airflow jobs</li></ul><p>We check our Prometheus configs into version control. We do the same with Grafana dashboards. We load those from configuration files using Grafana's <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/" as="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/">provisioning</a> feature.</p></section></section><section><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we discussed how we use Docker Compose to run Splitgraph in production, as well as how to use it for automated deploys.</p><p>This is the final article in the series that talks about our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/topic/infrastructure">build, test and deploy infrastructure</a>.

Your opinion is purely subjective. You can only imagine how people really react to your landing page or whether they find this or that feature convenient.</p><p>But presuming you’ve gathered the data and decided on one or two metrics you need to increase. How exactly are you going to pick the tasks from the backlog?</p><p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>It’s not a one-time action. Improving even a single metric is long, challenging, and requires commitment. If you need to level up retention, you want to be sure that every issue your team solves will positively impact retention. It’s a waste of time to do the tasks affecting acquisition if it’s not what you require right now. And this is when AARRR becomes your prioritization framework.</p></div><article id="Who-and-What-is-AARRR-Prioritization-for"></article><div><h2>Who and What is AARRR Prioritization for</h2><p>AARRR funnel can be used by both startups and big companies but with different approaches.</p><p>If you are small, use acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue as criteria through which you filter all your ideas and tasks. Create one evaluation board and monitor everything together. In startups, teams mostly do whatever they can so competition for time is high. The distinction between product and marketing blurs—you can activate or retain users with both content newsletters and product notifications. So you want to involve the whole team and decide which of the solutions will work best. AARRR is a powerful growth framework and it’s important to use it collaboratively at the early stages.</p><p>If you are big, you can still use AARRR but at a bigger scale—use each letter as separate evaluation boards. Even when you have dedicated cross-functional teams for each stage of the user behavior, they still need to prioritize their ideas. Create a board for each team in Ducalis and let them find the most valuable solutions inside their scope of influence. In this way:</p><ul role="list"><li>Each team will be able to set their own prioritization criteria that fit their objectives only.</li><li>Anyone in the company will be able to see the top priorities of all teams and sync on the bigger picture of the whole product.</li></ul></div><article id="1.-Transform-AARRR-Metrics-into-Scorecard-Criteria"></article><div><h2>How to Prioritize with AARRR</h2><p>AARRR is functional both as a stand-alone framework and as complementation. We started to prioritize with <a href="https://hello.ducalis.io/rice-score-why-its-no-good-and-you-use-it-wrong" target="_blank">the RICE score</a> but pretty soon added AARRR because RICE on its own isn’t enough.</p><h3>1. Transform AARRR Metrics into Scorecard Criteria</h3><p>Think of them as questions you will ask each time to understand what the feature or task influences. For instance:</p><ul role="list"><li>Acquisition—Will this solution increase the number of people we attract to the website/app?</li><li>Activation—Will this solution increase the number of people who register/install the app/book a demo?</li><li>Retention—Will this solution increase the number of people who regularly use the product?</li><li>Referral—Will this solution increase the number of people who are eager to tell others about the product?</li><li>Revenue—Will this solution increase the number of people who pay for product usage?</li></ul><p>These are generalized examples and we strongly recommend you to put more specific questions and additional description. But if you’re not sure yet how to match them to your product, these are great for a start. You can apply the AARRR template in Ducalis with the ready-made descriptions and use them as they are or customize.</p><figure id="w-node-559a6a8c500e-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f2ef4a7452e242cb7bdeb_GhrVKjWOyPySlxAaD9m1ENAstXP6t9B1gFNK9YKKLYqKLJLRNBU_ts7VlR4UY4xJdZcY9u5WU5cAdF1wRp_5-F2FrS6T2qooQf3CNNOxawmMltLK13_oIqsSllky5qo6fQBcM_8k.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Apply AARRR template in Ducalis with one click</figcaption></figure></div><article id="2.-Decide-on-What-You-Will-Prioritize"></article><div><h3>2. Decide on What You Will Prioritize</h3><p>Generally, AARRR is for measuring your marketing efforts. We also use AARRR for prioritizing feature development. You can use it for both, but you may need to divide the issues by the specificity and clarify the criteria descriptions. In Ducalis, we use two different boards for evaluating feature development tasks and marketing issues. Each of them has some adjusted AARRR criteria.</p><h4>Feature Prioritization</h4><p>For estimating feature ideas and product tasks we use Activation, Retention, and Revenue. In this case they have these descriptions:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Activation</strong>—Solves onboarding problems; Customer gets the value faster; Helps to understand how it works.</li><li><strong>Retention</strong>—Helps to sustain usage frequency. Evaluation must be regular. Helps teams to evaluate on time. It’s important to remind users how many issues they need to evaluate.</li><li><strong>Revenue</strong>—Helps to sell. Easier to make a demo. Customers understand the value. Customers don’t want to buy without it.</li></ul><p>Here we also have two criteria from RICE—Reach and Effort, and two criteria specific for our product—Speed and Collaboration. In Ducalis you can pick criteria from different framework templates and create your custom criteria.</p><figure id="w-node-9d020a5a32d5-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f2f6bab5d18573f5ce834_qJ8VW0rKqUVh4sIQu19s3xeR86x_ib6gpBVt5aKEbgoBfiomdcaeuYTsT0rNB_SEdMzTWCDcX-z1C8o9ySsWuNqTxKh8RPOk7VXJi_m1-s4Yeet5dfaER0K3M41DSUVQmKDnh39t.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>In Ducalis you can change criteria description or score scale to whatever you need</figcaption></figure><h4>Marketing Issues Prioritization</h4><p>For estimating marketing efforts we use two criteria from AARRR—Acquisition and Activation.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Acquisition</strong>—How much traffic to the landing page can we expect from the initiative?<br>0—No traffic. Task with another purpose.<br>1—&gt;100<br>2—100-500 <br>3—500-1000 and higher</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Activation</strong>—How many conversions can we expect from the initiative?<br>0—No conversions. Task with another purpose.&nbsp;<br>1—a few<br>2—about a dozen<br>3—dozens and more</li></ul><p>In this board, we use the RICE’s Effort and custom Analytics and Promotion Price criteria as well.</p><p>Content ideas we prioritize separately. <a href="https://hello.ducalis.io/how-to-prioritize-blog-content-ideas" target="_blank">Read this article</a> to find out how we do that.</p></div><article id="3.-Choosing-the-Focus"></article><div><h3>3. Choosing the Focus</h3><p>Focus is not about limitations or belittling perspectives. It is about the ability to control all the essential factors. If you want to scale, you have to break down all your ideas and tasks into five AARRR metrics and manage their improvements simultaneously. You can’t spend all your time enhancing retention only. You will end up with having nobody to retain because acquisition and activation weren’t working. At the same time, you can’t allow a substantial decline in one of the metrics and may require precise concentration. Growth means constant zooming in and out. It’s controlling everything while tackling subtleties.</p><p>For the most part, you want Acquisitions, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue to be of equal value and have the same weight. And then, when you see that one of them requires more team investments, you increase its weight. Thus tasks with more influence on that metric will skyrocket in the priority list.</p><p>You can play with weights in Ducalis and see how the list of your top priorities changes.</p><figure id="w-node-609620c699e5-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f2ff190fb19716e6bccbe_AARRR%20top%201.png" alt=""></p></figure></div><article id="4.-Highlight-the-Quick-Wins"></article><div><h3>4. Highlight the Quick Wins</h3><p>There is one vital point missing in AARRR—it doesn’t take into account the team’s efforts. Increasing your key metrics is important but you should never forget how much it will cost. Our budgets are not limitless and effort can be by far the most essential part of the prioritization process. To grow faster, you want to find quick wins. Add to the framework a restricting criterion to highlight the cheapest and most valuable solutions.</p><p>Add Effort to AARRR in Ducalis. Decide how you measure it (e.g., development complexity or promotion cost), and give it a negative weight (e.g., -2). You can add several restricting criteria with negative pull.</p></div><article id="5.-Choose-Scores"></article><div><h3>5. Choose Scores</h3><p>Finally, decide on numbers you are going to use for estimation. For example, you can use Fibonacci or Exponential sequences. We use the range from 0 to 3. The scores themselves are not that important as how you explain them. Adding what each score means to the criteria description helps to simplify the estimation, make it more solid and fast. We’ve added MoSCoW method to Ducalis AARRR template:</p><ul role="list"><li>0 - won’t impact</li><li>1 - can impact</li><li>2 - should impact</li><li>3 - must impact</li></ul><p>You can also use the exact numbers as you saw in the description of Acquisition and Activation in the 2nd point.</p><figure id="w-node-3b0f5e341c99-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f3053fb956f5305b16fdf_NZLVjTyisOkhqXPIbHIWSp2IqCpIsDrLsDOS1CA-1BJAGjl1Y9J2rdveVV60FH1nJTUW_x2pN869Fh2hlGzX7WUH0igXKzq2FXASse7pKrttrePfRfmO6n9-1HYMHFbUCHIgHlgh.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>With criteria description and issue full context always at hand, evaluation is convenient and super fast</figcaption></figure></div><article id="6.-Find-Gaps-in-Team-Alignment"></article><div><h3>6.

Case in point: PhysFS.</p></header><p>Loading screens are pretty cool. They let artists showcase some nice art while the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_qehhZUds">intro theme song</a> starts playing. Used well, they can set up the stage for the eventual play by putting the player in the mood. But that’s only a side effect. Their main purpose is to keep the user busy while your game loads and initialize everything it needs to render the main menu, and possibly more. But after the first hundred or so starts, the experience may get old. Especially if that loading bar seems to be stuck forever.</p><p>Our Grand Strategy titles at Paradox have a reputation to not be on the fast side to load up, especially considering that they are not exactly next-gen graphics games with tens of gigabytes of assets. A couple months back, I decided to take a look at how Clausewitz (our internal engine) loads up stuff and what took so long.</p><p>The answer was interesting: most of the time was spent doing nothing. More precisely, either doing nothing by sleeping on a condition, or burning CPU cycles waiting a boolean to become <code>true</code>. We had a locking problem.</p><h2 id="thread-safe-but-not-thread-efficient">Thread safe, but not thread efficient</h2><p>The big lock contention was on file access. Every read, write, open, close or enumerate ended up locking a mutex or spin lock somewhere. And most of it was not even due to our engine.</p><p>To ease up filesystem access, we rely on a 3rd party library called <a href="https://icculus.org/physfs/">PhysicsFS</a>, or PhysFS. It’s a pretty handy way of mounting several directories and archives under the same logical hierarchy and treat it as one, handling things like priority when resolving names which is crucial to support DLCs and user mods properly. It also supports a variety of platforms and archive formats. But it had one fatal flaw: it’s bad at threading. Really bad.</p><p>Some time ago, my predecessors decided to load up the game data from disk with several concurrent threads. While it was probably efficient at the time, today it had become quite the pain, since PhysFS implements thread safety through <em>one</em> global mutex that is locked on all API calls. Meaning one thread doing a <code>read()</code> would block any other trying to either read, open, close or seek a file (be it the same or another one).</p><div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>stateLock</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>     <span>/* protects other PhysFS static state. */</span>

<span>int</span> <span>PHYSFS_close</span><span>(</span><span>PHYSFS_File</span> <span>*</span><span>_handle</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>FileHandle</span> <span>*</span><span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>FileHandle</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>_handle</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>rc</span><span>;</span>

    <span>__PHYSFS_platformGrabMutex</span><span>(</span><span>stateLock</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>PhysFS has been there for quite sometime, and at some point an issue was raised about the thread safety of the API, which was resolved by putting a global mutex or two. While probably good enough at the time, it turns out to be a serious performance killer on a modern machine with 8 cores trying to access the filesystem concurrently. In several cases it turned out to be even slower than processing the same data serially in one thread.</p><h2 id="improving-the-threading-model">Improving the threading model</h2><p>Luckily for me, it had been recently decided that we would embed a modified copy of PhysFS in our engine, which made it easier to tinker with it until I had something satisfactory. While I could probably make those changes public, they would have little chance of being accepted mainstream as is, as one of my first decision was to drop usage of C in favour of C++. Instead, I’ll describe here was I did to make our implementation more friendly to threads.</p><p>As I hinted, the first thing I did was to tweak the build (of course!) to have our local fork of PhysFS compiled by a C++ instead of a C compiler. Our engine is entirely built in C++ and there was little reason for me to keep dealing with C in 2020, especially if locks were involved. For example using macros and gotos instead of RAII to ensure proper unlocking on early returns is pure masochism if you ask me. See for yourself:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>#define GOTO(e, g) do { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_ERRPASS(g) do { goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF(c, e, g) do { if (c) { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); goto g; } } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF_ERRPASS(c, g) do { if (c) { goto g; } } while (0)
#define GOTO_MUTEX(e, m, g) do { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_MUTEX_ERRPASS(m, g) do { __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF_MUTEX(c, e, m, g) do { if (c) { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF_MUTEX_ERRPASS(c, m, g) do { if (c) { __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } } while (0)
</span></code></pre></div></div><p>Once that was done, I was able to put all the API state (a few globals) inside a struct that would only be accessed through a RAII accessor that would lock/unlock on construction and destruction. Then I started checking if that state could be split into several sub-structures with each their locks. This allowed me to have a clearer understanding of the data model and where the contention was.</p><p>As it turned out, about 75% of the locking was done to ensure that the filesystem configuration was not changed during pathname resolution. As PhysFS aggregates several mount points under one root (like UNIX <code>mount</code> does), the API needed to lock the list of mount points to protect against data races should another thread mount or unmount a path at the same time.</p><p>The thing is, mounting or unmounting paths is a rare and specific operation. It is usually set up once when the game starts, and only change at very specific places (for example if the game allows to enable/disable mods on the fly). Almost 100% of the calls to <code>mount()</code> and <code>unmount()</code> are done while no other thread is loading as even with locks it would make the result unpredictable. Locking the whole API for that very rare case made no sense for us.</p><p>To solve this I introduced a <code>freeze_config()</code> call in the PhysFS API that would turn the configuration read-only internally. With proper use of <code>const</code> accessors, it allowed me to bypass locking entirely for read accesses to configuration while the freeze flag was set. Any non-const access to the configuration state in that mode would assert or throw an exception to trap the logic error. Since all access to the configuration singleton was now handled by a RAII accessor, it was easy to handle the change at one single point and have the whole PhysFS code behave like I wanted. This reduced the lock contention on FS access drastically, making threaded code actually run in parallel.</p><p>The next lock I got rid off was the error lock. PhysFS keeps track of errors by having a form of <code>errno</code> per thread which is stored inside a linked list of thread id / error code pairs:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>__PHYSFS_ERRSTATETYPE__</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>tid</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PHYSFS_ErrorCode</span> <span>code</span><span>;</span>
    <span>struct</span> <span>__PHYSFS_ERRSTATETYPE__</span> <span>*</span><span>next</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>ErrState</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>ErrState</span> <span>*</span><span>errorStates</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>errorLock</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>     <span>/* protects error message list.        */</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>The API offers a way to get a description of the last error encountered on this thread. The canonical solution would have been the change the error reporting entirely, as keeping the last error code as internal state is considered bad form today (for good reasons), and instead ensure each API call would return an error code or exception when used. This would have, of course, required to change the whole API <em>and</em> all the callers.</p><p>Instead, I went for a quicker solution that made the last error code be a <code>thread_local</code> static variable inside PhysFS. This allowed me to get rid of most of the error code storage implementation, as there was no more need to handle a manually implemented linked list or lock anything. Unless the library is used in an environment where threads are really tight on thread local storage (which wasn’t my case), I found it to be a simple and elegant enough solution to the problem.</p><h2 id="a-lock-might-hide-another">A lock might hide another</h2><p>A surprise that came out of my new locking mechanism is that some lower bits of the library were not using any form of synchronization and simply relied on the main API lock to protect against data races. The archive file driver, for instance, shared a bunch of data meaning that two concurrent accesses to files in the same archive could result in a race condition.</p><p>Luckily, it turned out that access to those archive I/O handles were done a very few places so I could easily solve the issue by putting a lock at archive level. I would have searched for a more elegant solution if needed, but it turned that this one lock never showed up in the profiler, so I left it as is.</p><p>Still, that illustrated the fact that putting a global lock may lead to a bunch of unseen potential data races which will appear later once that lock is replaced by a more efficient mechanism, requiring changes in cascade throughout the implementation, down to the lowest levels.</p><p>The final lock I had to remove turned out to be on our side, as apparently someone had encountered an issue with PhysFS thread safety in the past on UNIX platforms and had added another spin lock on the call site of the API to address it. With the entire locking inside PhysFS now handled by <code>std::recursive_mutex</code> and <code>std::atomic</code> I could safely remove it.</p><h2 id="cascading-bottlenecks">Cascading bottlenecks</h2><p>As my readers may know, removing a bottleneck somewhere does not always solve the issue. Quite often, it only makes the next one visible. In my case, the biggest one to show itself after I was done was PhysFS was our asset loading system. Since PhysFS used to perform so poorly, there was little point trying to load some assets in parallel, especially back when our main renderer was DirectX 9.</p><p>Graphics API were historically also bad at threading. For example DirectX 9 isn’t thread safe by default, and the “thread-safe” flag just enables a big mutex, exactly like PhysFS does. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-differences">official documentation</a> recommends to not use it and instead do all API call on one thread. It’s one of the reason a lot of games still use a dedicated “rendering” thread to this date. While there are pros to this approach, the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First of all, however, let’s look at the basics of log files, how to obtain them, and what challenges they present. </p><h2><b>What is a log file?</b></h2><p>A log file is a file output contained within a web server that records any request that the server receives. It is useful to investigate log files to see what resources are crawling a website.</p><p>Every time a user or a crawler visits a website, a bunch of recordings is entered into the log file. Log files exist for example for technical auditing, error handling and troubleshooting, but as many SEOs will tell you, they are also extremely useful as part of any thorough and in-depth SEO technical audit. A single page load enters a line for every resource request on that page. So depending on resource calls that is the amount of lines log gets. If browser cache is in use some resources might be loaded locally after initial load.</p><p>The reason behind this is because log files offer webmasters true records of how users, bots, and crawlers interact with a website. Suites such as Search Console and third-party software cannot provide entire or accurate pictures of the entities that interact with a website.</p><h2><b>Anatomy of a log file</b></h2><p>The structure and individual components of a log file depend on a variety of factors, including the type of server in question and other configurations.</p><p>There are, however, common factors found within log files.

How can you get access to log files?</b></h2><p>How you access your log files depends entirely on how your server is set up.&nbsp;</p><p>These days one of the most common ways of getting access logs is getting them from a CDN provider. Like CloudFlare, CloudFront etc. You need to get the logs from the closest endpoint between the server/service serving your content/resources and client. In many cases that is the CDN. If CDN is in use, access logs from the webserver give nearly nothing as it gets hits only if the cache is purged.</p><p>On top, you have web servers. The three most common types of web servers are Apache, NGINX, IIS. Common CDN providers are for example Cloudflare, Sucuri, Kinsta CDN, Netlify CDN and Amazon CloudFront.</p><p>If you have never accessed your server files before, getting to them can be difficult. You will also need to know what type of log you are searching for, such as an error log or an access log.&nbsp;</p><p>Providing detailed explanations of how to access these for each type of server is an article for another day, but below are three official guides to accessing log files on the three different server types:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to access Apache access log files </a>(Linux)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to access NGINX </a><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">access </a><a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">log files</a> (Linux)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to access IIS </a><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">access </a><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">log files</a> (Windows)</p></li></ul><h2><b>What are the challenges in getting the log files?</b></h2><p>Since obtaining server files is a cumbersome task, for those with a lack of experience or technical knowledge, getting them can be excruciatingly difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides this, however, there are also several other reasons that a person may find it challenging to get log files.</p><p>For instance, IIS servers are often used by legacy systems, which can be the case for when larger companies have long-running server contracts with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that webmasters who inherit legacy systems may need to refresh their knowledge of older software.</p><p>Another issue, if you are working with a client, is that the client may not understand or appreciate the importance of log files, which means that they could be hesitant to provide access or to obtain them themselves. Or they might've just simply disabled the logs as unnecessary, which means there is no historical data.</p><p>And logging needs to be enabled.</p><p>Quite often, SEOs will have to go through a myriad of departments or stakeholders to obtain or access more technical information or data.</p><p>These complications can often make log file analysis more difficult and frustrating for SEOs, despite the issues having little or nothing to do with the investigation itself.</p><p>I wanted to explore some of the challenges SEOs faced in obtaining log files, so I asked the Twitter SEO community for their experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s fair to say that the Tweet blew up and I had so many great SEOs respond. Both Giana’s and Lyndon’s tweets pretty much sum up the problems around getting hold of log files.
</p><p>Here is a summary of other issues raised.</p><p><b>1. PII</b> <b>(Personally identifiable information)</b> - PII seems like a big enough concern for many organizations, and it's easy to see why. Recent changes to GDPR and compliance means that businesses are reluctant to deal with anything remotely PII. But log files don’t always carry PII, and it's easy to strip out this information from the logs. So, with the right education, it's possible to convince the development and various stakeholders by highlighting the benefits of using log files.&nbsp;</p><p>A potential solution to this problem is to strip out any non-bot IP addresses as mentioned by Serge. I will show you how to do this easily using BigQuery.</p><p>Charly suggested another interesting point about using GET requests. But, it’s important to remember that Google does use POST requests.</p><u>
</u>
Thomas gave a solid tip about compliance and PII as well.<p><b>2. The format/structure of the logs</b> - The logs come in many different formats/data structures and some use compression to save space. So, when you’re using a tool to do the analysis, software often requires logs to be in a certain structure and charset. This is a pain point and not easy to resolve when we are talking about large file sizes.</p><p>I will show you how to solve this problem (or at least try), further in this article.&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. Log size and storage</b> - This seems like the biggest problem faced by SEOs according to the thread. Numerous people mentioned this.</p><b></b><p><b>4. Convincing clients/companies to allow access to the logfiles</b> - Obtaining access to files is a common problem I’ve noticed across the clients that I have personally worked with, and it takes a lot of effort to convince them that this is worth doing, so I totally agree with some of the comments here.&nbsp;</p><p><b>5. Platform limitations</b> - Some platforms allow easy access to server logs. However, the majority of the platforms have little or no interest in providing access to logs as it rarely is in their scope. In large companies, there are multiple CRMs and accompanying systems; not all the log analyzing tools support every type of platform. </p><p>You can also sometimes overcome these through "Edge SEO", Tag Manager or CDN Workers. Also, access logs are NOT and NEVER will be a platform problem. Nor a CRM. Always is a web server/CDN problem, which is platform agnostic.</p><p>This comment from Chris resonated with me because this entire article is based on this problem I had.&nbsp;</p><p><b>6. Accuracy of the data</b> - Accuracy is not an actual problem. It's there, you just need to have the ability to shift through the noise.</p><p>Even Though this might be a problem for some. But, Doing reverse DNS check on mass is not that difficult and can be completely automated.</p><p>Simon made some incredible points as well. According to his observations, Googlebot is used to do Google shopping validation, and if this is accurate (I believe him), the accuracy of the actual bot visit cannot be determined.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there are no official sources on this it's easy to see why it's a very valid point.</p><p><b>7. CDN</b> - Most websites utilize CDN networks for speed and security. It can be a problem for log collection as assets can be served from different CDNs. Also as I mentioned previously the access logs need to be gathered from the "closest endpoint to the visitor" which is in many cases the CDN. With several pipelines, it is wise to have a normalized stream of logs merged into a single place for analyzing.</p><h2><b>
Why log file analysis is important for SEO?</b></h2><p>There are several benefits for conducting a log file analysis for SEO, and it can provide you with a greater overall picture of how your website is performing and interacting with other entities on the internet.</p><p>For instance, by conducting a thorough and in-depth analysis, you can discover whether your crawl budget is spent efficiently, whether crawlers encounter deadends and bottlenecks, and if there are areas of crawl deficiency.</p><p>From the information gathered from the analysis, you can make the necessary improvements to your site, enabling it to perform better in organic search.</p><h2><b>What are some SEO use cases?</b></h2><p>Let’s take a more in-depth look to see how a log file analysis can be used. This list is not exhaustive, but these are some of the more common use cases for SEOs.</p><ul><li><p>Manage crawl budget</p></li><li><p>Fix status code errors</p></li><li><p>Verify whether your site has switched to the Mobile-First Index</p></li><li><p>Prioritize your crawl</p></li><li><p>Manage your crawl frequency</p></li></ul><h3><b>Analyze crawl budget</b></h3><p>Not to be confused with crawl rate, crawl budget is an established term for the number of pages that a bot is able to crawl across a period of time — which usually stands as a single day.&nbsp;</p><p>The budget applied to a website can depend on many factors, but largely it will depend on the website’s frequency of publishing new and/or updating old content and ease of crawl.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important, therefore, that your crawl budget is spent on the right pages. For instance, if the bot gets bored and leaves your site after around 2,000 pages, you do not want that budget spent on unnecessary areas of your website, such as internal scripts or redirected pages.</p><p>Although crawling is usually controlled through robots.txt files and meta-robots tags, there could still be gaps in your defences that let crawlers through to redundant pages.</p><p>Thankfully, log files will tell you which pages are crawled by search engine bots. If you’re unsure about a particular page, ask yourself whether Google or users will find anything useful from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you find pages that you want to omit …</p></div></div>

            <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Microservices are great architecture for various IT areas. It supports the successes of many organizations, but on the other hand is often subject to quite strong criticism. How to avoid possible problems and properly use the mechanisms provided by microservices?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="the-objectives-of-introducing-microservices">The objectives of introducing microservices</h2><p>We have already mentioned business expectations towards IT in the organization in the <a href="https://www.softax.pl/blog/microservices-strengths-and-weaknesses-part1-small-modules/">first part</a> of the article. Let's remind ourselves – IT is to be able to support the growing number of customers, to keep the solution and data security, support for building new functions – in the field of innovation or integration with partners, and this all while maintaining cost effectiveness.</p><p>Microservices are to be the answer to these expectations. In the first two parts of the article we described the features of this approach. We will now try to address the expected benefits of implementing this architecture. Of course, expectations are different, below we have collected the most frequently mentioned set:</p><ul><li>fast and scalable creation of solutions,</li><li>maintaining high ability to change,</li><li>ability to frequent and fast software deliveries,</li><li>ease of production maintenance,</li><li>efficient use of computing resources,</li><li>matching the requirements of the cloud.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.softax.pl/blog/content/images/2020/06/microservices_objectives-.png" alt="Objectives of microservices introduction"></figure><p>Most of the benefits of microservices are presented in contrast to the opposing monolithic model. Of course, microservices and monolith are not the only two available models of solution architecture. However, in this article we will also sometimes refer to the monolith in order to more clearly present the differences in approaches of both these methodologies.</p><h3 id="do-microservices-really-bring-the-expected-benefits">Do microservices really bring the expected benefits?</h3><p>It depends. In our opinion, the considered architecture allows to achieve the expected benefits, but the naive understanding of microservices, as a division of the solution into small modules, unfortunately does not guarantee it. Many details are important, that only together, properly treated, allow to use the full potential of this technology. We will now try, one by one, to present the individual expectations and consider how to implement the microservices in order to fulfill these objectives as much as possible.</p><h2 id="fast-and-scalable-solution-creation">Fast and scalable solution creation</h2><p>The business always expects the smooth implementation of ordered changes and generally quick delivery of ready-made solutions. It is often the case that changes are forced by the regulatory environment, or the business arrangements of various stakeholders are prolonged and little time is left for actual implementation. By delivering faster and working in parallel we can deliver more.</p><h3 id="do-microservices-allow-to-create-solutions-quickly">Do microservices allow to create solutions quickly?</h3><p>Of course yes. It is very easy to create new modules, and it is also easy to make changes to the existing ones, because they are small and have a focused logic. The use of microservices also allows for parallel work of different teams. Each module is independent, so we have less communication. Smaller than in other methodologies, individual modules are easier to understand, modify, test and implement. Together this means faster delivery, and that is what we wanted.</p><h3 id="can-you-work-quickly-in-monolith-too">Can you work quickly in monolith too?</h3><p>In certain situations, yes. If we are a startup, at the beginning of software development we'll actually see the effects sooner creating a monolith. In a monolith we can get started faster, microservices require more initial investment in the solution architecture and work organization. The situation turns around when we are already a larger and more mature organization and our solution becomes more complicated. Due to the lack of independence of the modules, the development of the monolith slows down: frequent analysis of large business areas is required, regular arrangements are necessary, side effects appear. However, at the beginning of solution development, the monolith has its advantages.</p><h3 id="do-you-always-have-to-create-solutions-quickly">Do you always have to create solutions quickly?</h3><p>The faster the better. Theoretically. But usually it is that by increasing the speed of implementation we lose something. Fast may mean "without proper documentation", "without adequate implementation of cross-cutting concerns", "without full testing" or "without maintaining the consistency of the solution". We don't want that. Such an approach means difficulty in maintaining the ability to change, frequent code duplication and a slowdown in future development. <strong>In general, avoiding documentation is one of the biggest mistakes in system architecture at all.</strong>Insufficient quality of tests means failed implementations and errors visible to the clients.</p><p>Microservices require a lot. While the implementation of changes in this architecture may be very fast, ensuring the appropriate quality of the solution requires a lot of work. The advantage of this approach, however, is the possibility of experimenting with technologies, as well as obtaining quick feedback on the solution, even when it is not yet ready for production lunch.</p><h3 id="what-else-to-watch-out-for">What else to watch out for?</h3><p>Team independence combined with the expected fast pace of delivery may mean that a single module will remain easy to maintain, but the system as a whole will get stuck in its complexity. <strong>In a microservice architecture it is easy to create new modules, but their integration with the entire system is often not straightforward.</strong></p><p>It is worth remembering to watch out for all kinds of "shortcuts". Such as the code reuse of different modules or tight coupling of components (about which we wrote in the <a href="https://www.softax.pl/blog/microservices-strengths-and-weaknesses-part2-module-independence/">second part</a> of the article). Often in the short term this allows to build a solution faster, but reduces the independence of services, and that makes future changes more difficult and prolonged. A solution done "quickly", as an experiment, can stay with us for a long time. Remember about documentation, so that we always have a full understanding of the solution architecture.</p><p>If we want a fast solution creation to be a constant feature of our system, it is also advisable to provide a certain framework for action. That is, for example, certain methods, standard for our solution, for services integration, security mechanisms, tracing or logging.</p><h3 id="scaling-of-software-development">Scaling of software development</h3><p>The division of the application into independent modules also allows more developers to work on it. The principles of loosely coupled microservices help a lot in this. Thanks to them we don't get into problems connected with the accumulation of backlog at the level of single people or teams.</p><p>The rules related to design (especially concerning vertical division of teams) or data independence, combined with automation of manufacturing and implementation processes mean that <strong>microservices respond particularly well to the need to scale software development</strong>.</p><p>It is worth remembering, however, that parallel work of developers is also allowed by modular and layered architecture in general, in particular SOA, and not necessarily only microservices.</p><p>The problem with scaling development, however, occurs in a monolithic solution, if it reaches a certain, more significant size. This model limits the ability of independent teams to work independently – it is necessary to coordinate tasks, deliveries and production implementations. Parallel changes in the same code, implemented by different teams, basically guarantee deployment and maintenance problems.</p><h2 id="maintaining-a-high-ability-to-change">Maintaining a high ability to change</h2><p>Creating solutions quickly, in the long run, would not be possible without maintaining a high ability to change. Such a feature of a solution results from many factors. In our opinion, the most important is the transparency of the solution – i.e. the ease of assesing the structure and operation of our system.</p><h3 id="solution-transparency">Solution transparency</h3><p>The fast creation of new functions, introducing changes and the possibility of parallel work of many teams depends directly on the transparency of our solution. If we do not understand the system and responsibilities of individual modules, it is difficult to make modifications without the risk of errors and side effects. Individual changes can degenerate the system, making it difficult to develop and maintain the solution later on. As the size and scope of functionality increases, this becomes an increasingly serious problem. How can you evaluate microservices in this field? The answer is not clear.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-look-like-in-a-monolith">How does it look like in a monolith?</h3><p>In case of a monolith it is very easy to lose transparency. This is not due to the complexity of the architecture (which in the case of a monolith is generally simple), but to the many unclear relationships, which are a consequence of the lack of independence of various functional modules. The monolith, on a larger scale and after a longer period of development, becomes a set of numerous requirements, correctly or incorrectly implemented. It is difficult to determine the area of any change, the original purpose of various mechanisms found in the code often no one remembers.</p><h3 id="and-the-microservices">And the microservices?</h3><p>Microservices deal with the above problems very well, but the question of complications remains – will a solution with a few hundreds or thousands of separate modules be transparent? Well, not necessarily. <strong>The structure of each module may be clear, but the links between them don't have to be so.</strong> On a larger scale it is a significant cognitive load. So is there anything we can do about it? It depends on the actual system architecture.</p><h3 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h3><p>If the architecture is completely flat (the system as a set of equal services), looking at it, we will not get clear information about which components are used for what and where their responsibility lies. In this case, quite a detailed (and exhaustive) analysis would be necessary.</p><p>The situation will change for the better if we introduce some sort of hierarchy within the set of services. Separating certain functional areas, perhaps in the form of system layers, and assigning individual microservices to them will allow to define special system …</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

                    <p>After starting to use <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2019/12/30/cracking-the-human-memory/">spaced repetition more actively</a> and being <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/05/24/bullet-journaling/">more consistent with my journaling</a>, now I've tackled improving my note taking skills.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've read about various note-taking methods, different approaches and diverse goals for them and they helped me change my perspective on collecting ideas.</p><h2 id="my-previous-approaches-to-taking-notes">My previous approaches to taking notes</h2><p>While I was still in school, I didn't take too good notes. I guess the Romanian educational system is not set up to encourage that kind of critical thinking which leads to taking good notes. In most classes, the teacher would dictate a lesson, I would write that down and then memorize it, without needing to create my own summarized version of the lesson.</p><p>Then I took notes in Google Keep. When it came out, I was impressed by how simple and snappy it was, compared to Evernote for example. I've used it for around 6 years, so I have a lot of notes jotted down there. But Keep doesn't offer good ways to organize notes, having only tags and search. But to search, you have to remember something to look for, so it's almost impossible to find notes which you have forgotten.</p><p>As I've started moving my notes from Keep to Obsidian, I found a lot of old notes which I had totally forgotten about. Some of those notes were ideas I had, but I never followed up on them. Looking back they were good ideas: I know because in the meantime other people have implemented them.</p><h2 id="goals-of-a-note-taking-system">Goals of a note taking system</h2><p>A goal of a note taking system should be to store information, so that your brain can do more fun/useful stuff.</p><p>But another goal is to help you connect ideas, even from different domains. As you read things in books, blogs, or come up with ideas on your own, eventually some of them will be related and can be combined to make something even better. The note taking system should facilitate creating these connections.</p><p>It should also help you process your notes. A note is not a static thing. It's not something you just write down and then never touch again. Almost all ideas will eventually need refining. When you read a book and find something noteworthy, you write some notes, but in time you find that you can reword it better, as you understand things better. For your own ideas, in time you add something; you cut some things, hopefully making them better and then you create something with them.</p><p>Lastly, the note organizing system should help you organize and browse your notes. It should encourage serendipitous rediscovery of forgotten notes. It should help visualize them. It should make it easy to see all notes that are related to a certain note or to a certain topic.</p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Meta: Writing this post in Obsidian.

It's quite new, it was released publicly two months ago and it's not even at version 1.0, but development is progressing quite quickly, with a new version coming out almost weekly.</p><p>Obsidian is built around Markdown files, which means that the notes are portable and won't get stuck in an old program, should the company go out of business. It enhances the Markdown syntax with the some shortcuts for creating connections between pages using <code>[[name of other page]]</code> syntax. You can see for each page what other pages link back to it. There's also a way to embed one file (or part of a file) into another one. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-6.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-6.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The graph view</figcaption></figure><p>One cool looking feature in Obsidian is the graph view, where you can visualize how your notes are connected. This leads to some interesting looking "constellations". </p><p>There are also plugins available. For now, the API is internal, so all the plugins are made by the same company, but they say that once they reach 1.0, they will make the API public. </p><p>Because Obsidian is based on Markdown files, you can store them wherever you want and you can sync them across devices with your favorite syncing tool. So far, I've used GitHub. </p><p>One disadvantage is that it doesn't have a mobile app so far (or a remote interface in general). On one hand, it's not a big issue for me, because my goals for notes require a big screen and a nice keyboard. In practice, I still like to have access to my notes even on the go, so I just use an Android Git client with a Markdown editor. Maybe one day I'll change this to expose my notes as a static website. </p><h2 id="my-note-taking-workflow">My note taking workflow</h2><p>My workflow is inspired by (but only inspired, not fully copied from) the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125?gi=635ef2e210e3">Zettelkasten</a> method of Niklas Luhman, which is the trending note taking framework du jour, sprinkled with ideas from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Tiago Forte</a> and others. When my note-taking workflow grows up, it wants to be like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. </p><p>I have a loose categorization of my notes into folders. I'm not very strict about them and I don't want to spend much time organizing a hierarchy. Some notes also have tags (simply words prefixed with # and Obsidian is smart enough to start a search for them if you click on one). </p><p>Many of my notes don't start their life in Obsidian, but in my bullet journal. When I hear something new, or I read something interesting, often my bullet journal is closer to me, so I jot down the main ideas there. Then, when I get to my computer and I have time I copy it into Obsidian and I flesh out the ideas fully. Then I try to find any other notes that are relevant and add connections to them. </p><p>One thing that I try to do is to make my notes my own. This means that if I read an interesting article, I don't just copy paste the interesting parts, but I actually reword them and write them down as I understood them. This helps both comprehension and retention. </p><p>For certain topics, I create index maps, where I list all the notes that I have related to that topic. So notes belong to multiple index maps, because they are relevant in different areas. </p><p>As I add new notes and create connections between them, I end up revisiting old notes and updating them. Sometimes it's with a negative update (it didn't pan out, it was a wrong idea), but sometimes it's a positive one (a further development or something similar someone else has done). </p><p>The most interesting part is when notes from very different areas start to "touch" each other. Because of the graph view, it's easy to see how close notes are to each other. I also use the graph view to see what notes are isolated and then I try to find them a place. As you can see in the above screenshot, I still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>So far I have added 160 notes in Obsidian, so it's a small knowledge base. I still have many notes in Google Keep to move over. But I feel like Obsidian has already helped me (I feel on top of my notes) and I hope something nice (and useful) will come out of it. </p><p>Top photo by <a href="https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#/media/Bild:Obszidi%C3%A1n(Vezuv)005.jpg">Pogány Péter - Egen Wark</a>.</p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 31.</em></p>

July 28, 2020 | https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/speeding-up-static-websites-with-pjax/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/speeding-up-static-websites-with-pjax/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With the fast-growing trend of static websites, many people are moving their blogs from <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, etc, to static websites built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. And there is a good reason for that. One of the reasons is security, cutting down server costs, ease of maintenance, performances, and many others. But in this article, I would like to focus on performances.</p>
<p>As everybody knows, static websites offer out-of-the-box very fast performances without any configuration. You have no database, no dynamically generated content, just serving HTML files from your hosting. As simple as that. But using the PJAX technique we can improve loading performances and enhance the user’s experience a lot!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pjax-and-how-it-works">What is PJAX and how it works?</h2>
<p>PJAX technique is using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState">PushState</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a>. Basically, on a page request, we will manually update the URL and inject the new content on the page, thus avoiding reloading your page’s layout or any resources (JS, CSS), giving a fast page load.</p>
<p>Here are the steps of the process with <a href="https://barba.js.org/">Barba.js</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the link is valid and eligible for PJAX. If yes, prevent normal browser behavior.</li>
<li>Change the URL using the push state API.</li>
<li>Start fetching the new page via an XMLHttpRequest.</li>
<li>Create a new transition instance.</li>
<li>As soon the new page is loaded, barba.js parses the new HTML (taking .barba-container) and puts the new content on the DOM inside #barba-wrapper.</li>
<li>The transition instance will take care of hiding the old container and showing the new one.</li>
<li>As soon as the transition is finished, the old container is removed from the DOM.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-implement-pjax-on-a-website">How to implement PJAX on a website?</h2>
<p>There are many PJAX libraries, like <a href="https://barba.js.org/">Barba.js</a>, <a href="https://sennajs.com/">Senna.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MoOx/pjax">Pjax</a>, etc. Usually, they all offer extremely easy implementation, I prefer using Barba.js for simple websites and Senna.js for more complex ones as it has a better API. In this article, I will use Barba.js</p>
<p>The implementation consists of 2 parts:
Setting up DOM markup
Script initialization.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-dom-markup">Setting up DOM markup</h3>
<p>Barba.js needs to know how your website is set up, so it will need a few HTML attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>body</span> <span>data-barba</span><span>=</span><span>"wrapper"</span>&gt;
  <span>&lt;!-- put here content that will not change
</span><span>  between your pages, like &lt;header&gt; or &lt;nav&gt; --&gt;</span>

  &lt;<span>main</span> <span>data-barba</span><span>=</span><span>"container"</span>&gt;
    <span>&lt;!-- put here the content you wish to change
</span><span>    between your pages, like your main content &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&gt; --&gt;</span>
  &lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;

  <span>&lt;!-- put here content that will not change
</span><span>  between your pages, like &lt;footer&gt; --&gt;</span>
&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The wrapper is the main Barba section that contains all your page structure and the Barba container.
The container defines a section in which content is updated automatically when you navigate between your pages.</p>
<h3 id="script-initialization">Script initialization</h3>
<p>After setting up the DOM attributes we simply include Barba.js script in the head of the document and initialize the script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"text/javascript"</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@barba/core"</span> <span>async</span> <span>onload</span><span>=</span><span>"barba.init({})"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach will give a SPA-like feeling of the website since there are much fewer server requests.</p>

                <p><span>The illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a growing threat to biodiversity. This trade is becoming one of the most valuable illegal trade sectors. IWT threatens biodiversity and can have a negative impact on the economy. Hiding or laundering IWT revenues undermines financial integrity. Financial criminals facilitate money laundering activities by making billions of dollars of illegal trade in rhino horns, ivory, and other similar wildlife products.</span></p><p><span>  It has published a global report on IWT for the first time by assessing the aspects of money laundering (ML) of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) wildlife crimes and how judicial districts should apply FATF standards to combat IWT. </span></p><h2><b>Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) Relationship With Money Laundering </b></h2><p>   <span>FATF released the June 2020 Money Laundering and the Illegal Wildlife Trade report. The purpose of the <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Money-laundering-and-illegal-wildlife-trade.pdf">FATF report</a> is to provide guidance on measures that can be taken to combat money laundering from the Illegal Wildlife Trade. The Illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a major organized crime that fuels corruption and threatens biodiversity. According to the 2016 UN World Wildlife Crime report, criminals trade products derived from more than 7,000 wild animal and plant species worldwide. Criminals illegally trade not only iconic mammals but also less well-known species such as bird, amphibian species, corals, reptiles, boney fish. A striking example is illegally hunting criminals to make bags and shoes from the skin of pythons, to consume them as food, and to be used as a traditional medical tool.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>FATF defines illegal wildlife trade as a "global threat", which is also linked to other organized crime such as drug trafficking and arms trade. Criminals abuse the official financial industry to hide illegal revenues from wildlife crimes and money laundering. According to the report, an estimated 7 billion to 23 billion dollars of illegal wildlife trade takes place annually. Although making a profit from illegal wildlife trade is one of the most effective ways of money laundering, there is a deficiency in monitoring the financial flows of wildlife smugglers, this means that countries rarely focused on the financial aspect of this crime. Therefore, the criminals continued to expand their activities in this area.</span><span><br></span></p><h2><b>Methods Used for The Illegal Wildlife Trade  </b></h2><p>   <span>All criminals in IWT often use shells and front companies to hide payments and launder the revenues of their illegal activities. They primarily use shell companies to facilitate the transfer of value among the union members of the criminals, between buyers and sellers, or to hold assets. In addition, criminals often use legitimate frontline companies to hide the transfer of value from IWT. On the other hand, criminals use the import-export industries to legally demonstrate the movement of goods and payments across borders. Some of the vulnerable sectors that criminals use to clear your income are breeding facilities, pet shops, zoos, the decor, and the fashion industry. </span></p><p><span>Simply to explain their process, Illegal funds obtained are transferred to third parties via bank transfers through e-banking platforms, loans or payments, licensed money transfer systems, and banks. Third-party accounts also often use innocent bank mules. Their illegal transactions are not noticeable, and thus money laundering takes place. Furthermore, with the development of online markets and mobile, social media-based payments, The Illegal Wildlife Trading has increased.</span><span> </span></p><h2><b>Cooperation in Financial Crimes Related to The Illegal Wildlife Trade </b></h2><p> <span>According to the FATF Recommendation, all jurisdictions require that Illegal Wildlife Trade identify, assess, and take action to reduce the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Moreover, As stated in the FATF report, if criminal offenses related to money laundering caused by Illegal Wildlife Trade abroad occurred in another country, this should definitely constitute a crime. As a result, wildlife crime committed abroad as a basis for money laundering should not only be able to provide international cooperation in cases where double criminality is required but also through domestic investigations and prosecutions. </span></p><p><span> On the other side, Cooperation between the public and private sectors is important for the identification and disruption of IWT related financial flows. Especially in jurisdictions with public-private partnerships, there has been an interaction between the public sector and financial institutions in the monitoring of crimes related to IWT. Collaborations include both strategic and operational information exchange. As a result of the survey conducted by FATF, most of the countries' cooperation in combating IWT-related financial crimes is realized within the financial sector and to a lesser extent among non-financial sectors. </span></p><h2><b>FATF Recommendations in Combating IWT </b></h2><p>   <span>To combat money laundering (ML) and Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT), both high-level political commitment and improved operational cooperation are needed. It is very important to work closely with sectors that play a role in combating money laundering with law enforcement officers responsible for wildlife crime. Studies can improve countries and private sector activities. The role of FATF Standards is very important in combating illegal wildlife trade. </span></p><p><span>   Understanding of IWT's threats to non-financial businesses, different geographic country risk profiles for different species, and asset management practices related to illegal wildlife trade are required. FATF encourages strengthening money laundering risk understandings related to such crimes through comprehensive risk assessments and sharing the results of these efforts with all relevant authorities.  </span><span> </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><br></p>

July 28, 2020 | https://amitness.com/2020/07/checklist/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/2020/07/checklist/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>When developing an NLP model, it’s a standard practice to test how well a model generalizes to unseen examples by evaluating it on a held-out dataset. Suppose we reach our target performance metric of 95% on a held-out dataset and thus deploy the model to production based on this single metric.</p>
<p>But, when real users start using it, the story could be completely different than what our 95% performance metric was saying. Our model might perform poorly even on simple variations of the training text.</p>
<p>In contrast, the field of software engineering uses a suite of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to evaluate all aspects of the product for failures. An application is deployed to production only after passing these rigorous tests.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-software-testing.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118">Ribeiro et al.</a> noticed this gap and took inspiration from software engineering to propose an evaluation methodology for NLP called <strong>“CheckList”</strong>. Their paper won the best overall paper award at ACL 2020.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain the overall concept of CheckList and the various components that it proposes for evaluating NLP models.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-testing">Behavioral Testing</h2>
<p>To understand CheckList, let’s first understand behavioral testing in the context of software engineering.</p>
<p>Behavioral testing, also known as black-box testing, is a method where we test a piece of software based on its expected input and output. We don’t need access to the actual implementation details.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you have a function that adds two numbers together.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can evaluate this function by writing tests to compare it’s output to the expected answer. We are not concerned with how this function was implemented internally.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>test_add</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>3</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Even for a simple function such as addition, there are capabilities that it should satisfy. For example, the addition of a number with zero should yield the original number itself.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Function Signature</th>
<th>Output</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Test Passed</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Two Positive Numbers</strong></td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><strong>Pass Rate</strong></td>
<td><span>4</span>/<span>4</span> = <span>100%</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="checklist-framework">CheckList Framework</h2>
<p>CheckList proposes a general framework for writing behavioral tests for any NLP model and task.</p>
<p>The core idea is based on a conceptual matrix that is composed of <span>linguistic capabilities</span> as rows and <span>test types</span> as columns. The intersecting cells contain multiple test examples generated from templates that we run and calculate the <span>failure rate</span> for.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><span>Capability</span> / <span>Test</span></th>
<th><span>Minimum Functionality Test(MFT)</span></th>
<th><span>Invariance Test(INV)</span></th>
<th><span>Directional Expectation Test(DIR)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>VOCABULARY</span></td>
<td><span>15.0%</span></td>
<td><span>16.2%</span></td>
<td><span>34.6%</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>NER</span></td>
<td><span>0.0%</span></td>
<td><span>20.8%</span></td>

<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>…</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By calculating the failure rates for various test types and capabilities, we can know exactly where our model is weak.</p>
<p>Let’s understand each part of this conceptual matrix in detail now.</p>
<h3 id="1-test-types">1. Test Types</h3>
<p>These are the columns in the previous matrix. There are 3 types of tests proposed in the CheckList framework:</p>
<h4 id="a-minimum-functionality-testmft">a. Minimum Functionality Test(MFT)</h4>
<p>This test is similar to unit tests in software engineering. We create a collection of (text, expected label) pairs and test the model on this collection.</p>
<p>For example, we are testing the negation capability of the model using an MFT test below.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-mft.png" alt=""><br>
Template: I <span>{NEGATION}</span> <span>{POS_VERB}</span> the <span>{THING}</span></p>
<p>The goal of this test is to make sure the model is not taking any shortcuts and possesses linguistic capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="b-invariance-testinv">b. Invariance Test(INV)</h4>
<p>In this test, we perturb the text examples in a way that the label should not change. Then, the model is tested on this perturbed example and the model passes the test only if its prediction remains the same (i.e invariant).</p>
<p>For example, changing the location from Chicago to Dallas should not change the original sentiment of a text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-INV.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can use different perturbation functions to test different capabilities. The paper mentions two examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Perturbation</th>
<th>Invariance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>Change location name in text</td>
<td>Should not change sentiment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robustness</td>
<td>Add typos to the text</td>
<td>Should not change prediction</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="c-directional-expectation-testdir">c. Directional Expectation Test(DIR)</h4>
<p>This test is similar to the invariance test but here we expect the model prediction to change after perturbation.</p>
<p>For example, if we add a text “You are lame” to the end of a text, the expectation is that sentiment of the original text will not move towards a positive direction.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-DIR.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can also write tests where we expect the target label to change. For example, consider the QQP task where we need to detect if two questions are duplicates or not.</p>
<p>If we have a pair of duplicate questions and we change the location in one of the questions, then we expect the model to predict that they are not duplicates.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Predicted</th>
<th>Passed</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>How many people are there in <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>What is the population of <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>Duplicate</td>
<td>Duplicate</td>
<td>✔</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>How many people are there in <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>What is the population of <span>Turkey</span>?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td><span>Duplicate</span></td>
<td><span>X</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="2-linguistic-capabilities">2. Linguistic Capabilities</h3>
<p>These are the rows in the CheckList matrix. Each row contains a specific linguistic capability that applies to most NLP tasks.</p>
<p>Let’s understand examples of capabilities given in the original paper. The authors provide a lot of examples to help us build a mental model of how to test new capabilities relevant to our task and domain.</p>
<h4 id="a-vocabulary-and-pos">a. Vocabulary and POS</h4>
<p>We want to ensure the model has enough vocabulary knowledge and can differentiate words with a different part of speech and how it impacts the task at hand.</p>
<p>For example, the paper shows the 3 test types for a sentiment analysis task.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>The company is Australian</td>
<td>neutral</td>
<td>neutral adjective and nouns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>That cabin crew is <span>extraordinary</span></td>
<td>positive</td>
<td>sentiment-laden adjectives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td><span><del>the</del></span> ⮕ <span>our</span> nightmare continues</td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Replace neutral words with other neutral words</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>AA45… JFK to LAS. <span>You are brilliant</span></td>
<td>move towards +ve</td>
<td>Add positive phrase to end</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>your service sucks. <span>You are lame</span></td>
<td>move towards -ve</td>
<td>Add negative phrase to end</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This can also be applied for the QQP task as shown below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>Is John a teacher?</td>
<td>Is John <span>an accredited</span> teacher?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td>Modifiers change question intent</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="b-named-entity-recognitionner">b. Named Entity Recognition(NER)</h4>
<p>It tests the capability of the model to understand named entities and whether it is important for the current task or not.</p>
<p>We have examples of NER capability tests for sentiment analysis given below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td>We had a safe travel to <span><del>Chicago</del></span> ⮕ <span>Dallas</span></td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Switching locations should not change predictions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td><span><del>Benjamin</del></span> ⮕ <span>Anna</span> was your savior</td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Switching person names should not change predictions</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can also apply this to the QQP task.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>

<tbody>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>Why isn’t Hillary Clinton in jail?</td>
<td>Is <span>Hillary Clinton</span> ⮕ <span>Nicole Perez</span> going to go to jail?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td>Changing name in only one question</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>Why<span>’s</span> Hillary Clinton <span>running</span>?</td>
<td>Is Hillary Clinton going to go to jail?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td>Keep first word and entities, replace everything else with ROBERTA</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="c-temporal">c. Temporal</h4>
<p>Here we want to test if the model understands the order of events in the text.</p>
<p>Below are examples of tests we can devise to evaluate this capability for a sentiment model.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Expected</th>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="d-negation">d. Negation</h4>
<p>This ensures the model understands negation and its impact on the output.</p>
<p>Below are examples of tests we can devise to evaluate negation capabilities for a sentiment model.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>

<p>Example of image cartoonization with our method: left is a frame in the animation "Garden of words", right is a real-world photo processed by our proposed method.</p>

<p>
		This paper presents an approach for image cartooniza- tion. By observing the cartoon painting behavior and consulting artists, we propose to separately identify three white-box representations from images: the surface rep- resentation that contains a smooth surface of cartoon im- ages, the structure representation that refers to the sparse color-blocks and flatten global content in the celluloid style workflow, and the texture representation that reflects high- frequency texture, contours, and details in cartoon im- ages. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework is used to learn the extracted representations and to car- toonize images.
		<br>
		The learning objectives of our method are separately based on each extracted representations, making our frame- work controllable and adjustable. This enables our ap- proach to meet artists’ requirements in different styles and diverse use cases. Qualitative comparisons and quanti- tative analyses, as well as user studies, have been con- ducted to validate the effectiveness of this approach, and our method outperforms previous methods in all compar- isons. Finally, the ablation study demonstrates the influence of each component in our framework.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/an-accountants-guide-to-order-to-cash/">first post</a> in this series, Order to Cash describes the procedure for processing customer orders, applying payments to invoices, and matching payments to the cash received in a company’s bank account.</p>
<p>In this process, cash flows through a number of systems described in detail below.</p>
<p>Accountants perform cash reconciliations to ensure that cash has appropriately gone through these systems for each transaction.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatisaaidcashreconciliationcashreconciliationa">What Is a <a id="cashreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation</a>?</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A cash reconciliation is the process of verifying the completeness of a sale or transaction across the company’s financial systems. Its completion provides assurance for both cash and revenue balances.</p>
<p>Multiple financial systems are involved in a cash reconciliation and generally, cash balances across these systems do not match.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/cash-reconciliation-example.png" alt="cash-reconciliation-example"></p>
<p>We’ll explore cash reconciliations further below, but first we’d like to address a common misconception.</p>
<h5 id="cashreconciliationvsbankreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation vs. Bank Reconciliation</h5>
<p>Cash reconciliations are often misunderstood to be the same thing as bank reconciliations.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accountingcoach.com/bank-reconciliation/explanation">bank reconciliation</a> is the process of matching transaction amounts reported in a bank statement with those recorded in the general ledger. Its purpose is to ensure that the cash balance recorded in the general ledger aligns with the entity’s actual cash balance in the company’s bank account. While companies and banks record the same transactions, the time at which a company records cash in the general ledger often differs from the time at which their bank reports the associated change.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="systemsinvolvedinacashreconciliation">Systems Involved in a Cash Reconciliation</h2>
<p>A cash reconciliation is more complex and comprehensive than a bank reconciliation because it involves a company's entire financial technology stack. Below are the four most common systems involved in a cash reconciliation. They can vary depending on company size, business model, or technological maturity.</p>
<h5 id="billingsystem">Billing System:</h5>
<p>A billing system creates and manages customer invoices that allow customers to pay for their purchases. Cash from billing systems represent how much cash is expected to be collected from sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Aria, Chargebee, Recurly</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="paymentprocessor">Payment Processor:</h5>
<p>A payment processor relays customers’ payment information to a company’s bank and the customers’ banks in order to complete a transaction. It verifies payment legitimacy and provides instructions to banks for fund transfers. Cash from payment processors represent the final cash received by the company’s bank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Stripe, Adyen, Braintree/PayPal, WorldPay</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="companysbank">Company’s Bank:</h5>
<p>A company’s bank collects and deposits the cash from transactions that are successfully processed by payment processors. It is the final system involved in a cash reconciliation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="revenuerecognitionsystem">Revenue Recognition System:</h5>
<p>A revenue recognition system calculates revenue for the current period and liabilities for future deferred revenues. It ingests information from both billing systems and payment processors to perform these calculations according to the company’s arrangements and policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Leapfin, NetSuite ARM, Zuora RevPro</li>
</ul>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Generally, the cash balances across these systems <em>do not match</em>, which is precisely why accounting teams need to perform cash reconciliations.</p>
<p>Common reasons for mismatch across these financial systems include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Currency differences (Transaction currency, local exchange currency, payout currency)</li>
<li>Foreign exchange translations (How an international company translates foreign subsidiary earnings into its reporting currency)</li>
<li>Timing differences (Deposits in transit, time zones, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The simplest way to examine the relationship between cash, revenue, and deferred revenue is to understand the deferred revenue roll forward. A deferred revenue roll forward is a simple calculation that ensures incoming and outgoing activities to the deferred revenue balance are properly accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/deferred-revenue-rollforward-1.png" alt="deferred-revenue-rollforward-1"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First, let’s review deferred revenue itself.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue is a cash payment from a customer for goods or services to be provided in the future. Since the seller’s obligation has not been filled, the cash has not been earned, and the seller records this as a liability on the Balance Sheet via a deferred revenue balance. Deferred revenue is especially common among subscription and SaaS companies, in which payments are made upfront in exchange for service periods in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: On Jan 1, 2020 a customer makes a $120 purchase for a subscription service spanning Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Jan 1</td><td>Cash</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td></td><td>$120</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As the seller completes its obligations over time to earn the revenue, the deferred revenue balance on the Balance Sheet is reduced accordingly by the amount of revenue earned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: The seller recognizes revenue monthly based on the service period of Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020. $120 across 12 months results in revenue of $10 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feb 28</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>March 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And so forth for April 30, May 31, etc...</p>
<p>At month 12 on Dec 31, 2020, the deferred revenue balance will be fully exhausted as the $120 cash payment would be fully recognized.</p>
<p>Check out our previous blog post on <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/revenue-cash-reconciliation-for-subscription-businesses/">Revenue Cash Accounting for Subscription Businesses</a> for more detailed journal entries.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="cashisimportanttodeferredrevenue">Cash is Important to Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>Since cash is an important part of the deferred revenue calculation, cash balance figures must be accurate for deferred revenue to be reliable. Accounting teams can be confident in their revenue figures by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performing cash reconciliations to verify that cash activity in the period is accurate</li>
<li>Comparing the deferred revenue roll forward calculation and deferred revenue balance in the general ledger.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the beginning deferred revenue, cash, and ending deferred revenue balances have been substantiated, then there is reasonable assurance that revenue for the period is also correct.</p>
<p>It may seem simple in this example, but calculating deferred revenue can be quite complicated. Because revenue is derived from sales in both the current and prior periods, companies with high volume of transactions and/or multiple product lines may experience additional difficulty calculating deferred revenue.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/issues/10">some of the statistics</a> we are going to study for this year’s Web Almanac we may end up needing a list of CSS shorthands and their longhands. Now this is typically done by <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">maintaining a data structure by hand</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">guessing based on property name structure</a>. But I knew that if we were going to do it by hand, it’s very easy to miss a few of the less popular ones, and the naming rule where shorthands are a prefix of their longhands <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0155.html">has failed to get standardized</a> and now has even more exceptions than it used to. And even if we do an incredibly thorough job, next year the data structure will be inaccurate, because CSS and its implementations evolve fast. The browser knows what the shorthands are, surely we should be able to get the information from it  …right? Then we could use it directly if this is a client-side library, or in the case of the Almanac, where code needs to be fast because it will run on millions of websites, paste the precomputed result into whatever script we run.</p>



<p>There are essentially two steps for this:</p>



<ol><li>Get a list of all CSS properties</li><li>Figure out how to test if a given property is a shorthand and how to get its longhands if so.</li></ol>



<p>I decided to tell this story in the inverse order. In my exploration, I first focused on figuring out shorthands (2), because I had coded getting a list of properties many times before, but since (1) is useful in its own right (and probably in more use cases), I felt it makes more sense to examine that first.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I’m using <code>document.body</code> instead of a dummy element in these examples, because I like to experiment in <code>about:blank</code>, and it’s just there and because this way you can just copy stuff to the console and try it wherever, even right here while reading this post. However, if you use this as part of code that runs on a real website, it goes without saying that you should create and test things on a dummy element instead!</em></p>



<h2>Getting a list of all CSS properties from the browser</h2>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, this is as simple as <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(document.body.style)</code>. However, in Firefox, this doesn’t work. Why is that? To understand this (and how to work around it), we need to dig a bit deeper.</p>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, <code>element.style</code> is a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration">CSSStyleDeclaration</a></code> instance. In Firefox however, it is a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">CSS2Properties</a></code> instance, which inherits from <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties"><code>CSS2Properties</code></a> is an older interface, defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">the DOM 2 Specification</a>, which is now obsolete. In the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-cssstyledeclaration-interface">current relevant specification</a>, <code>CSS2Properties</code> is gone, and has been merged with <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. However, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290786">Firefox hasn’t caught up yet</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox on the left, Safari on the right. Chrome behaves like Safari.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the properties are on <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>, they are not own properties of <code>element.style</code>, so <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames()</code> fails to return them. However, we can extract the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> instance by using <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto">__proto__</a></code> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf">Object.getPrototypeOf()</a>, and then <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(document.body.style))</code> gives us what we want! </p>



<p>So we can combine the two to get a list of properties regardless of browser:</p>



<pre><code>let properties = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(
	style.hasOwnProperty("background")? 
	style : style.__proto__
);</code></pre>



<p>And then, we just drop non-properties, and de-camelCase:</p>



<pre><code>properties = properties.filter(p =&gt; style[p] === "") // drop functions etc
	.map(prop =&gt; { // de-camelCase
		prop = prop.replace(/[A-Z]/g, function($0) { return '-' + $0.toLowerCase() });

		if (prop.indexOf("webkit-") &gt; -1) {
			prop = "-" + prop;
		}

		return prop;
	});</code></pre>



<p>You can see a <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/eYJodjb?editors=0010">codepen with the result here</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Testing if a property is a shorthand and getting a list of longhands</h2>



<p>The main things to note are:</p>



<ul><li>When you set a shorthand on an element’s inline style, you are essentially setting all its longhands.</li><li><code>element.style</code> is actually array-like, with numerical properties and <code>.length</code> that gives you the number of properties set on it. This means you can use the spread operator on it:</li></ul>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.background = "red";
&gt; [...document.body.style] 
&lt; [
	"background-image", 
	"background-position-x", 
	"background-position-y", 
	"background-size", 
	"background-repeat-x", 
	"background-repeat-y", 
	"background-attachment", 
	"background-origin", 
	"background-clip", 
	"background-color"
]</code></pre>



<p>Interestingly, <code>document.body.style.cssText</code> serializes to <code>background: red</code> and not all the longhands.</p>



<p>There is one exception: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">The <code>all</code> property</a>. In Chrome, it does not quite behave as a shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.all = "inherit";
&gt; [...document.body.style]
&lt; ["all"]</code></pre>



<p>Whereas in Safari and Firefox, it actually returns every single property <em>that is not a shorthand</em>!</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox and Safari expand <code>all</code> to literally all non-shorthand properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is interesting from a trivia point of view, it doesn’t actually matter for our use case, since we don’t typically care about <code>all</code> when constructing a list of shorthands, and if we do we can always add or remove it manually.</p>



<p>So, to recap, we can easily get the longhands of a given shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>function getLonghands(property) {
	let style = document.body.style;
	style[property] = "inherit"; // a value that works in every property
	let ret = [...style];
	style.cssText = ""; // clean up
	return ret;
}</code></pre>



<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>



<p>You can see how all the pieces fit together (and the output!) in <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/gOPEJxz?editors=0010">this codepen</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>How many of these shorthands did you already know? </p>

  <section>
      <p>Core thesis: One coherent narrative of the past 50 years of human civilization progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>We went from a materially scarce society to a materially abundant one; and</li>
<li>from an informationally scarce society to an informationally abundant one.</li>
<li>The challenge of this decade is attention scarcity. Many of the day-to-day used tools and content in social spaces are actively misaligned, and operating on the basis of soaking up attention for monetization. And because the financial engine underlying this is <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/" target="_blank">unbounded</a> (unlike people's honest effort, which is not), on a sufficiently long timespan (such as where we are circa ~2020), this engine eats up everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>To unpack the problem a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"…Tools and tricks that casinos and psychologists and others have used for decades, have been sharpened and personalised and put in your pocket leashes around your brain to tug at you and -yeah I know how dramatic that sounds but nonetheless- it is the explicit goal of many of these systems." "it’s easy to point at the worst of them but.. What’s on my mind a lot is I’m almost more worried about what they’ve done to the whole landscape of attention around them because they’ve become so good at capturing your attention. They’ve upped an evolutionary competition from everything else in the world.</em></li>
<li><em>Everything that survives on human attention all entertainment and media has to evolve better ways at capturing that attention or risk starvation or replacement by a more fit species. The intent is not malicious it’s just blind evolution, which is far more concerning because there’s almost nothing that can be done.</em></li>
<li><em>You’re trying to walk a narrow path through a jungle full of things calling to you and with competition comes specialization: even if you know how to avoid the top predators something less obviously dangerous may get you. The tension traps don’t have to be flashy and fast: some work better with a kind of repetitive dullness because they hook into your mind exactly, or symbiotic species form a little loop that you just circle endlessly going from one to the other to another and back again.</em></li>
<li><em>I worry this is creating an attentionally deficit society that you constantly have a brain tugged at and pulled at is to end up with a brain so used to having its time and attention captured and consumed that even if you step away briefly you’re left with a mind unable to be on its own to be idle to reflect.”</em> Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf2VxeIm1no" target="_blank">CPG Grey: Walk with me</a></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>gwern: "Underuse of System II particularly manifests as over-exploitation/under-exploration, where large potential improvements are foregone because of a lack of a habit or other systematic factor which would trigger exploration. [..] One way to measure under-exploration is noting instances where exogenous randomization or destruction of the status quo option leads to permanent changes or net efficiency gains after the shock is removed, indicating learning or that the status quo was suboptimal all along."</li>
<li>Like with drugs, the issue with these platforms is that they make you feel okay with being bored; while boredom is a trigger for needing to do something more; and these platforms, like a sponge, soak up that extra energy, and redirect it towards hate.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Taxonomy of attention problems:</h2>

<p>Software scaffolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>youtube &amp; wall/feeds selecting for content which maximizes the "engagement" / amount of time you're spending there; at extremes, this happens by driving people to more extremist content, but the algo tends to find it's way around attention barriers</li>
<li>software scaffolds optimizing for drama-maximization. Worst offender here used to be Tumblr, which allowed people to pick-quote specific parts from an overall article, without backlinks, or context present. This created a strong evolutionary pressure for the most anger-inducing pieces to spread, which could then further mutate, and become a super-germ</li>
<li>To a lesser extent, Twitter does the same</li>
</ul>

<p>Culture scaffolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>controversy igniting thought-germs evolution. "If there is some argument that splits the population, and lasts forever, you're looking at a super-successful pair of symbiotic anger germs, that have reached ecological stability" (CGP Grey, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc</a> ) . This is known as the "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731210923/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/" target="_blank">toxoplasma of rage</a>".</li>
<li>people taking offense &amp; offense taking being rewarded, which feeds more anxiety in target group: people "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23640135" target="_blank">sit around looking to be offended to raise their own social value amonst their online peers</a>."</li>
<li>These things can happen naturally, but more often than not are deliberately led by a "lapidation entrepreneur" : <em>"&nbsp;Someone makes a mistake, or a foolish or offensive comment, and lapidators come out in force, often in a state of frenzy. Usually they are led by lapidation entrepreneurs, who have their own agenda. They might be concerned with self-promotion. They might be concerned with promoting a cause or with defeating an opponent, for whom the lapidation victim is taken to stand, or can be made to stand. They may want to make the occasion for lapidation stand for the opponent, so that the opponent, or the cause for which they stand, is that occasion." </em> [ <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3407390" target="_blank">Lapidation and Apology by Cass R. Sunstein</a> ]</li>
</ul>



<h2>Solutions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The general meta-problem with any short-term hacks, is the strong incentive for the memes, and the agents in the system to hack around any published solutions, and so they aren't <a href="https://sdrinf.com/reflection-completeness" target="_blank">reflection-complete</a>: the more people know about them, the less they work. Solutions below therefore fall into categories of: either non-scaleable, hard to reach, or have an incentive that is more aligned with the user</li>
<li>For gathering data on how aligned your infospace is with your own values,&nbsp;KPIs:</li>
<li>"<em>A key metric of mental health is how many of your thoughts are new thoughts (sentences you haven't spoken inside your mind before) vs old thoughts (words that have run through your mind many times).</em>" (by EY)</li>
<li>a good qualitative exercise, is to regularly ask yourself how a piece of content makes you feel. If your first intuitive feeling is anger, you might just be looking at a particularly fit piece of toxoplasma.&nbsp;</li>
<li>a good quantitative exercise is taking snapshots of your monitor every 30 seconds (autoscreen) for a day, or two, then reviewing where you're spending your time on, and deciding whether you're okay with such allocation of your time</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Things which currently work: small communities, where there is a barrier of entry, for enduring connections (iterative, infinite game, as opposed to transient one-shots prominent on large social networks); reputational capital, and knowing eachother for a long periods of time</li>
<li>A leverage point in avoiding toxoplasma, is the bridge people: people who are being rewarded for taking offense, and therefore select for the worst possible behavior of the outgroup. These people act as <em>stressors</em>, specifically triggering ideations of worst-case-scenarios. The fix here is removing these people from your feeds/circles of influence.</li>
<li>participating in non-US communities. There are two angles here: the business models of many US corps can't be made economical in non-US territories, and therefore they don't target these; and for US-specific culture pieces, anything which does show up goes through the great filter of geography -had to be deemed useful enough for other countries to include it in their communities.</li>
<li>Self-hosted systems for anything valuable. Dropbox -&gt; owncloud, filters below</li>
<li>filters, filters everywhere</li>
<li>One of the most promising solution is coming from MIT media labs: <a href="https://gobo.social/" target="_blank">https://gobo.social/</a> which allows you to (transparently) filter your twitter / facebook feeds based on preferences. Imperfect, but directionally correct</li>
<li>For Twitter, I wrote my own filter which uses ML magic to classify individual tweets according to pre-labelled tags.</li>
<li>Software filters, a lot of them. Specifically:</li>
<li>Against advertisement (ublock origin, and it's many extensions)</li>
<li>Against being enrolled into targeting systems (again, ublock to filter out client-side JS tech)</li>
<li>Tampermonkey for overriding site's defaults (eg opting out from dark design patterns)</li>
<li>Site-specific filters: HN keyword filter, reddit enhancement suite, fluffbusting purity</li>
<li>For specific keyword list, see eg <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfNoPolitics/wiki/filters" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfNoPolitics/wiki/filters</a></li>
<li>Mental filters, selecting for reliable/useful information sources:</li>
<li>The best source on this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU" target="_blank">Crash Course: Navigating Digital Information</a> , highly recommended</li>
<li>When evaluating a site/social account:</li>
<li>Who is behind this information? Friends/person/company? &amp; Why are they sharing it? What are the incentives in that content being read?</li>
<li>What is the evidence for their claims? Is it backed up with evidence? Is that evidence from a reliable source?</li>
<li>search for opposite -is there any evidence *against* it?</li>
<li>Lateral reading: Lateral reading: you have to leave the site to understand the site. Read content side-by-side with what others have to say about it. What do other sources say about the organization and its claims?</li>
<li>[ref:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZsaA0w_0z0&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU" target="_blank">The Facts about Fact Checking</a>&nbsp;@ CC]</li>
<li>Being very selective for the communities I participate in. At the very basic level, still-working communities have either very strong moderation, some barrier of entry (payment, knowing about the community in the first place, initial onboarding interview), or more likely all of the above</li>
<li>Aggressively filtering out people who take offense, replicate the toxoplasma of rage, or are otherwise being animated by memes. Specific exercise for this: open fb feed, read until you find a thing which does not improves your life, click on owner (author / group) -click “friend” -&gt; unfollow. Iterate until sanity is restored.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, a bit of activism, which when scaled up to large number of people can actually correct for some of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For persons, the constructive way to nudge into proper behavior is sending them a friendly pm on how to make the conversations more productive: <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening" target="_blank">https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening</a></li>
<li>Corporations sending messages specifically to you are subject to the CAN-SPAM act, and can be …</li></ul></section></article></div>

  <li><a href="#parts">What parts NihAV comprise?</a></li>

</ul>

<h3><a id="intro">What is NihAV?</a></h3>
<p><code>NihAV</code> is an experimental multimedia framework aiming at several goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing a test bed for developing decoders for various formats, preferably not yet reverse engineered;</li>
<li>trying new approaches for conventional multimedia concepts (hence the project name);</li>
<li>making it possible to build some useful tools like a player or transcoder;</li>
<li>…and in a process of doing that obtaining and refining knowledge about multimedia formats and related algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, <code>NihAV</code> is a research framework and its goals do not include either being the fastest, covering all possible formats, or world domination.</p>
<p>Additionally that means that <code>NihAV</code> code is written with emphasis on being clear and more self-containing i.e. avoiding tricks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SWAR</a> where possible, duplicating code if it helps clarity, and not bundling similar functions into one module if they are not very related and used by different codecs from different families (e.g. vector functions from speech codecs). On the other hand if it makes to factor out some common code (e.g. for all H.263-based decoders) it is done in the most codec-agnostic way with clear interface between decoders and common decoding framework and no codec-specific hacks inside that framework.</p>

<h3><a id="why">Why NihAV and not something else?</a></h3>
<p>It should be obvious from the goals that <code>NihAV</code> has different priorities from other frameworks and built on different principles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are no frameworks I could use as a base as they are either too simple and limited (like <code>libquicktime</code>) or too complex and convoluted that cutting it down and de-mangling is more tedious than writing a new framework from scratch (no points for guessing which one I'm talking about). The same is true to some extent for <code>tcvp</code> (it even used its own build system) and it's hard to locate nowadays. (Side note: <code>rust-av</code> had not existed at that time either).</p>
<p>Back in 2015 I stared to work on future <code>NihAV</code> design and even wrote some code (which was discarded later) but that attempt did not last for long since I lost interest in doing anything.</p>
<p>In 2017 I decided to try Rust to see what this language has to offer and the best way to do that is to write a complex project so I restarted <code>NihAV</code> and three years later it has main features implemented along with the support for a significant amount of codecs, some of them were reverse engineered specially for <code>NihAV</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="parts">What parts NihAV comprise?</a></h3>
<p>As a framework <code>NihAV</code> consists of the following crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nihav-core</code> — a core crate containing common interfaces (frame data, codecs, de/muxers and such) plus common utility code like audio and image format conversion or decompression methods support;</li>
<li><code>nihav-codec-support</code> — a crate with auxiliary code useful for developing codecs (testing functionality, DSP, common code for H.263-based decoders and such) and not much else;</li>
<li><code>nihav-commonfmt</code> — a crate with decoders and demuxers for various common formats;</li>
<li><code>nihav-registry</code> — an auxiliary crate with code to detect common container formats, lists of fourccs and codec descriptions;</li>
<li><code>nihav-duck</code>, <code>nihav-game</code>, <code>nihav-indeo</code>, <code>nihav-ms</code>, <code>nihav-qt</code>, <code>nihav-rad</code> and <code>nihav-realmedia</code> — crates with decoders (and demuxers if needed) for a family of formats;</li>
<li><code>nihav-allstuff</code> — a crate that allows registering en/decoders and (de)muxers from the crates mentioned above in single place.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proper architecture overview will be done in another page later.</p>
<p>Additionally there are some tools written mostly to test or demonstrate functionality of the framework. There's <code>nihav-tool</code> for decoding audio and video streams and dumping decoded results into wave file and sequence of images correspondingly. There's <code>nihav-encoder</code> for transcoding media into different format (currently there's just two audio and two video encoders and single AVI muxer, so it serves more like a test bed for those encoders and a working prototype). And there's <code>nihav-player</code>, a buggy and very limited player that is useful only for watching samples to see if they are decoded properly. I plan to write a proper player that has at least basic features like pausing or seeking (or proper sync) but I cannot tell when this will happen.</p>

<h3><a id="use">How can I use it?</a></h3>
<p>As you know there are four software freedoms for a program user as formulated by Richard Stallman:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to demand from the programmer to modify program for your needs, and not compensating for the time and efforts it takes (freedom 4).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think there's an off-by-one error you may be right. RMS has not mentioned the last freedom in the list but nowadays it seems to be the most important one. In theory developers and project are paid in exposure (unless it's a large corporation not willing to admit using your software in public) but since I do not care about that and it's my side project for which I can't dedicate too much time to deal with feature requests or bug reports.</p>
<p>In result <code>NihAV</code> is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GNU AGPL</a> in order to be not so popular and provided as is without any warranty or promise of user support. Nevertheless, if you find some part of it useful I'll be happy to re-license it for you under any other free license (LGPLv2+, MIT, WTFPL, whatever—as long as it does not make new obligations for me) and other people can use it afterwards from your repository while <code>NihAV</code> still remains under AGPL. Manual re-licensing is done just to prevent abusing the system (like “can't you give all of the code under N-clause BSD?”—you're not <code>rust-av</code> as it is the only project to which I can allow that; or in the unlikely case when some project first takes my code and then badmouths it—why should I help it after that?).</p>
<p>For similar reasons the code is hosted at some obscure place instead of GitHub.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the main purpose of <code>NihAV</code> for other people should be providing bits of code of varying usefulness and demonstrating that any idiot can write a complex feature-rich multimedia framework with possible application in real world. I did it after all.</p>

<h3><a id="next">What's next?</a></h3>
<p>I do not like to make plans since they tend to go wrong. Instead of that I prefer to pick whatever I'd prefer to do at random and do that. Here is what I want to do eventually:</p>
<ul>
<li>as I mentioned above, write a player that supports basic features like playing several files in sequence, playing audio-only files, pausing and seeking;</li>
<li>supporting some common lossless formats so I can use it to play most of the music I have (luckily I have not so many MP3s so I can ignore it);</li>
<li>maybe write a limited H.264 decoder (because RV¾, SVQ3 and VP7 were not enough) so I can use the player to watch most of the videos too (even if it's limited to baseline and maybe only 8-bit videos it still does not sound like a pleasant task though);</li>
<li>keep exploring encoding concepts and play with them like trellis encoding or rate distortion; maybe I can write an encoder for VP6 since there is some interest in <em>Red Alert</em> modding community;</li>
<li>reverse engineer some game format or some old exotic codec.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different roads and usually one thing leads to another thing so I cannot predict how <code>NihAV</code> will be developed but I expect it to stay as useless as it is now.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>

  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>

  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>

<p>In this post, we will experiment and observe how keeping
the important regions of an image and masking the rest affects the accuracy of
several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks.</p>

<h2 id="important-pixels-and-where-to-find-them">Important pixels and where to find them</h2>

<p>Explainability in machine learning is an increasingly popular topic - understanding
why certain predictions were made is necessary for humans to trust machine learning models
and deploy them in real-life scenarios.
Several methods have been proposed already, like LIME <a href="#lime">(Ribeiro et al., 2016)</a>
 and KernelSHAP <a href="#NIPS2017_7062">(Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017)</a>, which
allow us to understand which parts of an input was important
for a particular prediction by assigning attribution scores to feature values. These
are model-agnostic methods, meaning that they do not assume anything about the
target model’s architecture or parameters (they are treated as black boxes).</p>

<p>Today we will look at a model-specific method, in particular, Integrated Gradients
<a href="#sundararajan2017axiomatic">(Sundararajan et al., 2017)</a>.
This method is focused on neural networks as it relies on being able to evaluate the gradients
of the model’s output with respect to the input. The goal of Integrated Gradients is to
figure out which pixels in an image contributed most to the neural network’s prediction.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_examples.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 1. Example outputs of Integrated Gradients. The attributions are sharper
compared to simply taking the gradients (source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">arxiv</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So how does Integrated Gradients work? The method involves taking the
input image, the neural network, and some baseline image
(e.g. a black image or random noise) to observe how the model’s prediction changes as we
linearly interpolate between the baseline and input images. In particular, we measure the
gradients at each interval of a linear path between the input and the baseline, then summing
the gradients to find the final attributions per pixel. More formally, Integrated Gradients
are calculated as follows:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation*}

IntegratedGradients_i(x) = \frac{x_i - b_i}{m} \sum_{h=1}^m
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}( b + \frac{h}{m}(x-b) )

\end{equation*}\]

</p><p>This equation finds the attribution value of each pixel $i$ in the input image $x$.
$b$ represents the baseline image, and $m$ is the number of steps between $x$ and $b$,
so $b + \frac{h}{m}(x-b)$ is the interpolation between $x$ and $b$ at step $h$ out of $m$.
We then get the gradient of the model output $f$ at pixel $x_i$ for this interpolated input
($\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$). Finally we evaluate the weighted sum of the gradients at each
interpolation step $h$ to find the Integrated Gradients attribution for each pixel.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_intuition.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 2. An illustration of what Integrated Gradients does.
We start from two points in the image space, the input image and some baseline,
and we calculate the gradients of the network at each point along the way. Summing all
the gradients gives us the Integrated Gradients attributions. Kudos to
<a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/marco-spinaci">Marco Spinaci</a> for sharing the graphic!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Integrated Gradients supports several axioms which are desirable for gradient attribution
methods. While we won’t discuss these in detail, here’s a very brief summary of each:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: if two inputs differ by one pixel and get different predictions, then
that pixel should get a non-zero attribution score.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation invariance</strong>: if two models have the same outputs for every input, then
Integrated Gradients should produce the same attributions for both models, even if they
are implemented differently.</li>
  <li><strong>Completeness</strong>: the attribution scores computed by Integrated Gradients should sum to
the difference between the prediction of the input image and that of the baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do checkout their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">paper</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ankurtaly/Integrated-Gradients/blob/master/icml_slides.pdf">slides</a>
for more details! We will now move onto the experiments.</p>

<p>Here are the steps we take to mask out an image using integrated gradients:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inputs: an image, a model, cut off percentage $p$</li>
  <li>Apply Integrated Gradients on the image</li>
  <li>Create “components” but summing the attribution scores of 3x3 squares</li>
  <li>Select the top $p \%$ of 3x3 squares based on total attribution scores</li>
  <li>Set pixels not in top $p \%$ of components (i.e. the unimportant parts) to zero</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s important to note that, taking the top 50% of gradient attributions does not mean
taking 50% of all pixels. We rely on the PyTorch implementation found
<a href="https://github.com/TianhongDai/integrated-gradient-pytorch">here</a>
for computing Integrated Gradients attributions. We apply this procedure to all
validation images in ImageNet to create a masked dataset. For $p$, we choose a range
of values (90, 70, 50, and 30).</p>

<p>Here are some example images:</p>

  <figcaption>Fig 3. Example images of the masked dataset.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most images are still recognisable when $p=90$ or $p=70$, whereas the objects are
no longer identifiable when $p=30$.</p>

<p>We compare several pre-trained models from PyTorch’s <code>torchvision.models</code> module
(<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">documentation</a>). For these
experiments, we will just compare the top-1 accuracies of each model on the masked datasets.</p>

</figure>

<p>Accuracy deteriorates as $p$ decreases, and at $p=30$ the models are only
slightly better than random guessing. What’s surprising is that, even when we keep the
top 90% of gradient attributions and their respective pixels,
the models’ accuracies drop significantly (more than half for VGG-16!).
The results suggest that these convolutional neural networks require the entirety of
the image in order to reach state-of-the-art accuracy, even if we keep the most important
features.</p>

<p>This got me thinking of another experiment to further test this hypothesis -
what if we deliberately mask out the important regions of an image and test the models’
accuracies? So instead of keep the top 90% of gradient attributions, we keep the bottom
10%. Such a dataset would look like this:</p>

  <figcaption>Fig 4. Instead of keeping the top $p$% of gradients, we mask out the corresponding
pixels.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The lower $p$ is, the more visible the images are as we hide fewer pixels.
Here are the accuracies of each model:</p>

</figure>

<p>As expected, accuracy increases as we decrease $p$. However, when you compare these
results to the first table, something weird is apparent. Take a look at $p=50$.
For the VGG-16 model, when we keep the <em>top</em> 50% of attributions, we get
an accuracy of 0.91%, whereas when we keep the <em>bottom</em> 50% worth of attributions,
we instead get 16.06%! Just to check, I compared images which keep the top 50% of
gradient attributions to images that keep the bottom 50%. One would assume that the
top 50% of gradient attributions and corresponding pixels would yield better visual
clues. Well, here’s the comparison:</p>

<figure>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Top 50% of gradient attributions</th>
      <th>Bottom 50% of gradient attributions</th>

  <figcaption>Fig 5. A comparison of images keeping the top 50% and images
keeping the bottom 50% of gradient attributions</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For some images, keeping the top 50% of gradient attributions indeed carves out
the object itself (e.g. the medieval ship off the coast in the third image from
the left). But it does appear that, for some images, keeping the top 50% removes
too much context to the point where it’s even difficult for a human to identify the objects.
What do you think? As mentioned earlier, taking the top 50% of gradient attributions does not mean
taking 50% of all pixels. Therefore for some images, the top 50% of gradient attributions
may correspond to a smaller proportion of pixels.</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-thoughts">Summary and thoughts</h2>

<p>In this article, we explored Integrated Gradients, a popular way to generate
gradient-based attributions for each pixel, and use it to create datasets where we
mask out important or unimportant regions of pixels. We then experimented with several
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and measured their accuracies on these
datasets. Interestingly, even when keeping the top 90% of gradient attributions and their
corresponding pixels, the top-1 accuracies of these models drop significantly.
Perhaps even more surprising is that keeping
the bottom 50% of gradient attributions gave <em>higher</em> accuracy than keeping the
top 50%.</p>

<p>What conclusions can be made out of these experiments? It’s probably safe to say that
state-of-the-art neural networks require the entirety of the input image in order to
reach high performance. But these results have in fact raised more questions for me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do the bottom half of gradient attributions yield higher accuracy than images
taking the top half?</li>
  <li>What if we train a model from scratch using one of these masked datasets? Or mix
regular images with these masked images? Would this improve model robustness?</li>
  <li>Is there (or should there exist)
some correlation between $p$ and overall accuracy of the model? E.g. if I keep
the top 90% of gradient attributions should I expect at least 90% of the original
accuracy?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions would likely lead to separate investigations for the future. Do reach out
if you have questions, any ideas about the above questions, or want to collaborate!

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>

<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

                        └─<a href="https://austingwalters.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="45363c3631202821682724262e292c222d31052724262e292c222d31">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:amdgpu_bl0.service @2.609s +12ms

<p>In this case, it appears the network manager is the real bottleneck. This is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Enable_NetworkManager_Wait_Online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a>, and can be addressed by disabling the NetworkManager-wait-onine.service. Although, it should be noted this could cause your system to fail to boot, if the network daemons require internet connection (highly unadvised to use such systems on a …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <h2>Intro</h2> <p>&nbsp; I want to examine together with you various types of sort algorithms and the tricks they use to lower the magic O number. I reach the conclusion that high performance algorithms that are labeled as specific to a certain type of data can be made generic or that the generic algorithms aren't really that generic either. I end up proposing a new form of function that can be fed to a sorting function in order to reach better performance than the classic O(n*log(n)). Extra bonus: finding distinct values in a list.</p> <h2>Sorting</h2> <p>&nbsp; But first, what is sorting? Given a list of items that can be compared to one another as lower or higher, return the list in the order from lowest to highest. Since an item can be any type of data record, to define a generic sorting algorithm we need to feed it the rules that make an item lower than another and that is called the comparison function. Let's try an example in Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>  // random function from start to end inclusive
  function rand(start, end) {
    return parseInt(start + Math.random() * (end - start + 1));
  }
  
  // measure time taken by an action and output it in console
  let perfKey = 0;
  function calcPerf(action) {
    const key = perfKey++;
    performance.mark('start_' + key);
    action();
    performance.mark('end_' + key);
    const measure = performance.measure('measure_' + key, 'start_' + key, 'end_' + key);
    console.log('Action took ' + measure.duration);
  }
  
  // change this based on how powerful the computer is
  const size = 10000000;
  // the input is a list of size 'size' containing random values from 1 to 50000
  const input = [];
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    input.push(rand(1, 50000));
  
  // a comparison function between two items a and b
  function comparisonFunction(a, b) {
    if (a &gt; b)
      return 1;
    if (a &lt; b)
      return -1;
    return 0;
  }
  
  const output = [];
  // copy input into output, then sort it using the comparison function
  // same copying method will be used for future code
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
      output.push(input[i]);
    output.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; It's not the crispest code in the world, but it's simple to understand:</p> <ul><li>calcPerf is computing the time it takes for an action to take and logs it to the console</li> <li>start by creating a big array of random numbers as input</li> <li>the array in a result array and sorting it with the default sort function, to which we give the comparison function</li> <li>display the time it took for the operation.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; This takes about 4500 milliseconds on my computer.</p> <p>&nbsp; Focus on the comparison function. It takes two items and returns a number that is -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the first item is smaller, equal or larger than the second. Now let's consider the sorting algorithm itself. How does it work?</p> <p>&nbsp; A naive way to do it would be to find the smallest item in the list, move it to the first position in the array, then continue the process with the rest of the array. This would have a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). If you don't know what the O complexity is, don't worry, it just provides an easy to spell approximation of how the amount of work would increase with the number of items in the input. In this case, 10 million records, squared, would lead to 100 trillion operations! That's not good.</p> <p>&nbsp; Other algorithms are much better, bringing the complexity to O(n*log(n)), so assuming base 10, around 70 million operations. But how do they improve on this? Surely in order to sort all items you must compare them to each other. The explanation is that if a&lt;b and b&lt;c you do not need to compare a to c. And each algorithm tries to get to this in a different way.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, the basic logic of sorting remains the same: compare all items with a subset of the other items.</p> <h2>Partitioning</h2> <p>&nbsp; A very common and recommended sorting algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="sometimes called partition-exchange sort, Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.">QuickSort</a>. I am not going to go through the entire history of sorting algorithms and what they do, you can check that out yourself, but I can focus on the important innovation that QuickSort added: partitioning. The first step in the algorithm is to choose a value out of the list of items, which the algorithm hopes it's as close as possible to the median value and is called a pivot, then arrange the items in two partitions: the ones smaller than the pivot and the ones larger than the pivot. Then it proceeds on doing the same to each partition until the partitions are small enough to be sorted by some other sort algorithm, like insertion sort (used by Chrome by default).</p> <p>&nbsp; Let's try to do this manually in our code, just the very first run of the step, to see if it improves the execution time. Lucky for us, we know that the median is around 25000, as the input we generated contains random numbers from 1 to 50000. So let's copy the values from input into two output arrays, then sort each of them. The sorted result would be reading from the first array, then from the second!</p>  <pre><code>  // two output arrays, one for numbers below 25000, the other for the rest
  const output1 = [];
  const output2 = [];
  const pivot = 25000;
  
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      const val = input[i];
      if (comparisonFunction(val, pivot) &lt; 0)
        output1.push(val);
      else
        output2.push(val);
    }
    // sorting smaller arrays is cheaper
    output1.sort(comparisonFunction);
    output2.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; Now, the performance is slightly better. If we do this several times, the time taken would get even lower. The partitioning of the array by an operation that is essentially O(n) (we just go once through the entire input array) reduces the comparisons that will be made in each partition. If we would use the naive sorting, partitioning would reduce n<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>to n+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(once for each partitioned half), thus n+n<sup>2</sup>/2. Each partitioning almost halves the number of operations!</p> <p>&nbsp; So, how many times can we half the number of operations for? Imagine that we do this with an array of distinct values, from 1 to 10 million. In the end, we would get to partitions of just one element and that means we did a log<sub>2</sub>(n) number of operations and for each we added one n (the partitioning operation). That means that the total number of operations is... n*log(n). Each algorithm gets to this in a different way, but at the core of it there is some sort of partitioning, that b value that makes comparing a and c unnecessary.</p> <p>&nbsp; Note that we treated the sort algorithm as "generic", meaning we fed it a comparison function between any two items, as if we didn't know how to compare numbers. That means we could have used any type of data as long as we knew the rule for comparison between items.</p> <p>&nbsp; There are other types of sorting algorithms that only work on specific types of data, though. Some of them claim a complexity of O(n)! But before we get to them, let's make a short detour.</p> <h3>Distinct values</h3> <p>&nbsp; Another useful operation with lists of items is finding the list of distinct items. From [1,2,2,3] we want to get [1,2,3]. To do this, we often use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure.">trie</a>, a tree-like data structure that is used for quickly finding if a value exists or not in a list. It's the thing used for autocorrect or finding a word in a dictionary. It has an O(log n) complexity in checking if an item exists. So in a list of 10 million items, it would take maybe 20 operations to find the item exists or not. That's amazing! You can see that what it does is partition the list down to the item level.</p> <p>&nbsp; Unfortunately, this only works for numbers and strings and such primitive values. If we want to make it generic, we need to use a function that determines when two items are equal and then we use it to compare to all the other items we found as distinct so far. That makes using a trie impossible.</p> <p>&nbsp; Let me give you an example: we take [1,1,2,3,3,4,5] and we use an externally provided equality function:</p> <ul><li>create an empty output of distinct items</li> <li>take first item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (none)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to output</li> <li>take next item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (1)</li> <li>item is found, so we do nothing</li> <li>...</li> <li>we take the last item (5) and compare with existing items (1,2,3,4)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to the output</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; The number of operations that must be taken is the number of total items multiplied by the average number of distinct items. That means that for a list of already distinct values, the complexity if O(n<sup>2</sup>). Not good! It increases exponentially with the number of items. And we cannot use a trie unless we have some function that would provide us with a distinctive primitive value for an item. So instead of an equality function, a hashing function that would return a number or maybe a string.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, given the knowledge we have so far, we can reduce the complexity of finding distinct items to O(n*log(n))! It's as simple as sorting the items, then going through the list and sending to output an item when different from the one before. One little problem here: we need a comparison function for sorting, not an equality one.</p> <h2>So far</h2> <p>&nbsp; We looked into the basic operations of sorting and finding distinct values. To be generic, one has to be provided with a comparison function, the other with an equality function. However, if we would have a comparison function available, finding distinct generic items would become significantly less complex by using sorting. Sorting is better than exponential comparison because it uses partitioning as an optimization trick.</p> <h2>Breaking the n*log(n) barrier</h2> <p>&nbsp; As I said above, there are algorithms that claim a much better performance than n*log(n). One of them is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.">RadixSort</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstsort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="cache-efficient algorithms for sorting strings.

The only problem with Radix type algorithms is that they only work on numbers or recursively on series of numbers. How do they do that? Well, since we know we have numbers to sort, we can use math to partition the lot …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | A task takes an e and measures performance.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> { measure <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> p } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Profunctor</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p
<span>learn</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Learn</span> $ <span>\</span>(<span>Experience</span> e) task <span>-&gt;</span> foldr (step p) task e
</code></pre></div><p>To <code>machine learn</code>, we change the way a <code>machine</code> does a task, based on learning, measuring whether performance improves, and adopt the new way to do a task if it does.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to improve, given a way to change a task by experience, </span>
<span>--</span>
<span>-- you need to choose the better performace way over an experience set.</span>
<span>improve</span> <span>::</span>
  (<span>Ord</span> (f p), <span>Foldable</span> f, <span>Functor</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p
<span>improve</span> progress es task <span>=</span>
  bool task task' (p' &gt; p)
  <span>where</span>
    task' <span>=</span> change (learn progress) es task
    p <span>=</span> measure task &lt;$&gt; set es
    p' <span>=</span> measure task' &lt;$&gt; set es
</code></pre></div><p>The constraints contained in the above code are mostly based on suggestions from ghc to get a compile, and I didn’t think about them much in drafting. Type constraints provide useful guide-rails for future development of these ideas.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h3>What is the Blueprint?</h3>

<p>The Draft Blueprint ("the Blueprint") is the "first draft" of Plan Bay Area 2050, integrating 25 resilient and equitable strategies from the predecessor <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/2050-plan/horizon">Horizon initiative</a>. The Blueprint is a critical step in the Plan Bay Area 2050 process as the region strives to advance towards the adopted Vision of a more affordable, connected, diverse, healthy and vibrant Bay Area for all.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Input</h3>

<p><strong>Public input is key in the success of the Plan Bay Area 2050 Blueprint, and we want to hear from you in 3 easy steps:</strong></p>

<p>See the list of <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/meetings-and-events#events">upcoming Public Workshops</a> and join us in real time to learn more and share your feedback.</p>

<h3>From <em>Horizon</em> to the Blueprint to the Plan</h3>

<p>Before now, the Horizon Initiative tested strategies against a wide range of external forces, exploring which policies and investments were best prepared for an uncertain future – from rising telecommute levels to economic boom &amp; bust cycles to consumer preference shifts. Creating the Blueprint is a key first step toward creating the Plan itself, and thus the Blueprint planning phase will require iteration and deep engagement of the public, stakeholders and elected officials.</p>

<p>The Plan Bay Area 2050 Draft Blueprint weaves together transportation, housing, economic and environmental strategies, alongside an expanded set of growth geographies, to advance critical climate and equity goals. Designed to accommodate the 1.5 million new homes necessary to house future growth and address overcrowding, as well as 1.4 million new jobs, the Draft Blueprint integrates critical strategies to address our severe and longstanding housing crisis. With infrastructure investments in walking, biking and public transportation – as well as critical sea level protections designed to keep most Bay Area communities from flooding through 2050 – the Draft Blueprint makes meaningful steps towards the adopted Plan Bay Area 2050 Vision.</p>

<p>While still remaining fiscally constrained per federal planning requirements, the Draft Blueprint includes available revenues from Needs and Revenue assessments as well as new regional revenues for transportation, housing, economic development and environmental resilience.</p>

<h3>Highlights of the Draft Blueprint include:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Improving Affordability for All:</strong> The Draft Blueprint reduces the cost burden for housing and transportation, with even greater reductions for low-income residents.</li>
	<li><strong>Expanding Housing Opportunities:</strong> The Draft Blueprint integrates investments to build more than 400,000 new permanently-affordable homes.</li>
	<li><strong>Focusing Growth in Walkable Places:</strong> The Draft Blueprint focuses the majority of new homes and new jobs in walkable communities with frequent transit services.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving Lives and Protecting Communities:</strong> In addition to saving more than 1,500 lives from roadway crashes through 2050, the Draft Blueprint also protects 98 percent of housing units at risk of sea level rise inundation through the year 2050 with new resilient infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Positioning the Region for Robust Economic Growth:</strong> Despite over $200 billion in new taxes in the decades ahead to pay for the bold strategies approved in February 2020, Bay Area businesses are forecasted to rebound robustly.</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>While writing the post on AWS reservations I started thinking if there’s any arbitrage opportunity in the reservations. For example - does it make sense to do a 1 year or 3 year reservation for some instance types of upgrade an instance class to get a better reservation value?</p>

<p>You can do this manually using ec2instances.info which provides a quick way to look at EC2 pricing info although forces you to pick the type of reservations you’re interested in. To speed things up I just ran the <a href="https://github.com/powdahound/ec2instances.info">ec2instances.info script</a> to scrape the data into a JSON with a <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/analyze-ec2instance.info">quick script</a> to extract the relevant details into a CSV file. After that, it was as simple as loading into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5H3vsZluk1_TGGMGrZq-KFiha-Bfhu4OBzyp5QynA8/edit#gid=0">Google sheets</a> for some analysis and visualization.</p>

<p>There are a few surprises - the biggest was how much of a variance there is by instance type. The smallest discount comes with the 1 year convertible, no up front payment option and ranges from around 21% for the i3en series but goes up to 49% for the i2 series. I’m sure most of this is a function of the age and demand for the types but it’s worth auditing use cases to see whether you get more bang for the buck on a slightly older instance. The same pattern holds when you look at the 3 year full up front payment options. The i2 series gets you a 75% discount while the discount on the i3en series climbs to 62%.</p>

<p>Another interesting analysis is to compare the cheapest reserved option (1 year convertible, no upfront) with the most expensive (3 year standard, full upfront) to check out the outliers. As expected, they’re strongly correlated but you do so see variance - for example the p2 and p3 series have a similar discount for the 1 year term term but the p2 gets you a 10% larger discount than the p3 for the 3 year term.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"> 



<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  In the history of shortwave receivers, the Wadley loop played an
  important role. It was invented by the South African engineer Trevor
  Wadley in 1946 and it was applied in professional shortwave receivers
  from Racal in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s it was popular in
  amateur shortwave receivers until it gave way to PLL synthesizer
  circuits.

</p><p>
  It is a very clever circuit that made it possible to construct
  shortwave receivers that covered the entire HF spectrum with good
  image rejection, good dial accuracy and good frequency stability
  (adequate for SSB). Circuit complexity and cost were modest compared
  to other receiver designs that met the same requirements.

</p><p>
  The Wadley loop utilizes two tuning knobs that tune two different
  continuously variable frequency oscillators (VFOs). The first tuning
  knob tunes to the required megahertz band from 0 to 29. Though it
  controls a continuously variable oscillator, it appears to act as a
  band switch. Due to drift cancelation, any deviation from an integer
  multiple of 1MHz is canceled out. The second tuning knob tunes to
  the exact frequency within one megahertz band.
 
  
</p><h2>History of shortwave receivers</h2>

<p>
  The very first shortwave receivers used regenerative circuits. They
  typically had one or more RF amplifiers (vacuum tubes) with tuned
  circuits between them. All of these tuned circuits were tuned to the
  received frequency. This is called a TRF (Tuned Radio Frequency)
  receiver. The final RF amplification tube had positive feedback,
  such that it nearly oscillated but not quite. This provided much
  gain and selectivity, but setting the feedback level just right was
  critical. Too much and the circuit would oscillate. Satisfactory
  results could already be had with just the regenerative tube without
  any other amplifiers before it. But if you made such receiver to
  oscillate, the whole neighborhood would be treated to a howling
  sound. This was a problem especially in the normal broadcast bands
  (mediumwave and in Europe also longwave).

</p><p>
  After 1930, the superheterodyne receiver would be used nearly
  universally.  It would provide uniform and good nearby selectivity
  across the tuning range, something a TRF receiver could not do. Plus
  that you did not treat the whole neighborhood to a howling sound if
  you did not know how to tune properly. In a superheterodyne
  receiver, a variable oscillator is used to mix the received signal
  to a fixed frequency, the Intermediate Frequency of IF. Further
  amplification and filtering is performed at that fixed frequency. By
  varying the oscillator frequency you tune to a different station. As
  the oscillator is at a frequency different from the received
  frequency and the signal is not very close to the antenna
  input. radiation from the local oscillator is typically not a
  problem for the neighbors.
  
</p><p>
  Around World War 2, even professional communications receivers were
  still standard superheterodynes. They may have used a higher than
  standard IF and an extra tuned RF stage to improve image rejection,
  but the basic system was the same.

</p><p>
  In the 1950s and 1960s many professional communications receivers
  would use double conversion (two different IF frequencies). Further
  they would use one carefully calibrated Variable Frequency
  Oscillator (VFO) and mix its output with numerous different crystal
  frequencies to obtain the local oscillator signal for all bands.
  This way the VFO could have only one tuning range at a comparatively
  low frequency, so its stability and dial accuracy could be good
  enough for SSB and RTTY. Double conversion for these receivers still
  meant IF frequencies of 1 to 3MHz, certainly not 40MHz or higher.

</p><p>
  For example the German Rohde &amp; Schwarz EK07 receiver of the 1960s
  has a first IF of 3.3MHz (for the higher bands) and it has a VFO at
  a 3.4-6.4MHz, a 3MHz wide range. To obtain the required
  stability and dial accuracy for such a comparatively wide range it
  relied heavily on mechanical precision engineering, rather than clever
  circuit design.
   
</p><p>
  One brand of professional communications receivers however, used
  the Wadley loop. This brand was Racal, producer of the famous RA17
  receivers.  And yes, it does use a first IF of around 40MHz, hence it
  does not require special treatment of the lower bands (which would
  need single conversion if the first IF was lower). Now the RA17 did
  use mechanical precision engineering for the VFO, but the
  requirements were less strict than for the EK07 (having only a third
  of the tuning range). And the number of switches and band-dependent
  filters was drastically reduced compared to the EK07.

</p><p>
  In 1973 the same Wadley loop was introduced in a consumer grade
  receiver, the Barlow Wadley XCR30. Although its performance was much
  less than that of the Racal, it cost only a small fraction (around
  1/25th of price of the Racal). Its performance was much better than
  that of any general coverage receivers you could buy in this price
  range. The Yaesu FRG-7 was introduced in 1977 and it performed
  considerably better than the Barlow Wadley. 
  
</p><p>
  The Wadley loop had its limitations though and in the 1970s,
  professional communications receivers moved to PLL synthesizers to
  generate their tunable local oscillator signals to mix the received
  signal to a high first IF. Amateur receivers followed suit after
  1980. In the meantime there were some very interesting designs that
  combined a VFO (tuning a 1MHz wide range) with a PLL synthesizer to
  generate 1MHz multiples. This system was used by the Kenwood R1000
  and Yaesu FRG-7700.

</p><p>
  Modern receivers use direct digital synthesis (DDS) instead of (or
  combined with) PLL synthesizers. In the 1990s some high end
  communications receivers digitized the final IF signal and did the
  IF filtering and demodulation digitally in a DSP (digital signal
  processor). This technique is now commonplace, even in cheap
  receivers. Instead of a dedicated DSP chip one can use the power of a
  modern personal computer to do the job. There is now a trend to use
  a low first (and only) intermediate frequency, typically less than
  48kHz, in the range of normal sound cards. To suppress the image
  frequency, one can use two mixers and two AD converters, each fed by
  oscillator signals of the same frequency and 90 degrees apart. This
  is called quadrature mixing.

</p><p>
  As of 2016 it is now even possible to directly digitize the entire HF
  spectrum from 0 to 30MHz and do all further processing in a
  computer. No more mixers, no more image frequencies (but you still
  need good anti-aliasing filters).

  
</p><h2>The superheterodyne receiver</h2>

<p>
Let's start with an ordinary superheterodyne circuit for a standard
LW/MW radio, whose diagram is shown below. Such radios were made from
the 1930s to the 1990s. The received signal (either in the longwave
range 150-350kHz or in the mediumwave range 530-1620kHz) is fed
through a preselector, typically a parallel resonant LC circuit of a
fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The coil could be wound on a
ferrite bar, so the coil itself would act as an antenna. The received
signal is mixed with a variable oscillator to obtain the desired 455kHz
intermediate frequency. The oscillator also contains a resonant LC
circuit containing a fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The
variable capacitor is typically a dual variable capacitor where both
capacitors are on a single shaft so they are varied both by rotating
the shaft. Both the preselector and the oscillator have two tuning
ranges. The coils for both ranges can be switched using a band switch.

</p><p>
<img src="https://lennartb.home.xs4all.nl/radio/superhet.svg" width="1000" alt="Block diagram of a superheterodyne receiver">

</p><p>
The 455kHz IF signal is fed through a series of narrow band filters
and amplifiers. The filters select the 455kHz signal with a well
defined bandwidth (around 10kHz in an AM broadcast receiver). The
amplified signal is then demodulated using a diode detector. The
demodulated signal is further amplified and fed to a speaker.

</p><p>
In traditional radios these filters were constructed from transformers
and capacitors. In more modern radios you would find ceramic
resonators. Communications receivers would contain several ceramic
filters with different bandwidths, that can be
selected. Communications receivers would also contain a BFO, a Beat
Frequency Oscillator that oscillates near the 455kHz IF. The diode
detector could then be replaced by a product detector, which is
basically another mixer.

</p><p>
Finally we would have an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit. The
amplified IF signal is detected by another diode and then smoothed
using a much larger capacitor to eliminate all modulation and just
retain the carrier level. This signal is used to control (reduce) the
gain of the IF amplifiers. This reduces the effect of fading and it
reduces the difference in audio level between strong and weak
stations.

  
</p><h2>Problems with the superheterodyne for shortwave</h2>

<p>
  The standard superheterodyne works surprisingly well for mediumwave
  and longwave. But if we move on to shortwave, we will run into the
  problem of image frequencies. In a superheterodyne circuit, two
  frequencies will mix to the desired IF (f1) if you tune the
  oscillator to a given frequency f2. f2+f1 and f2-f1. So if you tune
  the oscillator to 1455kHz and the IF is 455kHz, both an input signal
  of 1000kHz (f2-f1) and an input signal of 1910kHz (f1+f2) will mix
  to the IF. We do have a tunable preselector and 1910kHz (unwanted) is far
  removed from 1000kHz (wanted), so there will be no problem.

</p><p>
  But on shortwave the situation is different. If you tune to
  15100kHz, the image frequency is at 16010kHz, well within the range
  of a single resonant LC circuit used a a preselector.

</p><p>
  There are two straightforward ways to reduce the
  problem. Professional shortwave receivers of the 1940s would
  typically use both methods combined:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Add preselection. A straightforward way to do it is …</li></ul></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>
<h3 id="statements">Statements<a id="statements"></a><a href="#statements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b24d8c1e40edf6fd7e9d768ba8f0df279cd41f0e.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Simon’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a contrived problem which is called Simon’s problem. Compared to one of the other quantum computing algorithms, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, which only requires to run once, Simon’s algorithm requires to run the algorithm multiple times, yet it is still able to solve Simon’s problem exponentially faster asymptotically running on quantum circuits than the best conventional probabilistic algorithm running on classical circuits.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Simon’s problem and Simon’s algorithm in details.</p>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Most of the important properties of Hadamard operator have been derived in the prerequisites section of my previous blog post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. Unlike Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm is only going to use a small fraction of the Hadamard operator properties that Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has used. I would just copy the properties useful for Simon’s algorithm algorithm. For the derivation, proof, and other properties of Hadamard operator, the reader should refer to my previous blog post.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Specifically, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="simons-problem">Simon’s Problem</h3>

<p>Simon’s problem is defined as the follows. Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, we are further assured that there exists a hidden binary string $\mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}^n$, such that, for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$,</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is (bit-wise) $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>



<p>Our goal is to find out what $\mathbf{c}$ is.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-properties">Mapping Properties</h4>

<p>There are some properties of the mapping $f$. $f$ is either a one-to-one or two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a one-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ and $f$ is not a one-to-one mapping, there must exists $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a one-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a two-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, for any $\mathbf{x}$, we must have $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. So $f$ is at least a two-to-one mapping. Assuming there exists a tuple of $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(\mathbf{z})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$. But $\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ so we have $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{y}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a two-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="trivial-solution">Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Solving Simon’s problem could be trivial.</p>



<p>If we happen to know any $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y}$. This is because,</p>



<p>If we have checked all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$ and found there are no $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>So the trivial solution for solving Simon’s problem is to evaluate $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one, and check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations.</p>

<h4 id="asymptotic-complexity-for-trivial-solution">Asymptotic Complexity for Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Using hashing, we should be able to check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations in $O(1)$. However, most of the computational cost comes from evaluating $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, if we are extremely lucky and the first two evaluated values $f(\mathbf{x}_0) = f(\mathbf{x}_1)$, then we are done and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x}_0 \oplus \mathbf{x}_1$. However, in the worst scenario, we would have to have evaluate $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, we would know it after evaluating $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ by realizing that there are no two evaluated values are the same.</p>



<p>Therefore, using the trivial solution, in the worst scenario, we would have to run the evaluation $2^{n-1} + 1$ times to determine the value of $\mathbf{c}$.</p>



<p>So the question is, can we do better?</p>

<p>Similar to the quantum gates we used for the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> and the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, the black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$.</p>

</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, for $\mathbf{x} \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \{0, 1\}^n$. When $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{0} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| \mathbf{y} \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is not necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{y} \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check if we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions and $U_f$.</p>



<p>We have the following quantum circus. Let’s compute the each of the quantum states in the circus. The mathematics is actually much easier compared to the ones in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>.</p>

</div>









<p>Suppose $\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{x}_1 \oplus \mathbf{c}$, and we also have $\mathbf{x}_1 = \mathbf{x}_2 \oplus \mathbf{c}$. Because</p>







<p>We could further rearrange $|\varphi_3\rangle $,</p>



<p>Note that $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle$ is a binary value. When $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle = 1$, $\sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \frac{(-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x} \rangle} \big( 1 + (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle} \big) }{2} = 0$, which means that for the top output qubits, we have exact zero probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$. We could only observe $\mathbf{z}$ whose $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$ for the top output qubits.</p>



<p>Statistically, when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$, for all $\mathbf{z} \in \{0,1\}^2$. This means all $\mathbf{z}$ are possible to be observed from the top output qubits. So what is the probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$, $p(\mathbf{z})$? Is it uniformly distributed?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} = 0$ and $f$ is an one-to-one mapping, we have</p>









<p>So when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $p(\mathbf{z})$ is a uniform distribution and $p(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{2^n}$.</p>



<p>How about when $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$ and $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The deep ocean is one of the most challenging places for any animal to live. Creatures that live in the deep ocean cope with high water pressures, cold temperatures, food scarcity, and a lack of sunlight. There are <a href="http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/ocean-layers.html">three “zones”</a> of the ocean, which are defined by how much sunlight they get. Sea water scatters and absorbs light, so the deeper you go, the darker it becomes. The surface zone is referred to as the “sunlight zone”. This is where most marine species live, and where plankton, kelp, and algae are able to photosynthesize. At about 650 feet, a fish will enter what is known as the “twilight zone”, where sunlight rapidly decreases with depth. At 3,300 feet down, in the “midnight zone”, there is no light other than the light that animals themselves create.</p>

<p>A big problem that fish in the twilight zone face is how to camouflage themselves. With low levels of sunlight coming from above and no light source below them, the fish appear as obvious silhouettes to predators swimming below and make for easy meals. However there are certain fish families, such as dragonfish, lanternfish, and hatchetfish, which use <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZWWyimUGI">counter-</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZWWyimUGI"><em>illumination</em></a> to camouflage themselves from predators below.</p>

<p>Counter-illumination is when an animal emits light from its underside to avoid being seen from below. Fish that are able to counter-illuminate have special organs called photophores on their bottom half, or ventral side, to create light. They create this light either through a chemical reaction, or through a<em> symbiotic relationship</em> with bacteria that live within the photophore.</p>
<p>But how do fish know how bright their photophores should be? Just like on land, light in the ocean fluctuates based on factors like the weather and what time of day it is. These fish can adjust the strength of the light produced by their photophores to match the intensity of the light coming from above them, but most fish have forward facing eyes, so there is no way for them to see the light they are producing on the ventral side of their body. Davis and co-authors aimed to solve this mystery by looking at photophores found on the faces of these deep sea fish.</p>
<p><strong>What did they find?</strong></p>
<p>Davis and co-authors used 21 fish that were collected and preserved on research cruises between 2009 and 2017 from the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 15 preserved specimens that they borrowed from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. They targeted specific species that had photophores around their eyes, but did not use the photophores on their face as a “search light”. Species that used photophores as a search light use the light they produce as a flashlight to attract and hunt prey, like the angler fish from Finding Nemo.</p>
<div id="attachment_27368"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27368" src="https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=422%2C364&amp;ssl=1" alt="Three images of fish in the Davis et al. study.

Arrows show the direction of light from the photophores, moving towards the fish’s eyes.</p></div>
<p>Once they had collected and described these fish and their relationship to one another, they looked at the direction in which the photophores were facing using a microscope and a miniature version of a CT scan. They found photophores that faced the fish’s eyes in all of the species that had photophores used for camouflage. All of these eye facing photophores were also surrounded by a layer of melanin, the same pigment that is responsible for determining the color of human skin and hair color. This layer of melanin focused the light from the photophores towards the fish’s eyes. In some of the fish species the eye had adapted to have a special opening in its lens, called the <em>aphakic gap</em>, which was lined up with the light produced by their photophores.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that fish that had eye facing photophores used them as a calibration tool to match the intensity of the light around them. They used this specialized photophore as a proxy for the brightness of their ventral photophores, and then were able to adjust the light they were producing to eliminate their silhouettes.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong></p>
<p>This research is a great example of how scientists use <em><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/science-magazines/biology-comparative-morphology-studies-structure-and-function">morphology</a></em>, or the form of an animal, to see how it is related to other animals and how its body has evolved over time. Davis and co- authors were able to construe that these two traits, having photophores on their bellies and photophores facing their eyes, evolved dependently. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIEoO5KdPvg">Dependent trait evolution </a></em><em>&nbsp;</em>occurs when two traits that are tied to each other evolve at the same time. Because the photophores on the face of the fish determined how they were able to control their counter-illumination, and better counter-illumination led to better camouflage, fish that evolved to have both of these traits had a greater chance of survival and a greater opportunity to reproduce to pass down those traits to their offspring.</p>

        <div>
                        
            
            
<p>The past few years have seen many different SaaS apps pop up and appeal to businesses. From CDPs to AI, to session replay, there have been many different advanced platforms marketers can add to their toolbelts. One of my personal favorite tools over the past few years has been FullStory. FullStory is a session replay web app that allows site owners to literally watch what a user does on their website – in full video. Previously martech folks were stuck with heat mapping software like Kissmetrics and HotJar – and even to a lesser extent Google Analytics. While these tools were certainly helpful in addressing which parts of a web page were clicked on or interacted with the most, they were static interpretations of the data. </p>



<div><p>Tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clicktale.com/" target="_blank">Clicktale </a>take these one step further and actually provide real-time playback of what a user is doing on a website. This is also possible across sessions and even can follow a user from signup all the way through onboarding – it’s really up to you. At first glance, this seems like a godsend. The ability to actually watch what people do on your site – where they get stuck or what they’re reading when they ultimately convert or exit is one of the more powerful funnel optimization tools to come out in the past decade. I personally can attest to their efficacy. They helped me drop a SaaS CAC from $1,250 to $100 in 3 months. </p><p>There are many other instances in which I have gone into a business, implemented one of these tools, and improved conversion rates by an order of magnitude in a fraction of the time it used to take. In just a few days of watching sessions it is possible to tell:</p></div>



<ul><li>What is preventing users from converting</li><li>Where are customers losing interest in the page</li><li>Why people are dropping out of the checkout process</li><li>What content users focus in on and what they skim past</li><li>What part of the site or app crashed and how did it happen</li></ul>



<p>These are all incredibly powerful insights in the hands of a skilled marketer, so what gives? Why doesn’t everyone secretly record their users and optimize based on the data? First, its helpful to understand what session replay is, and what it isn’t…</p>



<h2>What EXACTLY is Session Replay?</h2>



<p>Session Replay is precisely what it sounds like – the ability for the site owner, or someone else, to replay the session a specific user experienced while on the site. It includes scroll activity, mouse activity, clicks, swipes, taps, and just about any other action you can think of on a website. It has a lot of other names but session replay is generally the widely accepted term that these SaaS platforms use themselves.</p>



<p>It lets you see EXACTLY where someone gets stuck so that you can design a way to fix it and reduce the friction within whatever action you’re trying to get a user to take. It can also let you remotely diagnose speed or loading issues for customers – taking it one step beyond tools like Lighthouse. Being able to see specifically which files load slowly in the real world and on real users’ devices is amazing from an optimization standpoint.</p>



<p>With that being said, these tools themselves carry a pretty heavy payload and can slow down your site by a double-digit percentage on their own. On their own they are not enough to improve the efficacy of your site or app – they need to be wielded by a scrappy marketer who can identify the issues and implement solutions to solve them. </p>



<h2>Visionary or Voyeur?</h2>



<p>While periodically I feel like a voyeur when using these tools, I do see the benefits and generally feel they outweigh the privacy concerns. In my experience the friction in implementing these tools generally comes from the engineering team who feels like they infringe on privacy rights. Are they right? Well, sort of. Out of the box these tools have the ability to record usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. That is where the implementation of the tool, both from a tech standpoint and from a configuration standpoint within the platform comes into play.  It is easy to block certain fields from recording into these tools, but generally, it has to be done manually.</p>



<p>FullStory blocks password and CC number by default but those can both be disabled by a less than honest marketer in order to get additional information about a customer. While I have never seen or heard that happening myself, it is certainly possible as these tools don’t require the obfuscation of some of the more sensitive data. </p>



<p>Some point to the feeling of “big brother” watching your users browse around on the website. Which is kind of what it is doing, but the blind spot here is that the marketer (me) generally doesn’t care who the user is – they just want to know what is getting in the way of the conversion, something session replay does better than any other tool out there at the moment. If the dataset were wiped of any personally identifiable information, it would still be useful to watch anonymized sessions move through a funnel and pinpoint friction.</p>



<div><p>Technically you’re also supposed to list the fact that you are using these types of programs within your Privacy Policy or EULA, and you’re even supposed to be able to toggle the script on or off within a “cookie bar” in order to totally comply with today’s regulations but I have yet to see that actually happen.</p><p>Additionally, who knows what these companies are doing with the data they have? Could they be mining it only to sell advice on optimizing funnels to the highest bidder? It really does allow for a lot of data and PII to cross into the unknown. How can someone even opt-out of this data collection if they wanted to? </p></div>



<h2>Are They Worth Using?</h2>



<p>The short answer is yes. On the surface you cant find a much more effective tool at optimizing the behavior on your website. The magic combo would be to combine session replay with a CRO tool like Optimizely or VWO to identify issues and then implement tests to counter them.</p>



<p>The longer answer depends on your conscious. In a time where people are increasingly worried about identity theft, facial recognition, and giving too much data to big tech companies, session replay does straddle the line between effective optimization tool and privacy nightmare. It’s worth evaluating the stance of your company on privacy and data security issues before implementing one of these tools.</p>



<p>What do you think? Let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Osama Bin Laden wearing Casio FW91" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=239%2C300&amp;ssl=1 239w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=335%2C420&amp;ssl=1 335w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Osama bin Laden wearing the iconic F-91W.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>

<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=696%2C500&amp;ssl=1" alt="Casio FW91" width="696" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=585%2C420&amp;ssl=1 585w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>

It is also pointed out how music and the arts can be formally understood as a consequence of
the principle of artificial curiosity and creativity.

<br><em>Here we focus
on automatic creation of predictable internal
abstractions of complex spatio- temporal events:
two competing, intrinsically motivated agents agree on essentially
arbitrary algorithmic experiments and bet 
on their possibly surprising (not yet predictable) 
outcomes in zero-sum games, 
each agent potentially profiting from outwitting / surprising
the other by inventing  experimental protocols where both
modules disagree on the predicted outcome.  The focus is on exploring
the space of general algorithms (as opposed to
traditional simple mappings from inputs to
outputs);  the 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/explorepredictable"> general system </a>

things by losing interest in both …</em></p></span></div></div></div>
