Question: Tell me more about Bastille Networks</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley: <a href="https://www.bastille.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille</span></a><span> is the leader in enterprise threat detection through software-defined radio. Bastille provides full visibility into the known and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/risks-of-cryptojacking-in-mobile-devices/">unknown mobile</a>, wireless, and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/secure-your-iot-devices/">Internet of Things devices</a> inside an enterprise’s corporate airspace–together known as the Internet of Radios. Through its patented software-defined radio and machine learning technology, Bastille senses, identifies, and localizes threats, providing security teams the ability to accurately quantify risk and mitigate airborne threats that could pose a danger to network infrastructure.</span></b></p><h3><b>2. Question: What’s unique and different about Bastille than other solutions/companies?</b></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley</strong>: Until Bastille, there was no way to apply network security mechanisms and countermeasures to RF-enabled IoT devices. IT security professionals couldn’t buy a security service like </span><a href="https://www.bastille.net/product/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille Enterprise</span></a><span> until we invented it.</span></p><h3><strong>3. Question: Can you dive into radio frequency security and why it’s essential for enterprises?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> Corporate airspaces are under attack from invisible threats operating on Radio Frequencies (RF). Enterprises are often crucially reliant on wireless protocols, some that they don’t even know they’re using (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.). </span></p><p><span>These protocols are used in building controls and building access, for employee communications, IT, for employees. The exploitation of vulnerable wireless devices is growing increasingly common. Sophisticated attacks use compromised RF devices as their entry points into government and corporate networks. Foreign governments, competitors, and cybercriminals are conducting radio-based attacks on enterprises to access intellectual property and sensitive information.</span></p><h3><strong>4. Question: Can you discuss the importance of why enterprises need to implement and enforce more nuanced electronic device policies to accurately distinguish between approved and unapproved electronic devices in secure areas?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> RF-enabled devices are everywhere: According to Statistica, there are 4.7 billion Cellular phones, 8.4 billion Bluetooth devices, and 9 billion Wi-Fi devices, added to this is the increasing use of “wearables” such as FitBits and other personal devices with embedded radios, with a variety of audio/video capture, pairing and transmission capabilities.</span></p><p><span>Current policies are outdated: While some government and commercial buildings have secure areas where no cell phones or other RF-emitting devices are allowed, detecting and locating radio-enabled devices is largely based on the honor system or one time scans for devices. Bad actors do not follow the honor system and one time scans are, just that, one time and cannot monitor 24×7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>New solutions for a new age:</span><span> Bastille</span><span> enables security teams to differentiate between </span><b>approved and unapproved devices, and </b><span>accurately places </span><b>dots on a floor-plan map </b><span>for device location and sends alerts when a device is found where it should not be or doing what it should not do.</span> <span>Bastille</span><span> Networks also integrates with existing security systems such as Splunk, MDM, and camera systems.</span></p><h3><b>5. Question: What cybersecurity measures would you recommend for enterprises and why?</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley:&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Take Control of Your Airspace:<span> Obtain visibility into devices that use the big four protocols: cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and BLE. Locating every radio emitter provides situational awareness into devices in an enterprise’s network.</span></b></p><ul><li><b>Evaluate RF Technology:<span> Assessing RF security solutions is vital in preserving company secrets. As security teams examine RF products in the market, considering a checklist of capabilities should include solutions that can detect, analyze, alert, and accurately locate cellular devices that incorporate airspaces in real-time.</span></b></li><li><b>Deploy RF Solutions:<span> Proactively equipping an organization with RF security technology will future-proof an enterprise from an RF breach. Adopting RF solutions that constantly monitor and detect the transmissions of devices in the wireless spectrum will combat nefarious attacks.</span></b></li></ul><h3><strong>6. Question: Can you shed more light on Bastille Express?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> Earlier this year, Bastille launched </span><a href="https://www.bastille.net/product/bastille-express" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille Express</span></a><span>, the commercial version of the government spec Bastille FlyAway Kit, for forward-deployed locations.</span></p><p><span>Bastille Express</span><span> can detect and locate authorized and unauthorized Cellular, Bluetooth, BLE, and Wi-Fi devices operating within an area of 3,000 to 5,000 square feet such as conference meeting rooms, remote offices, hotel areas, or speaking locations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bastille.net/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=640%2C163&amp;ssl=1" alt="Bastille networks logo" width="640" height="163" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1024%2C261&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=300%2C76&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=768%2C196&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1536%2C391&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=2048%2C522&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1024%2C261&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=300%2C76&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=768%2C196&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1536%2C391&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=2048%2C522&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=640%2C163&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p>Visit the official <a href="https://www.bastille.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bastille Networks website</a></p><p><strong>SIMILAR INTERVIEWS</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/interview-with-paul-lipman-bullguard/" rel="bookmark">Exclusive Interview With Paul Lipman, CEO Of BullGuard</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/interview-with-matt-davey-1password/" rel="bookmark">Exclusive Interview With Matt Davey, COO Of 1Password</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/how-to-secure-and-protect-a-website/" rel="bookmark">How To Secure And Protect A Website [We Asked 38 Experts]</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/interview-with-hugh-taylor-digital-downfall/" rel="bookmark">Exclusive Interview With Hugh Taylor, Author Of Digital Downfall</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/effective-cybersecurity-strategy-for-a-small-business/" rel="bookmark">Most Effective Cybersecurity Strategy For A Small Business [We Asked 45+ Experts]</a></li></ul><div><ul><li><a href="#abh_about">Author</a></li><li><a href="#abh_posts">Recent Posts</a></li></ul><div><section itemscope="" itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><a href="http://www.techsegun.com/" target="_blank" title="Daniel Segun" rel="nofollow"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/daniel-segun-author-pic.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1" alt="Daniel Segun" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/daniel-segun-author-pic.jpg?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><div><p>Daniel Segun is the Founder and CEO of SecureBlitz Cybersecurity Media, with a background in Computer Science and Digital Marketing.

July 27, 2020 | https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2020/07/26/remote-wsl2-clojure/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2020/07/26/remote-wsl2-clojure/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the last few years I’ve been developing predominantly on Apple
MacBooks. Recently I built myself a
<a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/bestelkosten/2370528">new</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922">PC</a> with a fast
processor and lots of memory. I wanted to move some of my development tasks to
that machine. I still like the freedom that laptops give me to work from
wherever I want. Be it from the couch in my own home or from a random coffee
place in the city where I live, I just like to change environment every few
hours and not sit behind my desk all day long. I hadn’t used Windows as my
primary OS for almost 10 years. But since Windows 10 (still) comes with RDP,
which is better than VNC in terms of performance, and with WSL2, which offers a
“real” and well integrated linux experience, I was curious if I could create a
setup for remotely working on the new machine. It also would give me an
environment to debug Windows specific problems on, which should come in handy
for my side projects like <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">babashka</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/">clj-kondo</a>. If it didn’t work out, I
could always go dual boot with Ubuntu as the primary dev OS and use VNC if I
needed to do anything graphical. For what it is worth, here is a report of
setup process I went through.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pristine smell and beauty of a new PC contrasted with the chaotic reality of my home. <a href="https://t.co/3zLIzYg4XB">pic.twitter.com/3zLIzYg4XB</a></p>— (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Because I had no other Windows machines in my home, I tried creating a USB
Windows installation drive in macOS based on
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-make-a-windows-10-usb-using-your-mac-build-a-bootable-iso-from-your-macs-terminal/">this</a>
blog post. No matter what I tried, at the end of the installation process
Windows <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280943718363734016">would complain</a> with</p>

<blockquote><p>Windows installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the
installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Installing Ubuntu on new PC. The installer is surprisingly smooth, detects my wifi, even nvidia video card apparently. Whereas Windows be like <a href="https://t.co/FQNzeJ6V2X">pic.twitter.com/FQNzeJ6V2X</a></p>— (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280943718363734016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>A good friend offered help and created an installation drive using
<a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> on his Windows Home installation, which did work.</p>

<p>Once Windows was installed, I <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-allow-access">enabled RDP</a> and installed
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL2</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71">Ubuntu 20.04</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Windows Terminal</a>
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/">Docker Desktop for WSL2</a>.</p>

<p>To be able to run WSL2, I had to enable a virtualization option in my BIOS
first.</p>

<p>I intend to use Ubuntu WSL2 as my primary dev environment on this machine, so it
made sense to tweak the <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1456511/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-default-shell-in-windows-terminal">Terminal configuration</a>
to open Ubuntu by default, instead of PowerShell. I found it annoying that
Ubuntu in Terminal starts in the Windows home directory (<code>/mnt/c/Users/borkdude</code>), so I set <code>"startingDirectory":
"//wsl$/Ubuntu-20.04/home/borkdude"</code> in my Ubuntu profile.</p>

<p>I use zsh as my default shell on macOS and wanted that in WSL2 as well so I
installed that using <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install zsh</code> followed by <code>chsh -s $(which
zsh)</code>. I also installed <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> and enabled the
only two plugins I use on a daily basis: <code>git</code> and <code>jump</code>.</p>

<p>Then I started porting the dev setup I use for work on my MacBook, mainly
consisting of Docker images, a couple of Clojure projects, knitted together with
some bash scripts. I use a couple of shell scripts to set all my development
environment variables and aliases for easily setting up ssh tunnels. These
worked after only making a few tweaks (for example, the ethernet card is called
differently in macOS and Ubuntu in WSL2). Of course I needed to install <code>git</code> to
clone my work projects. To run Clojure projects I installed OpenJDK version 8
and 11 via <code>apt</code>. I use <a href="https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2020/07/26/remote-wsl2-clojure/jenv.be">jenv</a> to manage Java versions on a project
basis, which worked perfectly:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
</span><span>jenv add /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Also I installed <a href="https://boot-clj.com/">boot</a>, a Clojure build tool and the
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">Clojure CLI</a> which are all well
supported in linux.</p>

<p>Before running my work projects, I wanted to copy over a PostgreSQL database and
other data from my MacBook using <code>rsync</code>. Before I could do that, I needed to
enable <code>ssh</code> in Ubuntu. I found out I could do this by running <code>sudo service ssh
start</code> but I still could not log in from my MacBook. It turns out you also have
to forward and open up the port in the Windows Firewall. I found
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723">this</a>
PowerShell script that lets you do that. As the comment suggests, I also created
a scheduled task that runs this script upon Windows login. I did the same thing
for running the <code>ssh</code> service using <code>wsl -u root sudo service ssh start</code>. Be
sure to select <code>Run using the highest privileges</code>. I’m sure there is a better
way to do this via <code>systemd</code> in WSL2, but this works for me. So now I could
<code>rsync</code> my the data from macOS to WSL2. I started the Docker containers, the
Clojure projects and it worked! We have a fairly I/O intensive process as part
of our stack, which seems to perform well in WSL2.</p>

<p>Enabling SSH in WSL also lets me use Emacs from my laptop and edit files on the
remote machine using <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">tramp mode</a>. I
ran into one issue with this. Since I use a non-standard prompt in zsh, emacs
tramp could not parse the output from the remote shell. So I added this hack to
my <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>case</span> <span>"$TERM"</span> in
</span><span>    <span>"dumb"</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>        bash
</span><span><span>esac</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Emacs sets <code>TERM</code> to <code>"dumb"</code> when opening files using <code>tramp</code>. When this is the
case, I just invoke <code>bash</code> instead of continuing with <code>zsh</code>. There may be a
better solution, but this works.</p>

<p>Of course I also wanted to be able to run Emacs on the machine itself. I first
tried to run Emacs in Windows <a href="https://github.com/m-parashar/emax64">natively</a>,
but I read somewhere that editing WSL2 files directly from Windows is not
recommended. Also you might run into the line ending differences between Windows
and linux/macOS. I decided to play it safe and install emacs inside WSL2 using
<code>apt</code>. If you do decide to use the Windows-native Emacs and have trouble finding
where emacs expects configuration files, you can find this using <code>M-x
describe-variable user-init-file</code>. On my machine that was
<code>C:\Users\borkdude\AppData\Roaming\.config\emacs\init.el.</code>. To get a graphical
UI for the emacs started from WSL2, I needed to install an X-server on
Windows. There are plenty of free and open source solutions to choose from, but
I chose to buy
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/x410/9nlp712zmn9q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">X410</a>
on sale for $9.99 instead of $49.99. It seems to be actively worked on and has
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/using-x410-with-wsl2/">good documentation</a>. To
automatically start X410 on Windows startup I followed
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/automatically-start-x410-on-login/">these</a>
instructions. When started, in the tray there is an X icon where you can modify
settings for X410. I have enabled Windowed Apps, Allow Public Access, DPI
Scaling (High Quality) and Shared Clipboard. To export the right <code>DISPLAY</code> value
for GUI applications in WSL2 I have this in my <code>.zshenv</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat /etc/resolv.conf <span>|</span> grep nameserver <span>|</span> awk <span>'{print $2; exit;}'</span><span>)</span>:0.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>and then run emacs using <code>setsid emacs</code> from a zsh session (I created an alias
for this in my <code>.zshenv</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using the exact same emacs config I use on macOS, which is based on
<a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">@bbatsov</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">prelude</a>. It looks and feels the same as on
macOS, although now I probably have to learn the “real” emacs keybindings for
copying (<code>M-w</code>) and pasting (<code>C-y</code>) instead of using the macOS keybindings,
which may be in fact a nice side effect of this experiment.</p>

<p>Even connecting to an nREPL server with <code>cider-connect</code> works seemlessly from my
laptop, provided that I forward and open up the port in Windows Firewall like
described above.</p>

<p>Some closing tips.</p>

<p>There is a known <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">issue</a> with
memory usage of WSL2. Since linux uses non-allocated memory for filesystem
caching, Windows thinks this memory is really used. As time goes by, Windows
could end up allocating all your system’s memory to WSL2. To put a limit to
this, I use this config in <code>C:\Users\borkdude\.wslconfig</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>[</span>wsl2<span>]</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>memory</span><span>=</span>92GB
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>My PC has a whopping 128GB of memory so this still leaves 36GB of memory to
Windows.</p>

<p>As I will mainly use this PC for work, I turn it off at night and during the
weekends. To get back where I left, without restarting all my development
processes from scratch, I use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/920730/how-to-disable-and-re-enable-hibernation-on-a-computer-that-is-running">Hibernate</a>
setting.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to set up a VPN between my laptop and
Windows machine so I can connect through RDP, emacs tramp and/or nREPL when I go
outside of my home.</p>

<p>For RDP I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12">Microsoft Remote Desktop.app</a>. Since I have a Retina screen, I enabled the “optimize for Retina displays” setting which gives a better resolution.</p>

<p>As a bonus I can re-use some licenses I already owned for apps I am using on
macOS: Beyond Compare and Acronis True Image.</p>

<p>I’m pleasantly surprised with WSL2, the Terminal app and Docker
integration. I’ve only been using this setup for week but so far so good.</p>

    <p>Last week, I talked about <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/repetition-automation-organization-disconnection">repetition, automation, organization, and disconnection</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ever since I started the podcast, I've had to prepare, manually, multiple texts in order to release each episode in various podcast providers—Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast—on the Getting Simple website, and on the newsletter.</p>
<p>Each text was slightly different and editing them by hand wasn't pleasing. I've released dozens of episodes this way.</p>
<p>I've completed a round of code edits I've been working on over the past months to automate most of the tedious work required each time I publish a new episode, and released <a target="_blank" href="https://gettingsimple.com/podcast/latest">a new podcast page layout and audio player</a>.<sup id="fnref:work-or-walk-new-layout"><a href="#fn:work-or-walk-new-layout" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, I have individual text boxes for each component of the episode notes, including the episode summary, description, links, credits, release date, duration, and more.</p>
<p>I can now create new episodes with ease and preview the content that will show up on podcast providers, the website, and the newsletter, with the satisfaction of having made it possible on my own instead of relying on other platforms.</p>
<hr>
<p>After more than thirty episodes, repetition removed friction from my podcast-releasing workflow. Yet I won't ever be faster than an automatic system that apart from freeing my time reduces potential human error.</p>
<p>The system I have in place makes my entire episode library highly organized, helping me focus on new content and reducing stress.</p>
<p>Altogether, automated systems such as this one can let us disconnect and reclaim time to be humans.</p>
<p>Whether you continue working or go for walk in the time you get back is on you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p><p>If you want to skip the groundwork-laying and jump straight to the proposal-proposing, click <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="#a-modest-proposal">here</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The current slate of OSS funding platforms — GitHub Sponsors, OpenCollective, Tidelift,  bug bounty programs — aren't cutting it. To understand why, it's important to understand one thing:</p><h2>Open-source projects are not created equal</h2><p>As I set out to write this essay, a new article (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">How to pay your rent with your open source project</a>) hit the front page of HN. I read it eagerly, hoping it would solve open-source sustainability and spare me the effort of writing this.</p><p>Sadly, it didn't; but it did provide a great framing device for this intro!</p><p>Most of the OSS projects referenced by that article — Discourse, Matrix, GitLab, Sentry, Standard Notes, Sourcehut, Blender — are <strong>application-level projects</strong> that lend themselves well to a "managed hosting for enterprise" model. </p><p>The rest — Elementary OS, Ghost, Webpack —&nbsp;are <strong>structural tools</strong>: operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, etc. These tools are more complex and harder to maintain, but they're in a more privileged position to extract some of the value they create for their users, especially corporate ones. Livewire, the project that earned Caleb Porzio $100k of annual sponsorship revenue, is firmly in this category.<a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">²</a></p><p>But most open source projects aren't hostable applications or structural tools. Most are better described as <strong>utilities</strong> —&nbsp;an apt term for the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in today's world. The only utility library mentioned in the "pay rent" article is the background processing gem Sidekiq...and it's funded via support calls billed hourly by the creator. 😒</p><h2>Have some rain with that parade</h2><p>The simple truth is it's rare and difficult for a utility library to inspire enough appreciation to get financial sponsorship. As the creator/maintainer of a modestly popular (1.1k stars) TypeScript validation library, I've seen this firsthand.</p><p>But I'm a bad case study. Instead let's consider arguably the most successful open-sourcer on GitHub, the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/sindresorhus">Sindre Sorhus</a>. His repositories (predominantly small utilities) have accumulated over <a href="https://gitstar-ranking.com/sindresorhus">479,000 total stars</a> and his packages are downloaded nearly <a href="https://gist.github.com/bcoe/dcc961b869bbf6685002">2 <em>billion</em> times a month</a>.</p><p>By my estimation, he's making roughly $27k annually from GitHub Sponsors (computed from his <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/sindresorhus">available Sponsor tiers</a> and <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/thanks">his "thanks" page</a> — left as an exercise for the reader), a <a href="https://opencollective.com/sindresorhus">little over $10k</a> from Open Collective, and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sindresorhus">$6k</a> from Patreon. It's harder to estimate his earnings from Tidelift but presumably they're in a similar ballpark. This is the #1 guy on GitHub and he's making less than an entry level engineer, from donations at least. Not ideal.</p><p>Or look at <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based SPAs, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. The fact that creating a tool as ubiquitous and successful as react-router still wouldn't pay the rent is...deflating.</p><h2>The problem with everything else</h2><p>Why is there such a gap between the value created by open source software and the funding it receives?</p><p>Consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>The wording of this question is very deliberate. By drawing an implicit comparison to your annual income, you're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchored high</a>. I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me.</p><p><strong>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</strong> </p><p>All open-source donations are still distributed on a piecemeal basis. We must suffer the pain of creating <em>yet another</em> auto-renewing monthly subscription for <em>each and every</em> project we want to support. And at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor react-router!"</em>) it's all too easy to "logic" ourselves out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a massive dampening effect on the total amount of money donated to OSS.</p><p>So even though we set out with the best intentions, only the projects that are massively, indisputably valuable to us make the cut. Those indisputably valuable projects tend to be the "big stuff" — frameworks, structural tooling, and fully-implemented self-hostable tools. </p><p>So the small stuff languishes. And most open-source software is small stuff. </p><p>But I don't write essays just to spout pessimism into the world! So below I propose a novel-ish approach to OSS sustainability. I aim to apply what I know about incentive design, conversion rate optimization, and human psychology to bring financial contributions to open-source in closer alignment with the actual value it creates.</p><p>The concept is simple...</p><p><strong>Donors should make annual contributions to a personal "sponsorship pool". This pool is then distributed to the projects they want to support.</strong></p><p>...but the devil's in the details so grab your weedwhacker. We're going in.</p><h2>Annual contributions</h2><p>This is the least important part, but I believe that framing donations as annual contributions will result in more total dollars donated. This goes back to the question  of "How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?". That's the question you want donors to be answering in their heads; monthly contributions is antithetical to that.</p><p>Of course, monthly contributions to a sponsorship pool would still be <em>vastly</em> superior to piecemeal sponsorships on a per-project basis.</p><h2>Pool allocation</h2><p>There are a number of possible mechanisms for distributing the contents of these sponsorship pools.</p><h3>The obvious solution</h3><p>The brute force solution would involve some simple interface for searching across GitHub Sponsors/Patreon/Open Collectives and selecting a set of recipients for your money. This would likely require buy-in from all of those entities, since their APIs don’t support programmatic creation of donations/sponsorships (in fact, Patreon just deprecated their entire API 😑). Seems reasonable, if a bit tedious. </p><h3>Attention-based distribution</h3><p>Let's get clever! You could distribute donations proportional to usage or attention.</p><p>The most successful precedent for this is the <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p><img alt="https://vriad.com/brave_rewards.png" src="https://vriad.com/brave_rewards.png"></p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p><h3>A stellar proposal</h3><p>Here’s an idea: what if your donation was distributed evenly between all the repos you’ve starred on GitHub?</p><p>More specifically — each month, 1/12th of your annual donation will be paid out evenly across the projects you've starred. The payouts should run on a <em>monthly</em> schedule — not annual! This regularizes the income stream for maintainers and gives donors more granular temporal control over how their money is distributed. If you discover a great new library, you be able to add it your pool and have that be reflected in next month's allocations.</p><p><strong>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.</strong> Once a person has funded their sponsorship pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to add a new project as a recipient of your your sponsorship pool. The marginal cost — <em>both psychological and financial!</em> — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero. That's a game changer.</p><h3>The GitHub implementation</h3><p>If GitHub implemented something to this, they would undoubtedly divorce the allocation mechanism from Stars. They want to keep the concept of a "star" as ambiguous and unencumbered as possible. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsorship pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the standard "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><blockquote><h4>Financial considerations for GitHub</h4><p>GitHub seems to have a financial incentive to switch to a system like this. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Switching to larger, annual donations means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed, they'll still end up paying more in fees, even if the ratio of fees:donations is smaller. If the sponsorship pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p></blockquote><h3>Non-equal distribution</h3><p>To allow the awarding of different fractional amounts to different projects, a <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011350967-Claps">Medium-style "claps"</a> metric could be used instead. The pool would be distributed proportial to claps.</p><h2>Social proof</h2><p>Final thought —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable badges that are "unlocked" at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;I can imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim.</p><p>Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>You may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>Theoretically you, dear reader, could take these ideas and implement them. I wouldn't advise it; there's not much money in open-source, and even less in open-source donation processing. The most likely (and likely best case) …</p></div></div>

However, it still requires a considerable effort to write types and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seem redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind, <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">GraphQL Code Generator</a> gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:</strong> forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong> as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the dependencies needed:</p><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre></pre><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre></pre><p>I'm considering the following folder structure, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><pre><p><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>┗ package.json</span></p></pre></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project, named <code>codegen.yml</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Flu (influenza) and pneumonia vaccinations are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, according to new research reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference® (AAIC®) 2020.</p>

<p>Three research studies reported at AAIC 2020 suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least one flu vaccination was associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. </li>
<li>More frequent flu vaccination was associated
with another 13% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence.</li>
<li>Vaccination against pneumonia between ages 65 and 75 reduced Alzheimer's risk by up to 40% depending on individual genes.</li>
<li>Individuals with dementia have a higher risk of dying (6-fold) after infections than those without dementia (3-fold).</li>
</ul>

<p>"With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussions. It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes," said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer.</p>

<p>"It may turn out to be as simple as if you're taking care of your health in this way — getting vaccinated — you're also taking care of yourself in other ways, and these things add up to lower risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias," Carrillo said. "This research, while early, calls for further studies in large, diverse clinical trials to inform whether vaccinations as a public health strategy decrease our risk for developing dementia as we age."</p>

<h2>Seasonal Flu Vaccine May Reduce Incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia</h2>

<p>Previous research has suggested vaccinations may have a protective factor against cognitive decline, but there have been no large, comprehensive studies focused on the influenza (flu) vaccine and Alzheimer's disease risk, specifically. To address this gap, Albert Amran, a medical student at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and team, investigated a large American health record dataset (n=9,066).</p>

<p>Amran and team found having one flu vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.83, p&lt;0.0001), and among vaccinated patients receiving the flu vaccine more frequently was associated with an even lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.87, p=0.0342). Thus, people that consistently got their annual flu shot had a lower risk of Alzheimer's. This translated to an almost 6% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease for patients between the ages of 75-84 for 16 years.</p>

<p>The researchers found the protective association between the flu vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer's was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age — for example, the people who received their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefited more than those who received their first flu shot at age 70.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention — the flu shot — may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer's dementia," Amran said. "More research is needed to explore the biological mechanism for this effect — why and how it works in the body — which is important as we explore effective preventive therapies for Alzheimer's."</p>

<h2>Pneumonia Vaccine May Reduce Alzheimer's Risk later in life.</h2><p>
 Repurposing of existing vaccines may be a promising approach to Alzheimer's disease prevention. Svetlana Ukraintseva, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Duke University Social Science Research Institute, and team, investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination, with and without an accompanying seasonal flu shot, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease among 5,146 participants age 65+ from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The team also took into account a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's — the rs2075650 G allele in the TOMM40 gene.</p>

<p>The researchers found that pneumococcal vaccination between ages 65-75 reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's by 25-30% after adjusting for sex, race, birth cohort, education, smoking, and number of G alleles. The largest reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's (up to 40%) was observed among people vaccinated against pneumonia who were non-carriers of the risk gene. Total number of vaccinations against pneumonia and the flu between ages 65 and 75 was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's; however, the effect was not evident for the flu shot alone.</p>

<p>"Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life, depending on individual genotype," Ukraintseva said. "These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer's prevention, particularly in non-carriers of certain risk genes."</p>

<h2>Infection Substantially Increases Mortality in People with Dementia</h2>

<p>People living with dementia commonly experience other health conditions including viral, bacterial, and other infections. There is a growing trend in research to investigate whether infections might be worsening, more life-threatening or possibly causing dementia.</p>

<p>Janet Janbek, a Ph.D. student at the Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and team, used data from national health registries to investigate mortality in Danish residents over age 65 (n=1,496,436) who had visited the hospital with an infection. They found that people with both dementia and such hospital visits died at a 6.5 times higher rate compared with people who had neither. Study participants with either dementia alone or infection-related contacts alone had a threefold increased rate. The rate of mortality was highest within the first 30 days following the hospital visit.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that for people living with dementia the mortality rates remained elevated for 10 years after the initial infection-related hospital visit, and mortality rates from all infections (including major infections like sepsis to minor ear infections) were higher compared with people without dementia or without an infection-related hospital visit.</p>

<p>"Our study supports the need to investigate these relations even further; to find out why infections are linked to higher mortality in people with dementia, specifically which risk factors and biological mechanisms are involved. This will help advance our understanding of the role of infections in dementia," said Janbek.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that the health care system — as well as relatives of people with dementia — should have increased awareness of people with dementia who get infections, so they get the medical care they need. People with dementia require more specialized treatment even when their hospital visits are not directly due to their dementia but to what might appear to be an unrelated infection," Janbek added.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
        

        <p><em>But why?</em> you are wondering. You must be given some context: this is an experiment <a href="https://github.com/franciscop/create-static-web">inside another experiment I'm doing</a> to learn about Static Site Generators. PHP is the first language I knew well and I wanted to test whether it's a horrible or just a bad idea to use it for templates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you come from Google trying to find how to run PHP inside Javascript, you are very likely lost. Beware, this article is only for experts! <a title="the '/s' stands for 'sarcasm'" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%2Fs">/s</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since a large motivator for my site generator is to rely purely on Node.js and <em>not</em> to have to install Ruby, I also don't want to install PHP! But can you run PHP inside Javascript? I only need the most basic PHP features: variables, echo, loops.</p>
<p>The sarcastic language of this article might be deceiving, but there is <strong><a href="#demo">a working demo below</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="initial-objective">Initial objective</h2>
<p>The idea came when I was making FrontMatter work properly for the current file. It is also related to my general dissatisfaction with the Node.js template engines, but that a topic for another day:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: Running PHP in Javascript
---
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{{title}}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta content="{{title}}" property="og:title" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It reminded me quite a bit to what can be achieved with raw PHP:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;? $title = "Running PHP in Javascript"; ?&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;&lt;?= $title ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta content="&lt;?= $title ?&gt;" property="og:title" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="googling-around">Googling around</h2>
<p>Google just led me to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=run+php+inside+javascript">780 StackOverflow questions</a> with <code>-1</code> average score. After reading some, I believe the average score should be more like <code>-5</code>. I also learned that devs are trying to do:</p>
<pre><code>alert("&lt;?= "Hello world" ?&gt;");</code></pre>
<p>As an astute reader might notice, that is supposed to run first through the PHP server, <em>then</em> sent to the browser and finally run the resulting <code>alert("Hello world")</code> on the client. But this level of sophistication is too high, I just want to run raw PHP on the browser! I want something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// No server needed, "just" Javascript parsing PHP
alert(php(`&lt;?= "Hello world" ?&gt;`));</code></pre>
<p>But not even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/search?q=php">Reddit's "PHP" search</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/"> <code>r/atwoodslaw</code></a> could find what I seek.</p>
<h2 id="promising-finds">Promising finds</h2>
<p>After getting lucky with a <em>"PHP parser Javascript"</em> search, I end up finding the package <a href="https://github.com/glayzzle/php-parser"><code>php-parser</code> in Github/npm</a>. The problem is that the output is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em></a>. I just wanted to run the code, not whatever an abstract tree seems to be:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/abstract-architecture-art-artistic-262577/"><img src="https://francisco.io/blog/running-php-in-javascript/abstract-tree.q50.jpg" alt="An abstract tree somehow"></a></p>
<p>Since you are reading this it means that in the <a href="https://github.com/glayzzle/php-parser#related-projects"><em>Related Projects</em></a> category I found my next clue. I head to the website with the <span title="I know, it's a tanuki ;)">funny looking cat</span>: <a href="https://gitlab.com/kornelski/babel-preset-php"><code>babel-preset-php</code></a>. It transpiles PHP into Javascript 🎉</p>
<p>Since babel is in total chaos with the whole <code>babel-loader</code> vs <code>@babel/loader</code> and no one knows which one is which (ironic, innit?), I give up and take a break. I do practice <a href="https://core.cards/">my Kanjis</a>, speak with my family in Spanish and think about the English title for this article.</p>
<h2 id="building-up-the-library">Building up the library</h2>
<p>Fresh again, I scavenge the library <code>babel-preset-php</code> for my project. I am now using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>php-parser</code> to transform the PHP into the Abstract Tree thing.</li>
<li><code>babel-preset-php</code> ravaged files to do something that I have no idea what it is but it's the only way to keep it working.</li>
<li><code>@babel/generator</code> to finally generate the Javascript from the previous step.</li>
<li>A bit of Javascript. I use the fancier <code>new Function()</code> to pretend it's better than <code>eval()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't going to show you, but since my code is so tiny thanks to those great libraries I can just paste it here for your satisfaction:</p>
<pre><code>import parser from 'php-parser';
import translator from './translator';
import generator from '@babel/generator';

const run = (code, opts) =&gt; {
  // Make a closure so that `out` doesn't collide with the PHP variables:
  let out = '';
  // Define `echo` since it's used in the transpiled JS code for some reason
  opts.echo = opts.echo || (str =&gt; out += str);
  // Pretend this is safe. Pro tip: IT IS NOT SAFE
  new Function(...Object.keys(opts), code)(...Object.values(opts));
  return out;
}

export default function (src, opts = {}) {
  const ast = new parser().parseCode(src);
  const file = translator.translateProgram(ast);
  const code = generator(file).code;
  return run(code, opts);
};</code></pre>
<p>Later on I will export some individual parts for better testing, but that is really all there is to it.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>The long-awaited demo! Turn your internet off, hide your kids and say your prayers. I already loaded <a href="https://francisco.io/blog/running-php-in-javascript/php.min.js">the <code>php()</code> function</a> for you, but are you <em>ready</em> to run it?</p>

<form id="horrible">


</form>


<p>Tips to make the demo better for <a href="https://documentation.agency/">lack of documentation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">backticks</a> as the first argument of <code>php()</code> to allow for any quote type and multi line.</li>
<li>Provide a second argument as a plain object like <code>{ hello: 'world' }</code> to define the variable <code>$hello</code> with the value <code>"world"</code> inside the PHP code.</li>
<li>If you want to run it with express use <code>{ _GET: req.query, _POST: req.body }</code> as the second argument (do <em>not</em> do it, specially on a live server).</li>
<li>You could pass <code>window</code> as the second argument as well if you prefer PHP instead of Javascript. Heck, you could make a tool that finds and runs all <code>&lt;script src="ohmy.php"  type="application/php"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>I am running <code>eval()</code> against your code. The php() function is basically running <code>eval()</code> internally. Do I get a "Go to Jail card" for basically doing <code>eval(eval(...))</code>?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>
<p>Yup, this sucks. Use it just as an example of things that should never happen. If you <em>really, really</em> need to use this, and want more features, feel free to throw me loads of money and I might consider talking you out of it or contacting the relevant health authorities.</p>
<p>Now that we have reached this point and seeing how many languages have AST generators, I ponder: can <em>any</em> language be transpiled to Javascript? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY-pUxKQMUE">Should we do it?</a> Webassembly is going to eat JS so we might just give it a try!</p>
<p>If you hate PHP, or Javascript, and you <em>really</em> want to let me and others know<a title="You want to feel like you belong, but spreading hate on PHP won't change the fact that no one really likes you...">*</a> feel free to comment on Hacker News:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>So <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> came out while I wasn't looking last week. The
GnuTLS advisory (<a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03</a>) is pretty opaque so I'll
refer instead to <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1270061316368224256">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> (Go team
security lead):</p>

<blockquote><p>PSA: don't rely on GnuTLS, please.</p>

<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> Whoops, for the past 10 releases most TLS 1.0–1.2
connection could be passively decrypted and most TLS 1.3 connections
intercepted. Trivially.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets/">TLS 1.2–1.0 session tickets are awful</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are reading this correctly: supposedly encrypted TLS connections
made with affected GnuTLS releases are vulnerable to <em>passive</em>
cleartext recovery attack (and active for 1.3, but who uses that
anyways). That is extremely bad. It's pretty close to just switching
everyone to HTTP instead of HTTPS, more or less. I would have a lot
more to say about the security of GnuTLS in particular -- and security
in general -- but I am mostly concerned about patching holes in the
roof right now, so this article is not about that.</p>

<p>This article is about figuring out what, exactly, was exposed in our
infrastructure because of this.</p>






<p>Assuming you're running Debian, this will show a list of packages that
<code>Depends</code> on GnuTLS:</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you run this only on hosts running Buster or
above. Otherwise you'll need to figure out a way to pick machines
running GnuTLS 3.6.4 or later.</p>

<p>Note that this list only <em>first level</em> dependencies! It is perfectly
possible that another package uses GnuTLS without being listed
here. For example, in the above list I have <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code>, so the
be really thorough, I would actually need to recurse down the
dependency tree.</p>

<p>On my desktop, this shows an "interesting" list of targets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt</code></li>
<li><code>cadaver</code> - AKA WebDAV</li>
<li><code>curl</code> &amp; <code>wget</code></li>
<li><code>fwupd</code> - another attack on top of <a href="https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md">this one</a></li>
<li><code>git</code> (through the <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code> dependency)</li>
<li><code>mutt</code> - all your emails</li>
<li><code>weechat</code> - your precious private chats</li>
</ul>


<p>Arguably, fetchers like <code>apt</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>fwupd</code>, and <code>wget</code> rely on HTTPS for
"authentication" more than secrecy, although <code>apt</code> has its own
OpenPGP-based authentication so that wouldn't matter anyways. Still,
this is truly distressing. And I haven't mentioned here things like
<code>gobby</code>, <code>network-manager</code>, <code>systemd</code>, and others - the scope of this is
broad. Hell, even good old <code>lynx</code> links against GnuTLS.</p>

<p>In our infrastructure, the magic command looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cumin -o txt -p 0  'F:lsbdistcodename=buster' "apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u" | tee gnutls-rdepds-per-host | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>There, the result is even more worrisome, as those important packages seem to rely on GnuTLS for their transport security:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mariadb</code> - all MySQL traffic and passwords</li>
<li><code>mandos</code> - full disk encryption</li>
<li><code>slapd</code> - LDAP passwords</li>
</ul>


<p><code>mandos</code> is especially distressing although it's probably not
vulnerable because it seems it doesn't store the cleartext -- it's
encrypted with the client's OpenPGP public key -- so the TLS tunnel
never sees the cleartext either.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/1270078914996682753">Other reports</a> have also mentioned the following servers link
against GnuTLS and could be vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exim</code></li>
<li><code>rsyslog</code></li>
<li><code>samba</code></li>
<li>various <code>VNC</code> implementations</li>
</ul>




<p>Those programs are not affected by this vulnerability:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apache2</code></li>
<li><code>gnupg</code></li>
<li><code>python</code></li>
<li><code>nginx</code></li>
<li><code>openssh</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This list is not exhaustive, naturally, but serves as an example of
common software you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>The vulnerability only exists in GnuTLS, as far as we know, so
programs linking against other libraries are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>Because the vulnerability affects session tickets -- and those are set
on the server side of the TLS connection -- only users of GnuTLS as a
server are vulnerable. This means, for example, that while <code>weechat</code>
uses GnuTLS, it will only suffer from the problem when acting as a
server (which it does, in relay mode) or, of course, if the remote IRC
server also uses GnuTLS. Same with apt, curl, wget, or git: it is
unlikely to be a problem because it is only used as a client; the
remote server is usually a webserver -- not git itself -- when using
TLS.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it's not because a package links against GnuTLS that
it <em>uses</em> it. For example, I have been told that, on Arch Linux, if
both GnuTLS and OpenSSL are available, the <code>mutt</code> package will use the
latter, so it's not affected. I haven't confirmed that myself nor have I
checked on Debian.</p>

<p>Also, because it relies on session tickets, there's a time window
after which the ticket gets cycled and properly initialized. But that
is <a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1270054740559384576">apparently 6 hours by default</a> so it is going to protect only
really long-lasting TLS sessions, which are uncommon, I would argue.</p>

<p>My audit is limited. For example, it might have been better to walk
the shared library dependencies directly, instead of relying on Debian
package dependencies.</p>



<p>It seems the vulnerability might have been introduced in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/695">this merge
request</a>, itself following a (entirely reasonable) <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/184">feature request
to make it easier to rotate session tickets</a>. The merge request was
open for a few months and was thoroughly reviewed by a peer before
being merged. Interestingly, the vulnerable function
(<code>_gnutls_initialize_session_ticket_key_rotation</code>), explicitly says:</p>

<pre><code> * This function will not enable session ticket keys on the server side. That is done
 * with the gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() function. This function just initializes
 * the internal state to support periodical rotation of the session ticket encryption key.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it thinks it is not responsible for session ticket
initialization, yet it is. Indeed, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275/">merge request fixing the
problem</a> unconditionally does this:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(session-&gt;key.initial_stek, key-&gt;data, key-&gt;size);
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't reviewed the code and the vulnerability in detail, so take
the above with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275.patch">full patch is available here</a>. See also the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011">upstream issue
1011</a>, the <a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">upstream advisory</a>, the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13777">Debian security
tracker</a>,
and the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843723">Redhat Bugzilla</a>.</p>



<p>The impact of this vulnerability depends on the affected packages and
how they are used. It can range from "meh, someone knows I downloaded
that Debian package yesterday" to "holy crap my full disk encryption
passwords are compromised, I need to re-encrypt all my drives",
including "I need to change all LDAP and MySQL passwords".</p>

<p>It promises to be a fun week for some people at least.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, one has to wonder whether we should follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a>'s advice and stop using GnuTLS altogether. There are
at least a few programs that link against GnuTLS because of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Licensing">OpenSSL licensing oddities</a> but that has been first announced in
2015, then <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/22/license/">definitely and clearly resolved in 2017</a> -- or <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/top-foss-legal-developments">maybe
that was in 2018</a>? Anyways it's fixed, pinky-promise-I-swear,
except if you're one of those weirdos still using GPL-2, of
course. Even though OpenSSL isn't the simplest and secure TLS
implementation out there, it could preferable to GnuTLS and maybe we
should consider changing Debian packages to use it in the future.</p>

<p>But then again, the last time something like this happened, it was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> and GnuTLS wasn't affected, so who knows... It is
likely that people don't have OpenSSL in mind when they suggest moving
away from GnuTLS and instead think of other TLS libraries like
<a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbedtls</a> (previously known as PolarSSL), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a>, <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL</a>,
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> and so on. Not that those are totally sinless either...</p>

<p>"This is fine", as they say...</p>

        <p>2020-07-26</p>

        <p>We’ve been doing a lot of mob programming at work the last year or so and I’ve seen that I have a different attitude to naming things than others on my team. When I see that a name can be improved I always think this is priority number one. My colleagues often say “later”.</p>

<p>I also saw something related recently when doing a programming course internally at work. I sat and helped a guy with an issue he was having. I saw a really bad variable name and recommended he change it. He said “later, I just need to fix this first”. I pushed the point once more saying “trust me” and then left him to his devices. A few minutes later he asked for help again, being totally stuck. Renaming the variable got him immediately unstuck. He had wasted lots of time because the name put him in a mental trap.</p>

<p>My philosophy is: <em>there are only two acceptable types of names: good names and metasyntactic names</em>. If you have a name that is bad or just a bit misleading it’s better to rename it to <code>foo</code> NOW.</p>

<p>I believe good (or metasyntactic) names lead to easier problem solving and less effort in programming. It’s not just something we add at the end to make the code more understandable to others or future you. To me the primary thing we work with in programming isn’t numbers or computation, but language.</p>

  <p><span>This essay was co-authored by <a href="https://kortina.nyc/">Andrew Kortina</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel">Namrata Patel</a>.</span></p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/04-kinky-labor-supply.png"><figcaption>Kinky (S<sub>1</sub>) vs classical (S<sub>0</sub>) labor supply curve.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Over the past few decades, labor force participation has sharply dropped for men ages 20-34. Theories about the root cause range from indolence, to a lack of skills and training, to offshoring, to (perhaps most interestingly) the increasing attractiveness and availability of leisure and media entertainment. In this essay, we propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signalling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.</p>

<p>At the macro level, this results in sub-optimal production, as firms are unable to satisfy their demand for labor via the usual mechanism of increasing wages. If you believe that economic productivity and growth are good, this presents a challenge when attempting to design stimulus policy, because subsidies or increases to the minimum wage would yield the same non-result as firms increasing wages. We discuss the potential efficacy of the somewhat radical idea of a tax on human attention or time spent consuming entertainment media as a way to stimulate productivity.</p>

<h3 id="declining-labor-participation-in-younger-demographics">Declining Labor Participation in Younger Demographics</h3>

<p>The overall labor force participation rate in the United States has been declining for the past several decades. The most obvious potential explanation would be an aging population (retirees comprising an increasing percentage of the overall population), but you can see this is not the root cause when you break out the labor force participation rate by age and sex:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/00-labor-participation.png"><figcaption>Labor Participation Rate via <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Labor participation has been dropping much faster for young men than any other groups. <em>(Interestingly, labor participation has been increasing most rapidly for older demographics, presumably because they must continue working later in life in order to support basic needs and healthcare costs).</em></p>

<p>In <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/maguiar/files/leisure-luxuries-labor-june-2017.pdf">Leisure Luxuries and the Labor Supply of Young Men</a>, Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite stagnant wages, declining employment rates, and an increased propensity to live with their parents, younger men report increased happiness during the 2000s. This contrasts sharply with older men, whose satisfaction fell along with their relative earnings. We see the life satisfaction results as indirect evidence that younger men experienced relatively little decline in the consumption and greatly valued their improved leisure options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of young men’s time which in past decades was spent working is now spent playing video games, according to Aguiar and Hurst. Given that reported happiness moved in the opposite direction from wages and employment rate, it would seem there is some preference for this specific type of leisure over the purchasing power sacrificed in the form of foregone wages. But given that leisure activities have always been an alternative to work, we should ask what about video games specifically makes them more compelling than historical leisure activities.</p>



<h3 id="decreasing-cost-increasing-availability-and-increasing-quality-of-media-entertainment">Decreasing Cost, Increasing Availability, and Increasing Quality of Media Entertainment</h3>

<p>Video games are just one example of media entertainment content that has become more a more attractive leisure choice as a result of advances in internet and mobile device technology.</p>

<p>For most of history, media consumption was bounded, like other forms of consumption, by cost – if you wanted more books, movies, music, console video games, etc, you needed money to buy them. Notable exceptions to this pattern were radio and cable television, where you could access programming at all hours of the day for a low fixed cost (or in some cases for free) – but in these cases, limits on the syndication of premium content entailed that not every hour of watching was equally enjoyable, and there were generally still diminishing (enjoyment) returns on each additional hour spent watching.</p>

<p>The digitization of content enabled infinite storage of evergreen content in the cloud and effectively zero marginal distribution cost of content through copying. Enabling on-demand access to all of the content that has ever been produced entailed a huge increase in the supply of good content. This essentially made all of history a viable competitor to people producing new content. Similarly, social media–produced for free, by amateurs–provided another huge influx of new content and more competition for attention.</p>

<p>This increased supply and competition put pressure on professionals creating new content to make it better and cheaper. On top of that, taking a page from the cable TV playbook, internet media distributors gave away content for free, and used advertising subsidies to pay for the small amount of content that was still being professionally produced.</p>

<p>All of these changes benefited the consumer by making more and better content available for free. Today, you can pretty much always spend yet another hour consuming some new and interesting content freely available on the internet, so once you have paid the (quite cheap) cost of access to your ISP or mobile data provider, you no longer require additional wages to pay for additional consumption of media as a leisure activity.</p>

<h3 id="decreasing-signalling-utility-of-conspicuous-consumption-goods">Decreasing Signalling Utility of Conspicuous Consumption Goods</h3>

<p>Before we accept that young men are simply foregoing working in favor of spending more time playing video games or consuming other forms of media entertainment content, we should ask what else they might spend foregone earnings on and why they are not working to fund that spend.</p>

<p>In general there are three types of goods: goods that meet your basic needs, leisure goods (including media goods), and conspicuous consumption goods (those that signal genetic fitness, social status, belonging, etc.). If young men playing video games are not foregoing their basic needs (an assumption we’ll make here), and the cost of media entertainment goods has dramatically fallen, then they must be trading off consumption goods. Next, we argue that this group has decreased consumption because the signaling utility of these goods has decreased.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-conspicuous-consumption-and-what-does-it-take-to-get-it">What is conspicuous consumption and what does it take to get it?</h4>

<p>Historically, the primary purpose of working was to generate enough income to satisfy basic needs. Once those needs were met, an individual had a tradeoff to make between spending their remaining time on work or leisure.</p>

<p>Observing the behavior of the nouveau riche in a post-industrialization society in the late 1800s, Thorstein Veblen introduced the theory of conspicuous consumption - the purchase of goods and services for the sake of signalling social status (vs. the intrinsic function provided by goods that meet basic needs or those that enable leisure).</p>

<p>As living standards improved in the 20th century and individuals had more discretionary income, this behavior expanded to men, women, and children across all economic classes who began to spend more money on goods and services as a sort of social fashion. Implicit in spending more time on work is a preference for conspicuous consumption over leisure.</p>

<p>If you have the money, how do you decide what to consume? Benjamin Schwarz suggested in his <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-new-elites-silly-virtue-signaling-consumption/">review</a> of Elizabeth Currid-Halkett’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Small-Things-Theory-Aspirational/dp/0691162735">The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This process depends on the great extent to which the elite’s consumption is at once devoted to and relies on “cultural capital”—that is, the adoption of values, tastes, and norms through social inculcation and formal education. That cup of Intelligentsia coffee may “only” cost five dollars, but learning about it in the first place depends on prizing the judgment of certain cultural tastemakers (again, say, the New York Times and those right-thinking podcasts), and on possessing a worldview that attaches a particular value and virtue to a particular container of hot liquid. Acquiring that cultural capital is, itself, a rarefied and usually expensive endeavor, because it involves a lengthy and complex process of what the sociologists call cultural and social formation: The peculiar cachet that the educated class attaches to that cup of coffee is far more likely to elude the daughter of an insurance adjuster brought up in Lansing, Kansas (a middle-class suburb of Kansas City), who attended the local high school and Kansas State, than it is the daughter of a screenwriter raised in uber-achieving north-of-Montana-Avenue Santa Monica, who attended the Harvard-Westlake School and Yale. Thus, buying that cup of coffee—or that organic cotton t-shirt, or that subscription to Harper’s—signifies a class identity that the purchase, in turn, reinforces.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The increased cost in time to acquire the knowledge of what to consume is yet another way that conspicuous consumption is becoming prohibitively more expensive.</p>

<p>The catch with all of this is that the psychological utility sought from conspicuous consumption is relative, not absolute. Sarah Perry sums this up nicely in her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290">Every Cradle is a Grave</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than anything, however, a human utility function is a function of social belonging. That’s the ultimate point not only of income, but of intelligence, beauty, and many other material and non-material goods: they may be traded for social belonging… We want income because we want to be able to get the attention of others. We want a safe social place, primarily—and, of course, we want a better social place than the one we currently occupy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication of this relative sizing up is that there is an ever-rising bar to maintain or improve your social position relative to the people and communities from which you seek affiliation or belonging. This was never easy given the money and time required, but at least …</p></article></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>

Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Ever since&nbsp;Google&nbsp;published the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" target="_blank">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) book</a>&nbsp;in 2016, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="SRE movemen (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/06/26/cloud-service-reliability-part-i-apollo-13-to-google-sre/" target="_blank">SRE movemen</a>t has changed how organizations look at&nbsp;reliability, and incident response and management. Not unlike DevOps, working on adopting SRE is resulting in an organizational cultural shift. A shift which is changing how organizations are organized, on how information flows within an organization that would allow for the delivery of more reliable and resilient, dynamic systems. That being said, SRE, that is SRE as defined by Google, is not applicable for most organizations. Organizations need to take the thought process and culture behind Google’s SRE and adapt it just enough to make it suitable and viable for their organization’s business needs. As I see it today, large enterprises are mostly failing at doing this. They are either attempting to adopt SRE in its purest form, not realizing they are not Google, or totally changing (corrupting) it to suit how they do things, how they have always done things, to their broken culture, hence making what they call SRE, SRE in name only.</p>



<blockquote><p>“But, You are Not Google”</p><cite>Me talking to many a CIO/VP of Ops</cite></blockquote>



<p>“But, You are not Google”. This is a common refrain I have said to many a CIO or VP of Ops in companies that I have worked on SRE adoption with. I try to be polite, I promise. But really, they are not Google. In the very initial pages of the Google SRE book, in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/production-environment/" target="_blank">introduction</a> itself, the authors describes why Google developed SRE. They have massive data centers on which their services run. These data centers have a high incidence of hardware failure, given their size. This required Google to have the ability to dynamically move services from one part of the data center to another in a fraction of time. Given the large user base of the deployed services, Google also needed to have extremely fast response times to outages and degradation in quality of service, with minimal impact to the user. Their operations teams had to find a way to handle all these incidents, outages and failures in an automated manner to reduce toil and stress on the team. Their incidents, outages and failures were also very repetitive. Given the homogenous nature of the hardware across their datacenters, and the nature of the services deployed, there were very few outliers. Most tasks could (should) be automated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This led to the development of what we today know as SRE. Google had a team of software developers work in operations with the goal of developing software to handle the vast majority of tasks that were assigned to the system administration teams and incident response teams. As the software got more and more mature, more and more typical tasks had been automated. The humans could then focus on the outliers. On tasks that were not ‘typical’. Reliability Engineering meets software engineering = SRE.</p>



<p>If the 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph in this section is not an apt description of your datacenters and systems you are running, you do not need SRE. Don’t get me wrong, you need (service/system) Reliability Engineering. You still need to automate repetitive, typical tasks in operations. You just don’t need to, and really should not do it the Google way. You are not Google. Very few organizations are.</p>



<h3><strong>SRE for the Enterprise</strong></h3>



<p>So what does SRE in the ‘regular’ Enterprise look like? It may be easier to describe what it does not look like. Here goes:</p>



<ul><li>You are not replacing your current Ops team, your sys admins with software Engineers. You need your ops team. They know how your custom built infrastructure and systems work. They know its idiosyncrasies. They know when Chicago opens to a ticket to say they are offline again, its the network. Yes, its always the network, but the sysadmins know who to ping at Equinix to get it restored pronto. They know how the option trade desk system slows to a grind on Expiration Friday and you just ignore those tickets from traders that day. And even if you wanted to get rid of all the sys admins, can you afford to hire that many software engineers to replace them all? You can barely fill all your open slots on the dev teams. What you need to do is complement your Ops teams with software engineers who can understand what the teams do day-in, day-out and what tasks are repetitive and typical, and then they can develop tools for automated remediation. These software engineers should be embedded in the ops team, not a separate team on the outside. Think <em>Squads.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE is a no-no.&nbsp;First of all <em>&lt;steps on soapbox/&gt;</em> there should NOT be a team called the DevOps team! You created a new silo to do what was supposed to be a movement to eliminate silos? DevOps should be what everyone does. If you do have a separate team to build automation, that is exactly what they are – the automation building team. And that is exactly what they should do – build automation for others to use. They build tools to enable the processes of DevOps. They do NOT use those tools themselves to do any real deployments. Ever. But I leave my true feelings on this for another blog post <em>&lt;steps off soapbox/&gt;</em>.&nbsp; Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE only gets them to leave for better jobs as real SREs elsewhere at better salaries now that they are formally SREs according to their resumes. Don’t do it. DevOps is DevOps. SRE is SRE. They are joined at the hip, but they are different. SREs have a different set of goals from the application development teams – build automation to reduce toil, increase observability, and improve reliability of the systems in production. They should not be building deployment automation or improving test environments to get better quality signals.</li></ul>
</div></div>



<ul><li>SRE is first and foremost about culture. Do you have a culture that is reliability focussed? What does reliability mean to you? Is it <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/08/18/cloud-service-reliability-part-3-antifragile-when-devops-met-sre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MTBF or MTTR (opens in a new tab)">MTBF or MTTR</a>? Do you have well defined SLAs (or SLOs)? How do you measure them? Do you meet them? Do you have <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2020/01/08/understanding-observability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Observability (opens in a new tab)">Observability</a>? Do you do blameless postmortems of incidents? Are they really blameless? Do you make your developers ‘carry pagers’ and do they do it without fear? Do you deploy on Fridays and sleep well over the weekend?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>I am barely scratching the surface of how SRE needs to be adapted for the enterprise (that is not Google). I would like to hear from you. But instead of leaving a comment on this post, which I perfectly OK with, I would prefer you respond to an <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">SRE survey</a> we recently created. I had the opportunity earlier this year to work with three good friends of mine – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA2fPwBkGJsFLhm7pYTiGv1hOwqc3Vxt1I/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Marc Hornbeek</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADGJN4BvhODuicPVGeQAljiRCR_Vx66MQM/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Archana Joshi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAJS7zgBfhzivo8mNgusFqmaicqG0wuPYww/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Niladri Choudhury</a> on a <em><a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">State of SRE</a></em> survey commissioned by <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/">Catchpoint</a>. This survey is designed specifically to get a view into how enterprises and other organization not named Google are adopting SRE. If your organization is adopting or thinking of adopting SRE, do take this survey right now. We will be analyzing the results and sharing findings on the current state and trends (this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year Catchpoint is running a SRE survey) later this Spring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sweeten the deal, I am offering my time to anyone who completes the survey and wants to talk SRE. Once you complete the survey and want to talk about your SRE adoption or just have questions about SRE, <a href="mailto:sanjeev@sdarchtect.blog">email a screenshot of the completion screen to me</a> and I will schedule a <strong>free 20-minute consult with you and your team</strong>. So, what are you waiting for – click <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">here</a> to go to the survey. I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

<p>Stripe Atlas is a <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">“platform for forming a company”</a> aimed in particular at startups and internet businesses. It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>

- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/should-i-pay-taxes-again/13738">“I paid taxes four months ago. I just got an email saying I have to pay again.”</a>
</section>

<h2 id="azlo-banking-option">Azlo Banking Option</h2>
<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>
<h2 id="other-stripe-resources">Other Stripe Resources</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources we’ve found useful. They run the gamut from the official sources for some of the technologies we’ve mentioned to particularly good community discussions around common issues.</p>

        <h2>About Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
        <p>
          A matrix of size <span>m × n</span> is a grid of real numbers consisting of <span>m</span> rows and <span>n</span> columns.
          In linear algebra, a branch of mathematics, matrices of size <span>m × n</span> describe linear mappings from <span>n</span>-dimensional to <span>m</span>-dimensional space.
          The word linear roughly means that straight lines map to straight lines and the origin in <span>n</span>‑dimensional space maps to the origin in <span>m</span>‑dimensional space.
          When we have an <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix <span>A</span> and a <span>(n × k)</span>‑matrix <span>B</span>, we can compute the product <span>AB</span> which is an <span>(m × k)</span>‑matrix.
          The mapping corresponding to <span>AB</span> is exactly the composition of the mappings corresponding to <span>A</span> and <span>B</span> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</a> (SVD) states that every <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix <span>A</span> can be written as a product
        </p>
        
        <p>
          where <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> are orthogonal matrices and the the matrix <span>Σ</span> consists of descending non-negative values on its diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
          The entries <span>σ<sub>1</sub> ≥ σ<sub>2</sub> ≥ σ<sub>3</sub> ≥ … ≥ 0</span> on the diagonal of <span>Σ</span> are called the <em>singular values</em> (SVs) of <span>A</span>.
          Geometrically, <span>Σ</span> maps the <span>j</span>‑th unit coordinate vector of <span>n</span>‑dimensional space to the <span>j</span>‑th coordinate vector of <span>m</span>‑dimensional space, scaled by the factor <span>σ<sub>j</sub></span>.
          Orthogonality of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> means that they correspond to rotations (possibly followed by a reflection) of <span>m</span>‑dimensional and <span>n</span>‑dimensional space respectively.
          Therefore only <span>Σ</span> changes the length of vectors.
        </p>
        <h2>Using SVD for image compression</h2>
        <p>
          We can decompose a given image into the three color channels red, green and blue.
          Each channel can be represented as a <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix with values ranging from 0 to 255.
          We will now compress the matrix <span>A</span> representing one of the channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, we compute an approximation to the matrix <span>A</span> that takes only a fraction of the space to store.
          Now here's the great thing about SVD: the data in the matrices <span>U</span>, <span>Σ</span> and <span>V</span> is sorted by how much it contributes to the matrix <span>A</span> in the product.
          That enables us to get quite a good approximation by simply using only the most important parts of the matrices.
        </p>
      </div><div>
        <p>
          We now choose a number <span>k</span> of singular values that we are going to use for the approximation.
          The higher this number, the better the quality of the approximation gets but also the more data is needed to encode it.
          We now take only the first <span>k</span> columns of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> and the upper left <span>(k × k)</span>-square of <span>Σ</span>, containing the <span>k</span> largest (and therefore most important) singular values.
          We then have
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The amount of data needed to store this approximation is proportional to the colored area:
        </p>
        <p>
          compressed size = <span>m × k</span> + <span>k</span> + <span>k × n</span> = k × (<span>1</span> + <span>m</span> + <span>n</span>)
        </p>
        <p>
          (Actually, slightly less space is needed due to the orthogonality of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span>.)
          One can prove that this approximation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_approximation#Basic_low-rank_approximation_problem" title="Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem">optimal in a certain sense</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demo lets you choose the number of singular values <span>k</span> and see how this choice affects the quality of the approximation and the compression rate.
          Notice how for all photographs, the graph showing the singular values looks like a hyperbola: there are only a few really large SVs and a long tail of relatively smaller SVs.
          In contrast, for the random noise image the graph of SVs looks roughly linear.
        </p>
        <p>
          SVD is routinely used in statistics for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal component analysis</a> and in numerical simulations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction">reducing the order of models</a>.
          For image compression, more sophisticated methods like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_uNPbdenRs">JPG</a> that take human perception into account generally outperform compression using SVD.
        </p>
        <h2>About this demo</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://www.netlib.org/clapack/">CLAPACK</a> library provides the algorithm for computing the SVD.
          Since CLAPACK is a C library (it is a translation of the Fortran library LAPACK) we use <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">emscripten</a> to translate it to JavaScript/asm.js.
          The SVDs of all three color channels are computed in parallel on the client-side using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker">web workers</a>.
          To provide the quick preview, we use <a href="https://research.facebook.com/blog/294071574113354/fast-randomized-svd/">a randomized algorithm</a> to compute an approximate truncated SVD with 50 singular values.

          The user interface uses <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/akiran/react-slick">react-slick</a> and <a href="http://refreshless.com/nouislider/">noUiSlider</a>.
          Thanks to the creators of all these great projects!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this media release used a hypothetical example that suggested that Google used information about users’ health to personalise or target advertisements. Google says that it does not show personalised ads based on health information. This example has been removed from the media release.</em></p>

<p>The ACCC has launched Federal Court proceedings against Google LLC (Google), alleging Google misled Australian consumers to obtain their consent to expand the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine about consumers’ internet activity, for use by Google, including for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges Google misled consumers when it failed to properly inform consumers, and did not gain their explicit informed consent, about its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers’ Google accounts with information about those individuals’ activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.</p>

<p>This meant this data about users’ non-Google online activity became linked to their names and other identifying information held by Google. Previously, this information had been kept separately from users’ Google accounts, meaning the data was not linked to an individual user.</p>

<p>Google then used this newly combined information to improve the commercial performance of its advertising businesses.</p>

<p>The ACCC also alleges that Google misled consumers about a related change to its privacy policy.</p>

<p>“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Google significantly increased the scope of information it collected about consumers on a personally identifiable basis. This included potentially very sensitive and private information about their activities on third party websites. It then used this information to serve up highly targeted advertisements without consumers’ express informed consent,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from consumers to take this step.”</p>

<p>“The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits.”</p>

<p>“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the “price” of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>“I agree” notification</strong></p>

<p>The conduct is alleged to have impacted millions of Australians with Google accounts.</p>

<p>From 28 June 2016 until at least December 2018, Google account holders were prompted to click “I agree” to a pop-up notification from Google that purported to explain how it planned to combine their data, and sought the consumers’ consent for this.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>Some new features for your Google Account</em></p>

	<p><em>We’ve introduced some optional features for your account, giving you more control over the data Google collects and how it’s used, while allowing Google to show you more relevant ads.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notification also stated,&nbsp;<em>“More information will be available in your Google Account making it easier for you to review and control”</em>; and&nbsp;<em>“Google will use this information to make ads across the web more relevant for you.”</em></p>

<p>Before June 2016, Google only collected and used, for advertising purposes, personally identifiable information about Google account users’ activities on Google owned services and apps like Google Search and YouTube.</p>

<p>After June 2016, when consumers clicked on the “I agree” notification, Google began to collect and store a much wider range of personally identifiable information about the online activities of Google account holders, including their use of third-party sites and apps not owned by Google.</p>

<p>Previously, this additional data had been stored separately from a user’s Google account.</p>

<p>Combined with the personal data stored in Google accounts, this provided Google with valuable information with which to sell even more targeted advertising, including through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that the “I agree” notification was misleading, because consumers could not have properly understood the changes Google was making nor how their data would be used, and so did not - and could not - give informed consent.</p>

<p>“We believe that many consumers, if given an informed choice, may have refused Google permission to combine and use such a wide array of their personal information for Google’s own financial benefit,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy policy change</strong></p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google stated in its privacy policy that it&nbsp;<em>“will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.”</em></p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, Google deleted this statement and inserted the following statement:<em>&nbsp;“[d]epending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.”</em></p>

<p>Google’s privacy policy also states:&nbsp;<em>“[w]e will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.”</em></p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that Google did not in fact obtain consumers’ explicit consent for this change to the privacy policy, and that Google’s statement that it would not reduce consumers’ rights without their explicit consent was therefore misleading.</p>

<p>“Google made a clear representation about how it would protect users’ privacy. The ACCC alleges that Google made changes without obtaining the explicit consent it had promised consumers it would obtain before altering how it protected their private information,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick</strong></p>

<p>In 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick, a supplier of ad-serving technology services to publishers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Google now supplies DoubleClick’s services through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands, which are the leading suppliers of ad-tech intermediary services.</p>

<p>These services track users’ internet activity on third-party sites that display ads through the use of DoubleClick’s advertising technology.</p>

<p>Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick required approval by competition authorities including the US Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. The ACCC also reviewed and cleared this transaction.</p>

<p>FTC and EC cleared the acquisition, and in doing so considered submissions from Google that it would not be able to combine DoubleClick’s data on consumers’ internet activity with its own data about consumers’ activity on Google services because, at the time, DoubleClick’s contracts with its users prevented Google from doing so.</p>

<p>The agencies did not, however, rely on these submissions in clearing the acquisition.</p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google collected and stored this information on a non-personally identifiable basis, as stated in its privacy policy.</p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, it changed its privacy policy by removing the term explaining how it would treat this DoubleClick data.</p>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the device and Google service being used by the consumer, the notification published by Google from 28 June 2016 was presented in a variety of ways. A copy of the notification in the form published to consumers using desktop devices is provided below for reference.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I bit the bullet and reformatted my MacBook Pro over the weekend. My motivation for doing this was to start from scratch to figure out what apps I need. I’m documenting the process I followed here. This guide is a work-in-progress.</p>



<h3>Backing Up My Files</h3>



<p>I wanted to keep it simple and work on organizing all of my files later. So I used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bombich.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> to do the hard work with backing up all my files over to my Drobo 5N. This took longer than I expected, so be patient.</p>



<h3>Signing Out</h3>



<p>You’ll need to make sure you sign out and deauthorize applications before you reformat.</p>



<h3>Installing Applications and Configuring</h3>



<p>Since I’m a developer, I’m always on the lookout for MacBook setup guides. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/" target="_blank">this</a> impressive guide by Tania Rascia and was inspired to make my own. </p>



<p>After installing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, here are the apps I installed.</p>



<pre><code>brew install \
  git \
  yarn \
  make 

brew cask install 1password bartender brave-browser carbon-copy-cloner cleanmymac cleanshot screenflow visual-studio-code google-chrome firefox iterm2 docker vlc slack keybase postgres postico postman coda malwarebytes steam dotnet-sdk
</code></pre>



<p>Since I needed to install Mac Store apps, I installed and used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas" target="_blank">mas-cli</a>.</p>



<pre><code>brew install mas</code></pre>



<pre><code>mas install 937984704 1091189122 775737590 634148309 441258766 1274495053 568494494 485812721 497799835

# Amphetamine
# Bear
# iA Writer  
# Logic Pro X
# Magnet
# Microsoft To Do 
# Pocket
# TweetDeck
# Xcode</code></pre>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cask-versions</a> to install alternative versions of applications that I haven’t upgraded like Alfred.</p>



<pre><code>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions</code></pre>



<pre><code>brew cask install alfred3 # then activated my power pack license</code></pre>



<p>Turn off spotlight keyboard shortcut and set keyboard shortcut to <code>CMD + spacebar</code> for Alfred.</p>



<h3>iTerm2 Setup</h3>



<p>I followed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070" target="_blank">this</a> to setup my iTerm2.</p>



<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>



<pre><code>{
    "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",
    "workbench.colorTheme": "New Moon",
    "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",
    "terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/bin/zsh",
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF",
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "terminal.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminal.background": "#002833",
        "terminal.ansiBlack": "#003541",
        "terminal.ansiBlue": "#268bd2",
        "terminal.ansiCyan": "#2aa198",
        "terminal.ansiGreen": "#859901",
        "terminal.ansiMagenta": "#d33682",
        "terminal.ansiRed": "#dc322f",
        "terminal.ansiWhite": "#eee8d5",
        "terminal.ansiYellow": "#b58901",
        "terminal.ansiBrightBlack": "#586e75",
        "terminal.ansiBrightBlue": "#839496",
        "terminal.ansiBrightCyan": "#93a1a1",
        "terminal.ansiBrightGreen": "#586e75",

        "terminal.ansiBrightRed": "#cb4b16",
        "terminal.ansiBrightWhite": "#fdf6e3",
        "terminal.ansiBrightYellow": "#657b83",
        "terminalCursor.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminalCursor.background": "#003541"
    }
}</code></pre>



<h3>Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects</h3>



<p>I recommend using Stuart Ellis’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/#setting-up-a-directory-structure-for-projects" target="_blank">directory structure</a> for projects, which looks like this for me.</p>



<pre><code>code/
  src/
    github.com/
      westerncj/
        a-project/
    gitlab.com/
      cwestern/
        b-project/</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Over the month, the Netflix’s show “The Last Dance” featuring Michael Jordan’s last year in the bull’s NBA team helped to shine light of his victory and success in his time to the public. Personally as a basketball lover, I’ve always followed him and his amazing story since the beginning of the internet era (I’m serious!). However, getting to 2 years into my software engineering journey helped me see different principles from his life that I could apply into my tech journey. In this post, I’ve decided to share with you all 6 lessons for the 6 championships that MJ has gotten in his career.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>1. Competitive: there is this need for him to win!</h2>

<p>Here’s this short video that simply puts this competitive aspect of him across clearly!</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>As we can see from his life and the especially in the most recent show that came out “The Last Dance”, we could see how he is competitive on almost every aspect of life. From the game of basketball to the game of golf and to tossing coin that is the nearest to the wall.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mike will compete with anything, though. If we’re drinking water, Mike will be like, ‘I’ll race you!’”<br>
Source:&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the lesson I’ve learnt from him to apply into my software engineer journey: Apart from short once-off games such as a casual golf match, or one-on-one basketball matches, many times in technology, the way to show success over another company or implementation is long term. It isn’t a short fight, every technology solution requires time and effort to implement. But the key take away isn’t to compete with companies, more often than not, you can find yourself collaborating such there both parties can win. I guess the key takeaway is that sense of self confidence. When you first start off your blogging venture like I did, you look into the industry and you start seeing all the successful blogs with million views and high passive income. And you wonder how can you even compare? The message we can take away from Michael Jordan is that attitude that never backs down. You may be the under-dog today but you do not have to stay this way, and you can deliberately choose to be better than what you are now.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. Passion was his fuel. Pour your love into everything you do.</h2>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bMmvIxxADg2PenWvuEErUUJIsA8=/0x0:3029x2033/1820x1213/filters:focal(1066x671:1550x1155):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66666326/101527P_MICHAEL_JORDAN_BULLS.0.jpg" alt=""><em>Michael Jordan crying as he won his first championship</em><br>
￼</p></div>
<p>Here’s a short video that managed to capture the emotions that was building in that locker room after the victory that night.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir0-t5Yfq-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>There’s just so much emotions, energy, and heart placed into this game. From the story of him being cut from his high school basketball team that hurt him over the summer. He decided to pour his heart and do his absolute best to get back onto the team. It has been 7 years since he entered NBA and to finally be able to reach to the top through the many years. Even as Michael cried holding that trophy, there was just so much passion and emotions put into whatever he did.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>”I’ve been waiting seven years for this and I thank God for blessing us to make it possible,”</p>
<p>”This is the happiest moment of my life,” Jordan said. “We did it. We did it as a team. I’ve been fighting to hold back my emotions all week. But I knew we would win it tonight and I knew my emotions would get the best of me. I’m just happy.”<br>
Jordan said.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Heart is what separates the great from the good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, I do see parallel behaviors among the giants even in the technology scene as well. We can see that from the life of Steve Jobs. Here’s an article that briefly talked about his stroy.</p>
<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/11/why-steve-jobs-cried/">Why Steve Jobs cried</a></p>

<p>The main point isn’t to cry over every thing that happened but to talk about that deep sense of passion and heart in what you do. I guess such a level of passion in any tasks or goal speaks more of the dedication that person has as an individual than about the seriousness of the task.</p>

<p>If you want to excel into any industry, you got to have that passion that pushes you beyond the boundaries to explore what could be beyond this limit. This is all the more true in the technology industry where all these technologies advancing with new updates or releases. In order to keep up, you got to have that sense of curiosity to find out what the industry has done to solve all the different problems you have. Only when you have that sense of curiosity then can you want to go out there to find out what are these technology giants doing. Let me give you an illustration:</p>

<p>Here’s a <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">Roadmap for devops engineer</a>. It basically charts out for you the set of learnings or knowledge you should know or master if you ever chooses to walk down this path of being a devOps engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Just look at the amount of technology in one single page</strong>. And each box properly takes an individual years to master, and some even pursue just one box their entire career. If you did not have any interest or deep passion for the tools out there, you will probably just ignore most of that because you could just make do with the tools you already know to ‘hack’ your way to a solution.</p>

<p>The successful techies are not always the oldest, but more often than not, you find in these people a deep sense of curiosity and passion for the technology. The way they describe technology almost always sound like they are describing a friend you have to got to know on a daily basis. And one day, I aspire to be like one of them as well (:</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Focused on what he wants to do. And actually go get it</h2>

<p>One common trait among all great players or individuals that we know of, Warran buffet, Steve jobs, and Michael Jordan: They had laser sharp focus on what they want to do.</p>

<p>The focus to improve is not found on the court. What you see on the court in public’s view was merely the outcome of the grind behind closed doors in the gym. The focus to improve starts in the gym behind closed doors and far from media. He made sure to practice harder than that he played. That intensity of personal practice allowed him to create that familiarity and comfort zone during game time, and all he had to do was the react to what his body was already accustomed to do. He focused on getting his fundamentals right. Focused to perfect the small things that noone seem to notice. People only saw the outcome of that focus to little details.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing the little things until perfection becomes a habit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zSVu76AX3I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>Many times people chase after the shiniest objects in the technology space - AI, Automation, Machine Learning. In the act of chasing, people lose sight of the fundamentals - understanding the business problem or creating product and services that business actually need or even simply just focusing on writing clean, testable, and readable code. While articles about AI and Machine learning may create some wows, it is the seemingly dull and ‘boring’ habits of consistently writing code, learning about good coding practices that sharpens your fundamentals. When it is crunch time, you will find yourself well equipped to shine in your work. These little act of grinding can be attending online courses to learn more about courses that does hands-on projects with you.</p>

<p>One such course is <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pluralsight.com/">Plural sight</a>. They have really detailed courses with instructors that will guide you through the fundamentals of what you are learning, impart the best practices and share their learning in a walkthrough guide that you can do alongside them. Another will be udemy. Check those out.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>When you practice daily and deliberately, you will find yourself ready when the next challenge or problem comes your way.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>4. Together we can do more: he has a close group of people to keep him grounded</h2>

<p>People do not usually see this aspect of him when we hear of the great Michael Jordan. Many instances, I’ve noticed from all the videos, he always had the support of his parents and siblings when he hits rock bottom. Even during the first championship, his dad was present there alongside him. And was also there to deal with backlashes about MJ’s gambling habits.</p>

<p>Imagine the devastation to know that your strong support was taken away just like that.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GG5xXWHyq9g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you want to go far, you have to go together as a team. Over the years, I’ve came to understand that if we want to solve problems that are bigger than ourselves - societal issues, you have to have a team alongside you. You have your strength to offer to the table, but rarely do we see how our strengths alone is able to bring a holistic solution. Yes, you may be an amazing god-like engineer that can replicate another google. Even with all the knowledge in the world, you lack the one resource you cannot buy - time. Everyone of us needs one another. In technology, the ability to come together with our different skills and collaborate opens up door of opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Know how to respond to failure: failure is the only way to success</h2>

<p>Michael Jordan did not fear the spot light. He did not shy away from the crunch time. When it was time for the bulls team to take the final score, it goes to him without a question. But that illusion of ‘success since birth’ did not start that way. He was not always a winner. There is this famous quote from him:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JA7G7AV-LT8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>It is always easy to make sense of all these failures on hindsight - this is called the hindsight bias, where the decisions and circumstances you faced seems like an invisible ink before the good outcome, but plain as day after the outcome as if a fool would have missed it.</p>

<p>Similarly in technology, as you start off, you will find yourself deep into the unknown; overwhelmed with unfamiliarity regarding the technology you have to deal with in order to deliver the solution. You make mistakes in your earlier days and thus causing scalability issues when the solution starts to scale to hundreds of people. Since that feature is implemented by you, these mistakes and bugs are starting to …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-8a4d83837a563922fa44"><p>One of the most challenging aspects of starting and maintaining a business, regardless of whether you are a freelancer or a conglomerate, is determining the right price to charge for your services.&nbsp; If you are an economist, the ideal price is simply the point at which demand meets supply.  If a price is too high the demand for the service will go down thereby resulting in excess supply or capacity by the service provider.  If the  price is too low then demand will increasing leaving the supplier less availability to meet demand.  Of course, pricing can be significantly more complex than this and has become a lot more sophisticated in recent years.   Businesses pay thousands of dollars to pricing consultants for strategies that take numerous factors into consideration when determining pricing.  One only has to look to airlines as example of a seemingly inscrutable pricing model.  Unfortunately, smaller businesses, freelancers and startups don’t usually have the budget for a pricing strategist and have to make do by searching for information available on the internet, discussing it with their business associates  or simply using their gut to come up with something that makes sense.  As an internet source, I have set out a strategy for determining a price for your services </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1439256306507_6993"><div><h3><strong>Calculate Baseline Pricing for Your Services</strong></h3><p>A good starting point is to determine how much you could earn if you were employed either full time or part time, and translate this to an hourly rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is a calculator to help you determine your hourly rate based on a full time salary:</p><p><strong>Annual Salary</strong> estimate for an employee doing the same job </p><p><strong>Annual Tax Benefits Paid By Employer</strong> including <a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/understanding-payroll-deductions-personal-income-tax-rates-c.html">Payroll taxes such as CPP, QPIP, QHSF</a> as well as group insurance, automobile allowance,<a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/guidelines-for-deducting-conference-and-training-expenses"> professional development</a> etc.  This is usually calculated as 10-15% of your salary.</p><p><strong>Annual Estimated </strong><a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/20-essential-tax-facts-for-small-business-owners.html"><strong>Expenses</strong> of running the business</a> could include rent, supplies, direct expenses of supplying the service, subcontractors, subscriptions, office supplies etc.</p><p><strong>Number of WEEKLY TOTAL hours </strong>that you plan to work in your business .  This is usually 35-40 hours if you plan to work full time but can also be less if you only plan to work part time.</p><p><strong>Number of WEEKLY Hours Spent on Administration&nbsp;</strong> represents a variety of <a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/the-many-hats-of-self-employment.html">administrative tasks such as marketing, accounting, sales, IT, updating your website </a>etc. that can take up a significant amount of time but for which you can’t specifically charge your clients.  Instead this is built into your hourly rate. </p><p><strong>Number of Weeks&nbsp;<em>Per Year</em></strong>&nbsp;Working on Business can be anywhere up to 52 weeks.  If you want to take 4 weeks of vacation per year, this number would be 48 weeks.</p><h3><strong>HOURLY RATE CALCULATOR FOR BUSINESS SERVICES:</strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594594020315_43906"><div><p>Using the calculator above, if you were to work 40 hours a week, you would need to charge $37.50 an hour to earn an amount that is approximately equivalent to $50,000 a year. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Compare the Baseline Hourly Rate to Competitors and other sources</strong></h3><p>In order to identify the competition, you should search for similar business with comparable service offerings and determine pricing for their services.  You will likely find a wide range of pricing which is influenced by where you are located, how much experience you have, the breadth of services that you are able to offer including complementary services (eg. offering web development along with web hosting).  Once you have an idea of what the fees are for their services, you can see how your own baseline compares.  </p><p>It can also be useful to speak to colleagues, other business owners and post on business related message boards/sub-reddits etc. to try and glean what a reasonable rate is for the services that you are providing.  Other sources include UpWork, Fiverr and other freelance websites where people often post their services that will provide more of a range.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594594020588_38801"><div><h3><strong>Determine how you are going to differentiate your services from your competitors</strong></h3><p>Since almost every existing service is already being provided by someone else and your competition is no longer only businesses in your area, but anyone who is willing to work remotely, it is essential that you think about what differentiates you and your service offerings from the other businesses in your space.&nbsp; There are numerous ways of differentiating yourself:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Offer a complimentary service to every client that signs up with you, </p></li><li><p>Personalize the services to meet your clients needs.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Have a unique pricing structure that is based on results (see discussion on pricing below)</p></li><li><p>Create a loyalty program</p></li><li><p>Offer a money back guarantee if they are not satisfied</p></li><li><p>Write articles that highlight your expertise or create an app that is useful to your target market</p></li></ul><p>Once you have honed in on what differentiates your service offerings, you need to be able to communicate this effectively to your potential clients.  This will allow them to see the value in your services.  Although, many businesses particularly, when they are first starting out, feel that they have to compete on price, this could not be further from the truth.  Often potential customers will shy away from the lowest cost option as this might suggest lower quality.  Also, they are looking to solve a problem and many business owners know from experience that going with the cheapest provider who ultimately can’t provide them with the service they need, can end up being more costly in the long run.</p><h3><strong>come up with a pricing strategy for your services</strong></h3><p>There are essentially two ways you can price your services:</p><p><strong>Hourly Based Pricing</strong></p><p>Perhaps  the most popular method by which business price their services is on an hourly basis.  The benefit of hourly pricing is that it is simple to implement and to track.  Clients will often expect to pay an hourly rate and therefore it is an easier sell.  The downside of pricing on an hourly basis is that clients  are often (unpleasantly) surprised by the amount of time a job may take which requires justification and often requires that you reduce your price just to keep them happy.  The other significant downside is that, to paraphrase <a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Ronald Baker</a> , you have created a ceiling on how much you can charge.  This means that since you only have a limited amount of time, there is a maximum amount that you can earn which is the number of hours worked times X your hourly rate.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Value Based Pricing</a></p><p>Simply speaking, value based pricing is the price that you would charge to a customer based on the value that they perceive.  A great example of this would be a painting by Van Gogh.  If you were to take the cost of materials and labour (his hourly rate would have been very low in his lifetime), the painting would sell for a few hundred dollars. Using the value pricing model, his painting “<em>The Portrait of Doctor Gachet” </em>sold for more than $80 million, which was the value of the painting to the purchaser.  Sadly, most of us cannot charge $80 million for our services.  However, it does underline the point that customers might be willing to pay more for our services as long as we can demonstrate their value to them.  </p><p>Demonstrating value can be done in a variety of ways.  One example would be to show a customer how your web development service where you implement an online shopping app will directly increase their revenues.  A pricing structure can be created whereby you charge the customer for the percentage of increase in revenues or it can be a hybrid of a fixed price for the project + a percentage of sales.  Another example would be to communicate to them on how your accounting service will help them to reduce their interest and penalties by ensuring that tax returns are filed or debt payments are made on a timely basis. A third example would be a collection service that promises to improve the collection of customer receivables by 25% thereby increasing the customer’s cash flow.  </p><p>All of these are examples of services that could be highly valuable to a client.  The goal for the business service provider is to put a value on how much these services are worth and charge that price.  The benefits of the value pricing model is that the customer knows exactly how much they are going to pay up front so there are no surprises and the price of the service can be quite a bit higher than simply charging the hourly rate than the number of hours.  The downside is that you have to effectively communicate to your client the value of your service.  Also,  there might be unforeseen issues or it might end up taking much longer than you anticipated.  </p><p>Using value based pricing requires that you essentially provide a pre-determined price, that you and your client agree on, for a project or ongoing service.  An excellent resource on the subject can be in found in <a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Ronald Baker’s book on value pricing</a>.  Once you have calculated how much you are going to charge, you can bill your client once certain milestones have been reached, all at once or for ongoing services on a monthly basis.  It can also be very useful to provide a client with different options (usually 3 options) to choose from which increases the likelihood that they will choose one of the options.  (This is a variation on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> where simple probability suggests that there is a only a 50% chance of choose one of two options but a 75% chance of choosing one of 4 options)</p><p>Although overvaluing your services can be bad for business, undervaluing them can be equally damaging. Clients are often more willing to stick with a business that provides great service, is passionate , possesses superior knowledge and continues to provide value on an ongoing basis rather than one that only offers a lower price.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Dependency Inject (DI) is one of the most notable practices to create reliable and high-quality software. This effort enables us to keep the extensibility without losing readability and testability. You may have encountered a situation where you would want to replace any objects in the software flexibly like me. Many frameworks or libraries are allowing us to make use of the dependency injection in our software project. In my case, I would like to use <a href="https://dagger.dev/">Dagger</a> in our web application using <a href="https://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a>. But I was ignorant of what Dagger was and how to use it in our Dropwizard project. Hence, this article is for writing down the process to get started with Dagger in your web application using Dropwizard.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dagger">What is Dagger</h2>

<p>First of all, what is Dagger? Dagger is a Java-based dependency injection library originally invented by <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>. For now, it’s mainly maintained by Google as an open-source project.</p>

<p>You might hear about <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a> before, which is also maintained by Google. It has a more extended history than Dagger. Despite that, Dagger has a more significant number of stars in <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger">its GitHub repository</a>. Why is Dagger more popular than Guice? There are several reasons from my perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dagger is compiling time DI library, while Guice’s injection happens at runtime</li>
  <li>Guice often causes challenging error to solve relating to its reflection usage</li>
  <li>Dagger provides more simple APIs to use</li>
  <li>Dagger has notable use cases due to the adoption in the Android development</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, I try to use Dagger in our web application this time.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-integrate-dagger-in-dropwizard-project">How to integrate Dagger in Dropwizard project</h2>

<p>What I’m going to do is integrate Dagger in a Dropwizard project to inject Jersey resources flexibly. Before going deeper into this goal, we need to be familiar with some Dagger terminologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Module</code>: Has associations between the interface and actual injected objects.</li>
  <li><code>Component</code>: Constructs a whole graph resolving the dependencies of injected objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike Guice, what I’ve found is that we needed to construct one more class called <code>Component</code>. The component is a sort of highest level class managing all objects injected by Dagger. Therefore, all objects should be injected from the component.</p>

<p>In our case, we will create <code>WebResourceModule</code> for the module and <code>WebappComponent</code> for the component.</p>

<p>The client of the injected class can use the <code>javax.inject.Inject</code> annotation. Constructor injection or field injection is recommended in Dagger.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/users"</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>UserResource</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>@Inject</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>UserResource</span><span>(</span><span>UserConfig</span> <span>userConfig</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Used for the user resource specific configuration</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>config</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are going to inject <code>UserConfig</code> as we like by using Dagger.</p>

<p>The dagger library can be imported with the following code in <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>dependencies</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>implementation</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.28.1'</span>
  <span>annotationProcessor</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.28.1'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="module-and-component">Module and Component</h2>

<p>First, we define the module to illustrate how to construct the target <code>UserConfig</code> class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Module</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dagger.Provides</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Module</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>UserConfig</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>configuration</span><span>.</span><span>getUserConfig</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@Provides</span>
    <span>UserConfig</span> <span>provideUserConfig</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>@Provides</code> annotation lets the compiler know how to construct the class at the compile time. Therefore, all classes in the application use the <code>UserConfig</code> constructed by the method, <code>provideUserConfig</code>. Next, we can create a module class for building the whole dependency graph.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Component</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Component</span><span>(</span><span>modules</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>WebResourceModule</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>})</span>
<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>UserResource</span> <span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The argument of <code>@Component</code> annotation specifies the modules knowing how to construct the injected objects. All <code>WebappComponent</code> interface needs to provide is the method to build the object we finally want to get. In this case, the web resource which will be registered into the Dropwizard later. That’s all that we must do with Dagger.</p>

<p>But here comes one question. Who creates the instance of <code>WebappComponent</code>? The answer is Dagger. Dagger generates a class prefixed by <code>Dagger</code>. In this case, <code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> will be created to construct the <code>UserResource</code> from it. Additionally, it provides us a way to bind a module at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="dropwizard-application">Dropwizard Application</h2>

<p>In the Dropwizard, we will get the component class to get the <code>UserResource</code> and register it as a jersey resource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Application</span> <span>extends</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>dropwizard</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Configuration</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Application</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>@Override</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>@NotNull</span> <span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>,</span> <span>Environment</span> <span>environment</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Bind the module to inject the user configuration</span>
    <span>// All objects dependent on the UserConfig can change the behavior without rewriting them.</span>
    <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>component</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                                <span>new</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

    <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>jersey</span><span>().</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>component</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> has a builder interface to bind the module at runtime. By changing the module here, we can change the behavior. For the test purpose, we can write a component like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WebappComponent</span> <span>testComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                            <span>new</span> <span>TestWebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

<span>UserResource</span> <span>testUserResource</span> <span>=</span> <span>testComponent</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It obviously helps us write more testable code.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>

<p>As we saw now, using a Dagger looks easy. Dagger enabled me to write more maintainable code without learning many things. Its simple APIs significantly reduce the trouble and burden to employ the DI framework in our software projects. Let’s try to use Dagger in your Dropwizard project as well!</p>

He says, “All BS. I wasn’t meant for educators, as those are actually their issues with me (i.e. teaching disabilities).”</p><p>He’s an inspiration as I’ve faced similar obstacles especially with the focus of compliance in the educational system over creativity, curiosity, even intellect has <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">hurt me in my educational career</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2><p>I started writing these <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">essays</a> and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU87CN_FxGC1q3hzWM0CCDA" target="_blank">videos</a> because <strong>ideas are the currency of the 21st century. </strong>I humbly believe the ideas I share could help others as I pursue my <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.substack.com/" target="_blank">Curiosities</a><em>.</em></p><p>Eric Weinstein’s ideas have awakened me and showed a world unknown to most people, such as the real world of academia and science.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these ideas is what he calls the <strong>DISC</strong> (Distributed Idea Suppression Complex) which explains how disruptive and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo are suppressed. Keeping institutions safe from individuals who create change.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is spread throughout major institutions such as in academia, the mainstream media, and politics. It tries to undermine ideas that may challenge or weaken the elite. This isn’t directly planned, and it’s not under central control.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric and his family have been victims of the DISC multiple times. Eric in physics, his wife in economics, and his brother in biology. He started noticing the same pattern in politics when MSNBC hid polling graphics of presidential candidate Andrew Yang.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is only one of these marvelous ideas that Eric explores in his podcast called The Portal where he explores subjects including science, economics, culture, politics, and business.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the show is to help you see the world through a different lens, which opens up your mind to new ways of viewing events and your life. Each guest is a portal to a reality showcasing what we would normally consider impossible, are indeed possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s visit The Portal!</p><h2>Favorite Episodes</h2><p>Eric launched The Portal in June 2019 and less than a year later has created a community of people who want to explore this hidden reality and discover new portals.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric has wide expertise in many fields, but what’s interesting is how he engages your mind, moves your heart, and lights a spark in your soul. Eric can discover unexplored worlds and bring them back to his audience. Sometimes, complex or hard to understand, but always interesting where you get the sense of upgrading your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my favorite episodes:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s" target="_blank"><strong>1: Peter Thiel:</strong></a><strong> </strong>this was how I found the podcast. Peter rarely appears on interviews, so I knew this one had to be special. Peter Thiel is one of the most influential and contrarian thinkers of the last decades. He’s also the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir. He was also the first big investor in Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and Eric challenge our way of thinking and encourage us to see things differently. For instance, they discussed the relationship between growth and violence. Thiel argues that if economic growth is low, violence is more likely to arise. He highlights that violence among humans is high because according to Rene Girard, we want what other people want, giving rise to conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>This may be one of the best episodes in the history of podcasts. I found this conversion can help you understand Girard’s theories' implications in society, especially in a time of wealth gap inequality, racial conflicts, and a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>They also discussed the era of stagnation, the future of education, student debt, the broken world of academia, and polymaths.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter (a conservative) and Eric (a progressive) discuss ideas with unique and often opposing views as they try to find a solution and reach an agreement on his arguments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000462975502" target="_blank"><strong>19: Bret Weinstein - The Prediction and the DISC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In this rigid conversation with Bret, they talked about the DISC and how it affected Bret with one of his biology discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Eric eagerly tries to get his brother to tell the story of his powerful finding. Bret discovered that the mice we use for medical trials have ultra-long telomeres (something humans don’t have) and that these “hide” the dangers of certain medicines. This same discovery could cure cancer and end aging.&nbsp;</p><p>After he discovered this, he tried to go the usual path of peer-review and so on. According to the podcast, he was silenced. Yet his findings were taken and made someone else the Nobel Prize winner.&nbsp;</p><p>A mind-blowing episode that will stir your curiosity and make you learn about the findings, the DISC, and The Portal.</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000460365533" target="_blank"><strong>17: Anna Khachiyan - Reconstructing The Mystical Feminine From The Ashes Of “The Feminine Mystique”:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Eric interviews Anna, who is a Russian-American social, literary and artistic theorist. She is also the co-host of the fierce and popular Red Scare podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the conversation, Eric tells her, “I've been addicted to your podcast not quite understanding why. It's one of the strangest things I've ever found.” That’s exactly how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>They talked about mystery and how society thought we wanted clarity and directness. But what we actually want is mystery, especially in our relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they talked about the importance of mystery and what it means to be mysterious. This episode will help you perceive the significance of how we can use mystery in our lives.</p><p>I’ll be honest, I don’t know why I liked this episode, but I listened to it several times and it was weirdly fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS </strong><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000477637846" target="_blank"><strong>36: Dark Matter, Black Matters and All That Jazz</strong></a><strong> </strong>with Stephon Alexander is an amazing episode to learn more about physics, racial issues, and music.&nbsp;</p><h2>Geometrically Unified</h2><p>I disagree with many of Eric’s views, however I still consider him a role model because of his love and passion for science. He proposed a theory of everything called Geometric Unity where he tried to explain and combine all physical aspects of the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>I love learning about science. I read books, email experts, watch interviews, write essays, and listen to podcasts like The Portal to learn more about science.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Science</strong> combined with <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> has the power to create a world of progress and technological advancement, so we create a world of equality, fairness, and peace.&nbsp; That’s what I hope to do with my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you find Eric’s work as interesting, fascinating, and curious as I have.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://jenvermet.com/" target="_blank">Jen</a>, <a href="https://salman.io/" target="_blank">Salman</a>, <a href="https://juliasaxena.com/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://fullofkrapp.com/" target="_blank">Kevin</a>  for reading drafts of this essay. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595770382135_5451"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), join us at our<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>newsletter</strong></a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out. <br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <hr> 
<p>I manage this website with markdown and a shell scripts. Hereâ€™s how.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast load time</li>
<li>Minimal Interface</li>
<li>A site directory</li>
<li>Readable URLs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>A fancy framework</li>
<li>Site analytics/admin interface</li>
<li>Large files</li>
<li>Ads</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent some time in HTML/CSS designing a header for the site. This includes a generic title for each page, an â€œAboutâ€� tab, â€œPostsâ€� tab, â€œContactâ€� tab, and horizontal bar to separate the header from the body. I linked each tab to the URL I planned for each page, which is my domain (jarbus.net) followed by the filename with the <code>.html</code> extension removed. (e.g.Â&nbsp;jarbus.net/About)</p>
<p>I write all my posts in markdown, then convert it to HTML using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a conversion script to turn an HTML file for a post into an HTML file for the site. I accomplish this by creating a new file consisting of the header HTML mentioned, concatenating with the post HTML afterwards. I also run a <code>sed</code> command to replace the generic title in the header for the filename of the post, with dashes replaced with spaces.</p>
<p>I keep my markdown files in a directory called â€œdraftsâ€�, which is sibling to the GitHub Pages repository thatâ€™s hosting my website. When Iâ€™m done with a post, I convert it to a site page, move it to the git repository, then push. Itâ€™s that easy!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/About">About</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/jarbus.net">Index</a>, and <a href="http://jarbus.net/Contact">Contact</a> pages all maintained as above. I used to have a script to automatically recreate my <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a> page to add new entries, but found that I much prefer the curated &amp; categorical page I have now.</p>

<p>I also have an <a href="http://jarbus.net/feed">rss feed</a>, which I update manually. However, given that adding a new entry simply requires putting</p>
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;
    PostName
  &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    https://www.jarbus.net/PostName
  &lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
<p>at the top of my feed file, I think Iâ€™ll manage. Plus, I enjoy the ability add custom tags on a post by post basis if I decide to.</p>

<p>Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with how the site turned outâ€“I have absolute control over all aspects of my blog while doing negligible content management. I have lighting-fast load times, a minimal interface, and can fix any aspect of my site were something to break.</p>

    <div>
        <p>As much as I like the Amazon Firestick and Apple TV, both are missing a killer smart TV feature: the ability to easily make memes from viewed content.</p>

<p>Currently, if you want to make a meme from video content, you need to either screenshot the appropriate frames or capture a section of the video. This can be done somewhat easily on mobile and increasingly so on desktop, but it’s still a chore.</p>

<p>But if you are sitting on the couch and you see something funny on your Smart TV, the process of creating a meme is much higher friction. How likely is it that you will pull out another device, find the same content all-over again, capture it, then edit into a meme? I’m exhausted just at the thought.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-solution-meme-it">Proposed Solution: “Meme It!”</h2>

<p>Instead, what if the next time you are watching TV and you see a funny and loop-able moment like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Loop.png" alt="Lucille Bluth's exaggerated wink on Arrested Development"></p>

<p>Or you see a funny clip of a show like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Panels.png" alt="Scene from Parks and Rec"></p>

<p>You, as the user, can just speak into your smart TV remote and say “Meme It!”</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Capture.png" alt="User says &quot;Meme It!&quot; into smart TV remote"></p>

<p>Later at your convenience, you can edit the desired video into a meme using the smart TV app on your phone. By default, the previous 10 seconds of audio, video, and closed captioning text. But if you want to capture more time just say “Meme It last X seconds.”</p>

<p>And unlike creating memes on mobile or desktop, the “Meme It” server knows that the user is capturing media for the purpose of meme creation as opposed to capturing video or business purposes. As a result, the server can then process the video and create markers with thumbnails for each cut from one camera view to another or moments when the total count of people / entities in-frame changes.</p>

<h2 id="usages-and-applications">Usages and Applications</h2>

<p>Publishing the resulting memes to social networks is table-stakes but a few more interesting applications include:</p>



<p>As OTT networks continue to compete for increasingly limited disposal personal income, any strategy that increases stickiness at a lower cost than exclusive content can and should be tried in my opinion. And while I do not think an OTT social network will ever replace the dominant social networks, users could still find value in them if they are integrated into the media consumption. What that would look like would vary by platform: any Disney social features will need to be closely moderated for family friendliness while Adult Swim’s would be a much wilder and woolier place.</p>

<h3 id="meme-based-content-discovery">Meme-Based Content Discovery</h3>

<p>Further, I wouldn’t mind browsing TV content via Memes. It is frustrating to wait and see if one likes a new TV show - maybe it gets funnier in the next episode, or maybe it doesn’t - but seeing a few of the shows greatest moments in meme format could help.</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Show%20Page.png" alt="Parks and Rec show page with memes"></p>

<h3 id="personal-meme-wallet">Personal Meme Wallet</h3>

<p>Most memes are currently created for distribution in the relatively “big rooms” of social networks. As high friction as it is to create video memes right now, that makes sense in terms of the effort:reward ratio.</p>

<p>But as “Meme It!” drastically reduce the required work, people will create more memes, and I expect, increasingly for smaller audiences, such as families or partners. That 3 second video loop may not be funny to everyone but it might slay in your small group, especially if it was initially viewed together. To facilitate this, any memes created via “Meme It” in a “Meme Wallet” that can be accessed via iMessenger / Hangouts / Whats App / any messaging application.</p>

<h2 id="potential-blocks-and-objections">Potential Blocks and Objections</h2>

<p>Content Publishers may not like the idea of more people repurposing their content but I think this is counter-productive. Just like it is largely true that there’s no such thing as bad publicity, having content memed is free advertisement for the original piece of content.</p>

<p>I would go as far as to say that shows that are not memed will have much shorter lifespans than those that are. No-one who is currently 12 years old will be unaware that the TV show “The Office” exists due to the plethora of memes from the show. But “Seinfeld” is far less memed and I suspect it will fade quicker as a result.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The “Meme It!” Smart TV voice command would let smart TV users easily create memes from recently watched content. Reducing the friction of creating memes would lead to more fun memes and frankly we could all use a little more of that right now. And meme-ing video content is effectively free advertising so hopefully copyright rights holders will give this their blessing.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This essay is an illustrated proof of the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem; the NFL theorem has many variants, which all say slightly different things. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">most famous one</a> says, roughly, that every learning algorithm has the same performance, when averaged across all possible target functions. In other words, there is no universal learning algorithm that outperforms every other algorithm on every learning task.</p>

<p>Throughout this essay, I'm going to be refering to a "learning algorithm". If you're unfamiliar, in the machine learning context, a learning algorithm is an algorithm that takes in \(S\), a series of (x,y) pairs, i.e. our training data or training set, from some target function and outputs a hypothesis, which is a function that tries to be close to the original target function. Note that the inputs and outputs aren't necessarily  binary, but it's easier to illustrate them as such, and the proof is not affected. Learning algorithms are often evaluated by looking at the error rate, which in the case of classification, is the proportion of \((x,y)\) pairs it predicts incorrectly.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/hypothesis.svg"></p>

<p>In this essay, I will focus on an easier NFL theorem (from <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/%7Eshais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html">Understanding Machine Learning by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David</a>) which says, roughly, for any learning algorithm that outputs a binary function, there exists a distribution that will cause it to output a hypothesis with a high error rate, even when there exists another function that can achieve 0 error on the distribution. In other words, for every learning algorithm, we can find a distribution that can trip up the learning algorithm.</p>

<p>How do we formalize this? </p>

<p>The NFL theorem we're going to prove states that:</p>

<p>Say we have a learning algorithm A which outputs a binary classifier (this is our hypothesis) over a domain \(X\). </p>

<p>Next, let's define an error or loss function, which will tell us how well our output hypothesis does on the actual distribution. We'll use the <strong>1</strong> loss function \(L\) which, when given two inputs, outputs 0 if the two values match, otherwise it outputs 1. Then, there exists a distribution \(D\) over \(X \times \{0,1\}\) (i.e. a distribution over possible \((x,\{0,1\})\) values) such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There exists a function \(f: X \to \{0,1\}\) with \(L_D(f) = 0\). That is, there is some binary function over \(X\) such that the expected loss of \(f\) over \(D\) is 0. In other words, there is some function which will correctly classify all the points in our distribution correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>With probability of at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) over the choice of \(S \sim D^m\) \(L_D(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}\). In other words, for at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) of all possible training sets of size \(m\) from \(D\), the expected loss of output of the training algorithm on the training set is at least  \(\frac{1}{8}\). (Note that our loss function is defined here as the average <strong>1</strong> loss across all points in the distribution).</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution \(D\) is defined over \(2m\) points, so our training set will consist of at most \(m\) unique values, i.e. half of the distribution's points. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/nfl-base.svg"></p>

<p>To prove this, we are actually going to prove something different, but equivalent. Instead, we are going to prove that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))] \ge 1/4\)</p>

<p>That is, if we run our learning algorithm on training sets of size \(m\), across a family of distributions \(D_1-D_T\), the largest such expected loss will be at least \(\frac{1}{4}\). In other words, we will show that at least one distribution \(D_i\) from this group will trip up our algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/dist-one-fourth-error.svg"></p>

<p>To see how these two statements are equivalent, we just apply a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality">Markvov's inequality</a>. This lower bounds how likely a random variable is to be greater than some value:</p>

<p>\(P(X \ge a) \ge \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]-a}{1-a}\)</p>

<p>Applying that to our inequality above, we see that:</p>

<p>\(P(L_{D_i}(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}) \ge \frac{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}} \ge \frac{1}{7}\) as desired. So now we just need prove this new inequality.</p>

<p>Before that, here's the intuition for why this inequality is true:</p>

<p>First, our learning algorithm only gets half of all possible points as its training set. This means our algorithm knows nothing about the labels of the other half of the points. Now, if we assume that every function over these unknown points is equally likely, then each point is either 1 or a 0. This means that our algorithm can only guess for these unknown points, which makes its expected error rate 0.5. So in the best case, it'll still get an error rate of 0 on the half it sees and 0.5 on the half it doesn't see, which makes its overall error 0.25.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/seen-unseen-data.svg"></p>

<h3>The Proof</h3>

<p>Now, let's begin the proof.</p>

<p>Let \(C \subseteq X\) such that \(|C| = 2m\). So it's a subset of our input space that's of size \(2m\). </p>

<p>Notice that there are \(T = 2^{2m}\) possible functions from \(C\) to \(\{0,1\}\).  Let \(D_i\) be the distribution over \(D\) that only assigns probability to the \((x,f_i(x))\) pairs for the corresponding function. This captures the idea that our input space \(C\) is twice the size of our training set, and that each function is equally likely. </p>

<p>Each function is now turned into a probability distribution that places \(\frac{1}{|C|}\) probability if the given \((x,y)\) point is one of the function's input/output pairs, and 0 probability otherwise. So each unique function has a unique distribution associated with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/function-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Recall that we're trying to calculate \(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\), i.e. the expected loss over all possible training examples, with regards to the distribution that maximizes this loss. </p>

<p>For any given distribution,  \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\) is the loss for a given training set, averaged over all possible choices of training data. </p>

<p>If our input space consists of \(2m\) points and our training data consists of a sequence of \(m\) points, then there are \(k = (2m)^m\) possible sequences. </p>

<p>Below, we'll let \(S_j^i\) be the \(i^{th}\) possible sequence of training data, labeled with the \(j^{th}\) possible function. </p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sij.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus, we know that \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}}[L_{D_i}(A(S))] = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\). In other words, for any one given distribution of data, the expected loss of our learning algorithm (across all training data sets) is equal to the expected loss if we take \(m\) training points, averaged across all possible functions that could label the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-distr-error.svg"> </p>

<p>Recall that, from above, we care about taking the <strong>maximum</strong> error across all possible distributions; by definition, this will be at least as big as the <strong>average</strong> loss across all distributions. Thus, we know that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-distr-training.svg"> </p>

<p>Next, it doesn't really matter if we take the average over all distributions first or the average over all training sets first. Thus, we can switch the order of the summations to get the same value:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) =\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-training-distr.svg"></p>

<p>Now, if we're taking the loss averaged over all training data, notice that this will necessarily have to be at least as big as the loss given by the training data which leads to the <strong>smallest</strong> average loss. </p>

<p>Thus, we can replace our inequality with a smaller, simpler one. Our inequality has to be at least as large as the average loss (across all functions) when applied to that specific training set.</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \underset{j \in [k]}{\text{min }} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-training-error.svg"> </p>

<p>So we've been abstractly talking about the loss function for a while now. What does \(L_{D_i}(h)\) actually represent? We want it to be how well our hypothesis does on a specific distribution \(D_i\). One straightforward way to formalize this is to just go through all \((x,y)\) pairs in \(D_i\) and take the average <strong>1</strong> loss between \(y\) and \(h(x)\):</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss.svg"></p>

<p>Next, let's fix some \(j \in [k]\), which has \(m\) training examples given by \(S_j = (x_1,..,x_m)\). Let \((v_1, ...,v_p)\) be the examples in \(C\) (all data points) that <strong>aren't</strong> in \(S_j\). We can see that \(p \ge m\) because at most we have half the data from the distribution, which is when we have no duplicates.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/p-data.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) =\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)] \ge \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss-p.svg"> </p>

<p>In other words, the average loss over all points in the distribution is at least half of the average loss over all points <strong>not</strong> in the training set. </p>

<p>Now, we can substitutue this in for \(L_{D_i}\) from our inequality earlier to get:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p>So now we're taking the loss across all functions, across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\). Like before, we can swap the order of the summations:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] =\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-p-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Once again, we can upper bound this inequality by noticing that the average loss across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\) and across all functions has to be at least the loss of the point \(v_r\) which we assume to be the point which gives the minimal loss:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] \ge \frac{1}{2}\underset{r \in [p]}{\text{min}}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_r) \not= f_i(v_r)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-p-error.svg"></p>

<p>Now, notice that we can partition \([T]\) into \((f_a, f_b)\) pairs such that \(f_a\) and \(f_b\) agree on every value except …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-450095a061b684fe116b"><div><p>Beginning in 2013, I began a series of essays that outlined my vision for an OTT “<a href="https://redef.com/original/disney-as-a-service-why-disney-is-closer-than-ever-to-walts-60-year-old-vision">Disney as a Service</a>” subscription, including how it would work, its likely <a href="https://redef.com/original/disney-as-a-service-pt-ii-and-the-future-of-the-house-of-mouse">pricing</a> ($6) and release date (2019), and why it was <a href="https://redef.com/original/nine-reasons-why-disney-will-succeed-and-why-four-criticisms-are-overhyped">likely to rapidly attract tens of millions of customers</a>. These pieces were based on my reading of (and obsession with) Disney’s corporate strategy and culture, the strength of its IP, the decisions it’d begun to make behind the scenes, as well as the developing changes in media technology and business models. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/10/18658964/amazon-prime-video-netflix-disney-plus-streaming-video-lotr-matthew-ball-peter-kafka-media-podcast">Vox/Recode</a> has reported on how the “DAAS” series has influenced Bob Iger and Kevin Mayer.</p><p>To this end, I’m often asked about Nintendo (one of few companies I adore more). Many believe that Nintendo is Disney circa 2014 or 2015 or 2016 or 2017 — and thus poised for substantial growth as it makes the transition to online or D2C or OTT distribution or mobile or [new thing]. And certainly, there are many similarities. There is no other gaming company with more beloved and long-running IP, a stronger culture of creativity in storytelling, a deeper history of immersive/technological innovation, more resonant content brand, and so on. </p><p>In fact, it’s easy to map the Disney ethos to Nintendo’s more recent public positioning. In early 2019, Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime gave a speech in Seattle where he said that Nintendo aspires to be an "entertainment" company, not a gaming one: “That time you spend surfing the Web, watching a movie, watching a telecast of a conference: that's all entertainment time we’re competing for. [Nintendo]’s competitive set is much bigger than [its] direct competitors in Sony and Microsoft. [Nintendo] competes for time.”</p><p>Furthermore, Fils-Aime declared that the Nintendo now had three "pieces of business": (1) a dedicated proprietary hardware video game business ("the way most of our consumers interact with us"); (2) a mobile gaming business; (3) the expansion of Nintendo’s IP outside of core gaming applications (“[Nintendo is] about Mario, Zelda, Pokémon — all these wonderful intellectual properties… How we leverage these across a variety of entertainment platforms is how we're looking to grow the company… a belief that [consumers will] come back, maybe buy a Mario T-shirt, eat that Mario cereal, or buy a Switch, because of affiliation and affection they have with that IP.”)</p><p>This framing feels a lot like Disney saying films are the core of its entertainment flywheel, that OTT streaming video is the company’s new growth and investment area, and that it will continue to proliferate its IP into emergent categories. And, as with Disney in the early- to mid-2010s, there’s evidence of this transition. The company is underway with its first-ever theme park lands, its first feature film in nearly three decades, and several new interactive merchandise partnerships with the likes of Lego and more.</p><p>More broadly, one could argue Fils-Aime’s positioning and Nintendo’s commercial expansions suggest a company ready to conquer all entertainment platforms as part of the ever-growing “IP” wars. The focus on minutes, for example, sounds more like a mega-cap tech company like Microsoft, Netflix, or Amazon than it does a modest Japanese game maker. And while Nintendo might be late to individual battles, one key lesson of the past twenty years is that top IP is more valuable and extensible than ever believed before. And thus, for the very same reason Nintendo’s IP feels under-tapped today, it can be tardy and still rise to the top — like Disney in streaming. And given the enormous growth potential in the category (which some consider to be in the trillions), Nintendo could grow several fold (prior to COVID, Disney was up 45% since announcing Disney+).</p><p>However, the “Nintendo is Disney” thesis is deeply flawed. It feels more like a desire to apply a pattern than to find a real analogue. Elements of Nintendo certainly represent Disney, but they represent Disney insofar as both companies are best in class creators of four-quadrant, multi-generational content. Otherwise the businesses are fundamentally different, their management styles fundamentally different, and their approaches to content itself are fundamentally different, too.</p><p>The best way to unpack this is to walk through Nintendo’s culture in (1) Hardware; (2) Content, as is shown through the company’s efforts in mobile; and (3) Ambition. After that, I’ll discuss the company’s future (sections four and five).</p><p><span><strong>#1: Nintendo’s Hardware Culture</strong></span></p><p>There are essentially four types of companies in gaming:  </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Platforms like Microsoft, Sony and Valve, which produce hardware and/or operate digital stores that allow players to play games. In exchange, the platforms take a percentage of each game sold for their platforms (and associated in-game sales), plus charge various license fees to publishers, and often sell additional services to their user base</p></li><li><p>Publishers like EA and Activision Blizzard, which finance the creation of games and manage their marketing and distribution, in exchange for (or by loaning out) IP, equity in the title, and the associated majority of profits </p></li><li><p>Developers like Naughty Dog and Visual Concepts, which literally design and “make” a game</p></li><li><p>Infrastructure and middleware providers like Epic Games, Unity, Amazon and Microsoft, which operate extensive technology suites that enable developers to more easily create, distribute, and operate their games. In this case, they take a licensing fee, typically as a percentage of revenue or based on total traffic/data/etc.</p></li></ol><p>Each of the major platforms also owns (or has exclusivity agreements) with top publishers, which in themselves own (and/or have exclusive agreements with) top developers. This allows the platforms to differentiate their hardware through exclusive content. This is particularly helpful when releasing a new generation of consoles. At launch, a console’s player base is too small for major developers to prioritize versus building games for the outgoing generation (which, by definition, will have a larger customer base than ever before). However, a platform’s goals are much broader than maximizing the sales of a specific title — it hopes to build an ecosystem where it nets revenue from the sale of all titles. Other variations of this model exist. Valve, for example, sometimes develops games (which it then publishes) to drive not just its platforms (Steam) but also its game engine, Source, or the industry overall (e.g. virtual reality).</p><p>Nintendo is unique as a “hardware platform” because it really isn’t one anymore. <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1210345159549968384?s=20">To quote Tim Sweeney</a>, founder and CEO of Epic Games, “something is a platform when the majority of content people spend time with is created by others.” Although Nintendo operates a hardware platform like Microsoft’s Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation, 85% of software sold for Nintendo hardware is now made by Nintendo. This is the reverse of industry averages (e.g. 85%+ of PlayStation playtime comes from games not published by Sony). This makes Nintendo a sort of fifth type of company. They make hardware so that its development arm can make the games it wants to make, which also happens to be hardware that other developers can distribute their games through but mostly don’t. (It is true that the NES and SNES era saw vast third-party libraries, but Nintendo being the standard-bearer of third-party gaming content has not been valid since 1995, when the PlayStation launched).</p><p>And over the past forty years, it’s indisputable that Nintendo’s development arms have been the best in the business. Per GameRankings/Metacritic, five of the top ten and nine of the top twenty best reviewed games of all time come from the Kyoto-based company.</p><p>Because Nintendo thrives at content but doesn’t generate platform-like profits, investors have long argued Nintendo should get out of the hardware business and focus exclusively on games. This would produce value in several ways. First, hardware sales typically generate little to no profit as it’s sold below and/or at manufacturing cost. This loss leader strategy isn’t a problem if you can make it up in third-party licensing fees (i.e. from the sale of games made by others), but per above, this business is marginal for Nintendo. In addition, the cost of developing, marketing, and holding inventory is high.</p><p>This approach also limits the sales potential for Nintendo’s games to those who own their hardware. There are over a hundred million PlayStation and Xbox consumers who might happily buy <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> or <em>Super Mario</em> for $60 to play on their PlayStation or Xbox but won’t spend $300 on a Switch just to do so. (And then there are the hundreds of millions of iPads, iPhones and Androids, which I’ll get into later.)</p><p>For twenty years, Nintendo has refused this strategy. And to the company’s credit, its dedication to hardware has led to significant innovation in the marketplace. Nintendo created the D-Pad, analog stick, and rumble packs, and was first to distribute VR, motion-based, and fully portable consoles. These hardware innovations resulted in content innovations, too (e.g. Wii Sport, Wii Fit, Brain Age, etc.). It’s also clear that when Nintendo achieves a consumer tech breakthrough, it sees substantial in-generation console success (e.g. Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Switch).</p><p>At the same time, the “breakthrough” Nintendo consoles tend to see substantially less success than most assume. And they don’t ever really “break away” from their competitors, either. The Wii “won” the seventh generation with unit shipments of roughly 105MM. But PlayStation 3 did 90MM and Xbox 360 hit 85MM. This isn’t a huge gap, especially given the latter two charged (and thus generated) roughly $100–150 more per unit. More revealing is the fact that the Wii’s early lead in the seventh generation was substantially larger than its finishing win. The PlayStation 3 and Wii both launched in November 2006, but after a year, Nintendo had nearly 200% greater sales (17MM v 6.5MM). The Wii launched a …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In modern computer programming, concurrency is often required to accelerate solving a problem. In Python programming, we usually have the three library options to achieve concurrency, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html"><code>multiprocessing</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html"><code>threading</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"><code>asyncio</code></a>. Recently, I was aware that as a scripting language Python’s behavior of concurrency has subtle differences compared to the conventional compiled languages such as C/C++.</p>



<p><a href="https://realpython.com/">Real Python</a> has already given a good <a href="https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/">tutorial</a> with <a href="https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/concurrency-overview">code examples</a> on Python concurrency. In this blog post, I would like to discuss the <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code> in Python from a high-level, with some additional caveats that the Real Python tutorial has not mentioned. I have also borrowed some good diagrams from their tutorial and the readers should give the credits to them on those illustrations.</p>

<h3 id="cpu-bound-vs-io-bound">CPU-Bound VS I/O-Bound</h3>

<p>The problems that our modern computers are trying to solve could be generally categorized as CPU-bound or I/O-bound. Whether the problem is CPU-bound or I/O-bound affects our selection from the concurrency libraries <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code>. Of course, in some scenarios, the algorithm design for solving the problem might change the problem from CPU-bound to I/O-bound or vice versa. The concept of CPU-bound and I/O-bound are universal for all programming languages.</p>

<h4 id="cpu-bound">CPU-Bound</h4>

<p>CPU-bound refers to a condition when the time for it to complete the task is determined principally by the speed of the central processor. The faster clock-rate CPU we have, the higher performance of our program will have.</p>

    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Synchronous for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most of single computer programs are CPU-bound. For example, given a list of numbers, computing the sum of all the numbers in the list.</p>

<h4 id="io-bound">I/O-Bound</h4>

<p>I/O bound refers to a condition when the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound. Increasing CPU clock-rate will not increase the performance of our program significantly. On the contrary, if we have faster I/O, such as faster memory I/O, hard drive I/O, network I/O, etc, the performance of our program will boost.</p>

</div>

<p>Most of the web service related programs are I/O-bound. For example, given a list of restaurant names, finding out their ratings on Yelp.</p>

<h3 id="process-vs-thread-in-python">Process VS Thread in Python</h3>

<h4 id="process-in-python">Process in Python</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">global interpreter lock</a> (GIL) is a mechanism used in computer-language interpreters to synchronize the execution of threads so that only one native thread can execute at a time. An interpreter that uses GIL always allows exactly one native thread to execute at a time, even if run on a multi-core processor. Note that the native thread here is the number of threads in the physical CPU core, instead of the thread concept in the programming languages.</p>



<p>Because Python interpreter uses GIL, a single-process Python program could only use one native thread during execution. That means single-process Python program could not utilize CPU more than 100% (we define the full utilization of a native thread to be 100%) regardless whether it is single-process single-thread or single-process multi-thread. Conventional compiled programming languages, such as C/C++, do not have interpreter, not even mention GIL. Therefore, for a single-process multi-thread C/C++ program, it could utilize many CPU cores and many native threads, and the CPU utilization could be greater than 100%.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, we would have to write multi-process Python program to maximize its performance.</p>

<h4 id="thread-in-python">Thread in Python</h4>

<p>Because a single-process Python could only use one CPU native thread. No matter how many threads were used in a single-process Python program, a single-process multi-thread Python program could only achieve at most 100% CPU utilization.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, single-process multi-thread Python program would not improve the performance. However, this does not mean multi-thread is useless in Python. For a I/O-bound task in Python, multi-thread could be used to improve the program performance.</p>

<h3 id="multiprocessing-vs-threading-vs-asyncio-in-python">Multiprocessing VS Threading VS AsyncIO in Python</h3>

<h4 id="multiprocessing">Multiprocessing</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>multiprocessing</code>, we are able to run a Python using multiple processes. In principle, a multi-process Python program could fully utilize all the CPU cores and native threads available, by creating multiple Python interpreters on many native threads. Because all the processes are independent to each other, and they don’t share memory. To do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>multiprocessing</code>, it requires to use the API provided the operating system. Therefore, there will be slightly large overhead.</p>

    <figcaption>Multi-Process for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, <code>multiprocessing</code> would be a perfect library to use to maximize the performance.</p>

<h4 id="threading">Threading</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>threading</code>, we are able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. By overlapping the waiting time for requests, we are able to improve the performance. In addition, because all the threads share the same memory, to do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>threading</code>, we would have to be careful and use locks when necessary. Lock and unlock make sure that only one thread could write to memory at one time, but this will also introduce some overhead. Note that the threads we discussed here are different to the native threads in CPU core. The number of native threads in CPU core is usually 2 nowadays, but the number of threads in a single-process Python program could be much larger than 2.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-11-Python-Concurrency-High-Level/Threading.webp">
    <figcaption>Single-Process Multi-Thread for I/O-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Therefore, for a I/O-bound task in Python, <code>threading</code> could be a good library candidate to use to maximize the performance.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that all the threads are in a pool and there is an executer from the operating system managing the threads deciding who to run and when to run. This can be a short-coming of <code>threading</code> because the operating system actually knows about each thread and can interrupt it at any time to start running a different thread. This is called pre-emptive multitasking since the operating system can pre-empt your thread to make the switch.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio">AsyncIO</h4>

<p>Given <code>threading</code> is using multi-thread to maximize the performance of a I/O-bound task in Python, we wonder if using multi-thread is necessary. The answer is no, if you know when to switch the tasks. For example, for each thread in a Python program using <code>threading</code>, it will really stay idle between the request is sent and the result is returned. If somehow a thread could know the time I/O request has been sent, it could switch to do another task, without staying idle, and one thread should be sufficient to manage all these tasks. Without the thread management overhead, the execution should be faster for a I/O-bound task. Obviously, <code>threading</code> could not do it, but we have <code>asyncio</code>.</p>



<p>Using Python <code>asyncio</code>, we are also able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. What’s different to <code>threading</code> is that, <code>asyncio</code> is single-process and single-thread. There is an event loop in <code>asyncio</code> which routinely measure the progress of the tasks. If the event loop has measured any progress, it would schedule another task for execution, therefore, minimizing the time spent on waiting I/O. This is also called cooperative multitasking. The tasks must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out.</p>

    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Asynchronous for I/O-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The short-coming of <code>asyncio</code> is that the even loop would not know what are the progresses if we don’t tell it. This requires some additional effort when we write the programs using <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

<h4 id="htop-vs-top">HTOP vs TOP</h4>

<p><code>htop</code> would sometimes misinterpret multi-thread Python programs as multi-process programs, as it would show multiple <code>PID</code>s for the Python program. <code>top</code> does not have this problem. On StackOverflow, there is also a such <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38544265/multithreaded-python-program-starting-multiple-processes">observation</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Slowsort is a sorting algorithm that is designed to be deterministically sub-optimal. The algorithm was published in 1986 by Andrei Broder and Jorge Stolfi in their paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2805500_Pessimal_Algorithms_and_Simplexity_Analysis">Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis</a> where they expressed a bunch of very in-efficient algorithms. These techniques and algorithms are special because they never make a wrong move while solving a problem, instead, they find ways to delay the success. In this essay, we put our focus on the Slowsort algorithm based on the <em>Multiply and Surrender</em> paradigm.</p>

<p>The <em>Multiply and Surrender (MnS)</em> paradigm, is a humorous take on the popular <em>Divide and Conquer (DnC)</em> technique. MnS splits the problem into subproblems, slightly simpler than the original, and continues doing so recursively for as long as possible. The subproblems are multiplied and the evaluation is delayed till the state that the solving could not be further postponed and then it surrenders.</p>
<p>MnS paradigm is very similar to DnC; but where the DnC actually splits the problems into subproblems to reach the solution quicker, MnS does it to procrastinate, making the entire process very inefficient but yet convergent.</p>
<p>Although Slowsort is a classic example, recursive Fibonacci with no memoization also fares under the MnS paradigm. The recursive code to find <code>n</code>th Fibonacci number is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span><span>(n)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""the function returns the `n`th fibonacci number
    """</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> n &lt; <span>2</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

    
    
    <span>return</span> fib(n - <span>1</span>) + fib(n - <span>2</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>While computing the Fibonacci numbers, we split the problem into subproblems and do this recursively till we are left with elemental states i.e. <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> and which is when we return the initial values which are <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>. This approach is not DnC because we are not splitting the problem into subproblems to achieve optimality, instead are doing a lot of repetitive work and taking a non-polynomial time to generate the Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>Slowsort algorithm draws a lot of similarities to the very popular Mergesort, but while Mergesort operates in <code>O(n . log(n))</code> the complexity of Slowsort is non-polynomial <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> and its best case performs worse than the worst case of bubble sort.</p>
<p>Slowsort algorithm recursively breaks the array sorting problem into two subarray sorting problems and a few extra processing steps. Once the two subarrays are sorted, the algorithm swaps the rightmost elements such that the greatest among the two becomes the rightmost element of the array i.e. the greatest among the two is placed at the correct position relative to each other, and then it invokes the sorting for all elements except this fixed maximum.</p>
<p>The algorithm could this be expressed as following broad steps</p>
<ul>
<li>sort the first half recursively</li>
<li>sort the second half recursively</li>
<li>find the maximum of the whole array by comparing the last elements of both the sorted halves and place it at the end of the array</li>
<li>recursively sort the entire array except for the maximum one</li>
</ul>
<p>The in-place implementation of the Slowsort algorithm is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>_slowsort</span><span>(a, i, j)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the integers in the array
    spanning indexes [i, j].
    """</span>
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> i &gt;= j:
        <span>return</span>

    
    
    
    m = (i + j) // <span>2</span>

    
    _slowsort(a, i, m)
    _slowsort(a, m + <span>1</span>, j)
  
    
    
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> a[m] &gt; a[j]:
        a[m], a[j] = a[j], a[m]
  
    
    
    
    _slowsort(a, i, j - <span>1</span>)


<span><span>def</span> <span>slowsort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the array `a` using Slowsort.
    """</span>
    _slowsort(a, <span>0</span>, len(a) - <span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The Slowsort algorithm typically replaces the <code>merge</code> function of the Mergesort with a simple swap that correctly places the largest element (local maxima) and then invokes the sort function on all but this element. So on every invocation, we keep correctly placing the largest element but in a recursive manner.</p>
<p><em>A visualization of this algorithm could be found in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRoyhGdjnA">youtube video</a>.</em></p>

<p>The runtime of Slowsort could be computed by the following recurrence relation</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473102-cb594e80-cf37-11ea-9015-217c3eda50d6.png" alt="slowsort recurrence relation"></p>
<p>When the above recurrence relation is solved and we find that the asymptotic lower bound for <code>T(n)</code> is given by</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473128-14a99e00-cf38-11ea-905b-f3f473a0d74c.png" alt="lower bound of slowsort"></p>
<p>The above expression suggests that lower bound of Slowsort is non-polynomial in nature and for a sufficiently large <code>n</code> this would be more than <code>n ^ 2</code> implying that even the best case of Slowsort is worse than the worst case of Bubble sort. The illustration below compares the time taken by Slowsort and the recursive implementation of Bubblesort.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88475549-8e4c8680-cf4e-11ea-8ee4-9f7ed345ff5d.png" alt="slowsort vs recursive bubblesort"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iterative implementation of Bubblesort stood no chance in terms of time taken for smaller sets of integers, hence the chart was plotted against the recursive implementation of it. The iterative bubble sort for smaller arrays is nearly flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Bogosort</a> is a sorting algorithm that has an average case time complexity of <code>O(n!)</code> and an unbounded time in the worst case. The algorithm keeps on permuting (shuffling) the array till it is sorted which introduces an unboundedness in its implementation and hence the algorithm is considered to be the worst sorting algorithm ever.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>is_sorted</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> all(a[i] &lt;= a[i + <span>1</span>] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(a) - <span>1</span>))

<span><span>def</span> <span>bogosort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>not</span> is_sorted(a):
        random.shuffle(a)
</code></pre>
<p>The reason that we should rate Slowsort highly is the fact the Bogosort could sort the list in its first shuffle while Slowsort is deterministic and will take <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> time in best case scenario.</p>
<p>A rule that every algorithm follows is that every step that it takes actually makes some progress towards the final goal. Bogosort does not guarantee progress, and since it randomly shuffles the array, at one iteration we could end up at a nearly sorted array while the next shuffle takes us afar.</p>
<p>Slowsort is deterministic and convergent. The number of swaps made (inversions) during the execution is non-increasing which means once two items are swapped they are in the correct order relative to each other. In other words, we say that Slowsort never makes a wrong move.</p>

<p>I wanted a very easy solution for setting up HTTPS so I recently switched my blog from <a href="#">Nginx</a> to <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> <a href="#footnote-content-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>With Caddy I had HTTPS working in <em>minutes</em>, but I had a little trouble setting up a custom 404 page. This is actually very easy to do in Caddy, but it is very hard to figure it out from the documentation. According to the author of Caddy, Matt Holt, <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3336#issuecomment-623239266">better support for custom error pages will be coming in or after Caddy v2.1</a>.</p>
<p>After reading through <a href="https://caddy.community/t/v2-how-to-achieve-custom-404/6874/5">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3336">forum</a> posts, and learning more about the <code>Caddyfile</code> format, here is the solution I came up with. You can <a href="https://vivekseth.com/djfkladsfjasl">see it working here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-caddyfile">My Caddyfile</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>vivekseth</span>.<span>com</span> {
  <span>root</span> <span>*</span> <span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>web</span><span>/</span><span>blog</span><span>/</span><span>public</span>
  <span>file_server</span>
  <span>handle_errors</span> {
    <span>rewrite</span> <span>*</span> <span>/</span><span>404</span><span>/</span><span>index</span>.<span>html</span>
    <span>file_server</span>
  }
}

</code></pre></div><p>This tells Caddy to try to serve files from <code>/home/web/blog/public</code>, and to serve <code>&lt;root&gt;/404/index.html</code> whenever it encounters any error.</p>
<p>If you only want to show your 404 page when there is a 404 error, you can use <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/3336#issuecomment-638947294">this snippet</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-gotcha">One “Gotcha”</h2>
<p>This may seem obvious, but I spent at least 30min trying to debug this issue…</p>
<p>Make sure that the 404 path you use is relative to the “root” you define. For example, since my 404 page is located at <code>/home/web/blog/public/404/index.html</code>, I needed to use <code>/404/index.html</code> as the path. If you use the absolute path to the 404 file, it won’t work.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you set up Caddy with a custom error page!</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="#footnote-link-1">[1]</a> A few days after I set up Caddy, I ended up learning how to set up HTTPS with Nginx using Lets Encrypt. Its actually very easy and only slightly more work than Caddy. If I did not already have Caddy working, I would probably just continue to use Nginx and use Let’s Encrypt’s <code>certbot</code> to generate and auto-renew my SSL certifcates.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>To those of you who give advice on which languages, methodologies, architectures, or whatever else to use, I want to start by saying thank you. Your advice is vital to the growth of millions of people like me who are early in their careers.</p>

<p>But I’ve noticed a pattern with software engineering advice that leads to over-engineering and unnecessary arguments. So I have a request:</p>

<p><em>Please make your advice more specific</em></p>

<p>It’s too often overlooked that there isn’t just one type of “software”, thus it is rare for advice to be applicable to every situation. For example, advice for testing a small B2B web app might not work for embedded device firmware. But it might work for a large B2C web app. And since readers will rarely have experience in all of those situations, I think we should start being more explicit about the applicability of our advice.</p>

<p>Being more specific might help address two big time sinks in the industry:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting">Cargo-culting</a>, like when people read how great Kubernetes works for Netflix, but then they decide to use it for a little Django app (that was me a few years ago).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">Bikeshedding</a>, like when people argue incessantly that a language is useless because it can’t be used in some niche.</li>
</ol>

<p>A good start might be answering questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my scale? (local restaurant website vs. Youtube.com)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of product? (library, web app, CLI tool, firmware, on/off-premise, etc.)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of users? (developers, enterprises, regular people, etc.)</li>
  <li>If not, what should I use instead? (like <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">replacing Hadoop with <code>find/xargs/awk</code></a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it’s hard to find the right balance between hand-holding readers or just saying “buyer beware”. But hopefully spending time to add an extra subheading on “Applicability” to READMEs or blog posts will pay for itself in time spent over-engineering and arguing over minutiae.</p>

<div>
<p>Phenomenology is the study of lived experience from a first-person perspective. As of yet, it has not been applied to incels. Here I will argue that it should be. </p>
<p>An incel is an involuntary celibate, a person who is unable to find a romantic partner despite desiring one. Previously ignored, incels have recently gained a staggering prominence among scholars of violent extremism. For example, this year the Royal Canadian Mounted Police <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/csis-scrs/documents/publications/PubRep-2019-E.pdf">added incels</a> to their Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism classification, effectively labeling them as terrorists.</p>
<p>However, from the point of view of incels, this is all rather baffling; while a handful may fit the mold, violence against the public by an ideology of extremism is as foreign to incels as it is to the reader.</p>
<p>Most academics do present their work by stating that the vast majority of incels are neither violent nor extremist. However, as existing research magnifies the attention given to the extremist variant, the impression is given that all incels are alike, and all are a danger. This is a failure of contextualization, one whose results we have seen before as research developed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks: Islam became securitized, not because it was a security threat, but rather because the majority of attention was focused on a few violent extremists, tainting in the process every other Western non-extremist Muslim.</p>
<p>For incels, the misattribution of their beliefs and desires has caused trouble for many of them: How are they to open up and discuss their plights of loneliness and hopelessness if public perception is that incels are people only interested in violence? The answer is that often they simply can’t.</p>
<p>Perhaps worse still, scorn received from outsiders to the community often leads to a process of chiseling, chipping away at the mental health of incels. Not only must then they carry a burden of solitude, but they also must retreat from the public eye in order to avoid further ostracizement. In practice, such alienation may eventually compound into mental disorders like anxiety and depression, or in extreme cases into self-harm and even suicide.</p>
<p>A proposed solution to this issue is phenomenology. For one, responsible research should seek to avoid unnecessary securitization and promote effective de-escalation. Secondly, resources should be significantly expended towards understanding inceldom as a life situation. The result will be a wider and better understanding of incels at large, as well as a more accurate portrayal of the community to the public.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-travis-ci">What is Travis-CI?<a href="#what-is-travis-ci" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Well, TravisCI is what we call a Continuous Integration(CI) tool. CI is a practice of merging in small code changes frequently instead of doing it at the end of a development cycle where there is a ton of code and you are bound to run into issues which will be harder to debug.
But, having to do frequent changes makes it harder to run tests and deploy it to your server and that’s where Travis steps in. Travis makes it easier to automate your building, deploying and testing stages.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Travis clones your GitHub repository into a new virtual environment and carries out the series of tasks you write out in your Travis testing file.(.travis.yml)</p>
<p>To learn more about the builds &amp; job lifecycle, check out these two posts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/#builds-stages-jobs-and-phases">Builds, Stages, Jobs and Phases</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle/#the-job-lifecycle">The Job Lifecycle</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="our-goals">Our Goals<a href="#our-goals" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>Deploy to a server.</li>
<li>Run any required scripts on the server if required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions<a href="#assumptions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>You are using GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-time-travis-setup">First-time Travis setup<a href="#first-time-travis-setup" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>If it’s your first time using Travis then you need to define what OS, distribution and/or language your virtual environment will be using. For example:</p>
<pre><code>  os: linux
  dist: bionic
  language: python
  python:
    -'3.7'
</code></pre><p>To read more about this, check out <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci-using-github">Travis’ Getting Started Guide</a> and <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/">Building a Python Project Guide</a> or the guide specific to what programming language you want to use.</p>
<h2 id="setup-ssh-encryption-keys">Setup SSH encryption keys<a href="#setup-ssh-encryption-keys" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>To be able to deploy and run commands on server, you need to have SSH access to it which means you will need an SSH keypair but of course we can’t leave our private key lying around in our repository for everyone to see, so we need to encrypt it so that only the Travis CI can read it. For that, we need to use the Travis CLI to encrypt our files. <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/">Here’s the relevant Travis Documentation page for it.</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Install Travis</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$ gem install travis</code></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Log-in to Travis and authorise your GitHub account with it</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$ travis login --com</code></p>
<p>The com argument is because we are using travis-ci.com and not travis-ci.org, make sure you are careful around the documentation since travis-ci.com and travis-ci.org have a few differences. <a href="https://devops.stackexchange.com/a/4305">Here is an answer on StackOverflow explaining what the difference is.</a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set up SSH keypair</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Generate the keypair</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'build@travis-ci.com' -f ./deploy_rsa</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypt the deploy_rsa file</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ travis encrypt-file deploy_rsa --add</code></p>
<p>The <code>--add</code> flag automatically adds the required lines in the .travis.yml file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Public SSH key on server</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ ssh-copy-id -i deploy_rsa.pub &lt;USERNAME&gt;@&lt;DEPLOY-HOSTNAME&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>DELETE the keypair</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ rm -f deploy_rsa deploy_rsa.pub</code></p>
<p>This is very IMPORTANT, make sure that the private key is not on the repository.</p>
<p>Your .travis.yml file must be looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>addons:
  ssh_known_hosts: &lt;DEPLOY-HOSTNAME&gt;

before_deploy:
- openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_&lt;...&gt;_key -iv $encrypted_&lt;...&gt;_iv -in deploy_rsa.enc -out /tmp/deploy_rsa -d
- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
- chmod 600 /tmp/deploy_rsa
- ssh-add /tmp/deploy_rsa
</code></pre><p>Alright, before we go ahead with deployment, lets add some secrets to the repository, you can do it two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Travis CLI tool:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>$ travis encrypt --pro SOMEVAR="secretvalue"</code></p>
<p>But, that adds the values in the .travis.yml file which looks kinda ugly so I chose to add it using the travis-ci.com website, it really depends on what you want to do.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Using the travis-ci.com website</li>
</ol>
<p>..* Go to your TravisCI dashboard and pick the repository you want to work with. Click on the “More Options” hamburger menu and go into settings. There you will see an Environment Variables section, add your server’s HOSTNAME and USERNAME to it just so you don’t reveal your IP address in the .travis.yml file. ;)</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment<a href="#deployment" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Before we start writing the deployment script, it would be nice to create a <code>scripts/</code> folder and then place a <code>deploy.sh</code> file in that folder. Yes, the deployment script is just a single line but it would be easier to add more commands in there without populating up the <code>.travis.yml</code> file.</p>
<p>The single line you would use to deploy is:</p>
<p><code>ssh -i /tmp/deploy_rsa $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME "cd &lt;repo-directory&gt;; git pull origin &lt;branch-name&gt;"</code></p>
<p>We need to put this script somewhere in the .travis.yml file, but it can’t be just anywhere. We need to follow Travis’ build lifecycle events. So, we will use the deploy script lifecycle event which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>deploy:
    - provider: script
      skip_cleanup: true
      script:  scp -r $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME:/path/to/repository/files
      on:
      branch: master
</code></pre><p>Or, if you created a separate <code>scripts/deploy.sh</code>, add the single <code>scp</code> command to the deploy.sh file and then your deploy script would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>deploy:
    - provider: script
      skip_cleanup: true
      script: bash scripts/deploy.sh
      on:
        branch: master
</code></pre><p>That’s all for deployment and if you want to run any commands post deployment, you could add an extra line in your deploy script:</p>
<p><code>ssh -i /tmp/deploy_rsa $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME  "cd &lt;repo-directory&gt;; &lt;run any command(s) or script(s)&gt;;"</code></p>
<p>Make sure there aren’t any process that linger or else the command will not exit and the build will fail.</p>
<h3 id="finishing-up-the-script">Finishing up the script<a href="#finishing-up-the-script" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Just above both the <code>before_deploy:</code> stage you would include a <code>jobs:</code> section since the <code>jobs:</code> section entails a sequence of stages, i.e., your <code>before_deploy:</code> and <code>deploy:</code> stage.</p>
<p>It would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
    include:
      - stage: deploy
        if: branch = master AND type != pull_request
        script: skip
</code></pre><p>What this does is that it runs the script only on a push to master and NOT if it’s a pull request.</p>
<p>If you want to deploy multiple branches, you could add an extra condition, for example:
<code>if: branch = master OR branch=testing AND type != pull_request</code></p>
<p>And your deploy script would look like:</p>
<pre><code>deploy:
       - provider: script
         skip_cleanup: true
         script: bash scripts/deploy_master.sh
         on:
           branch: master
       - provider: script
         skip_cleanup: true
         script: bash scripts/deploy_testing.sh
         on:
           branch: testing
</code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I hope you were able to understand how Travis works, its workflow and how it makes it very easy to deploy and run things without putting in much effort.</p>
<p>Make sure to put some time reading the Travis Documentation, they are really good and it will generally help you do things properly and make the entire process much more effortless.</p>
<p>For example, if someone creates a pull request but their code is really ugly and not properly linted, or want to run tests to make sure nothing broken is being pushed to master, you could add an extra linting and testing stage just above the deploy stage. It would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
   include:
   - stage: flake8 test
     if: type = pull_request
     script: flake8 .
</code></pre><p>This runs a flake8 styling test and if the code doesn’t abibe by it, the Travis build will fail.</p>
<p>Here’s an example .travis.yml that I use to push a <a href="https://github.com/Super-Serious/bot">Telegram Bot written in Python</a> to a server:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Super-Serious/bot/blob/master/.travis.yml">https://github.com/Super-Serious/bot/blob/master/.travis.yml</a></p>

            <p><span>2020-07-25</span></p><p>I just put <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/resume.md">resume.md on GitHub</a>. It’s
a Makefile and some CSS that builds a HTML and PDF version of a resume from
plain Markdown source.</p>
<p>Plain text source has all the usual benefits (plays nice with version control,
diff, grep, etc.), but this approach has the additional advantage that it has
very light dependencies: two pure Python packages that can be pip installed
(<a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">python-markdown</a> and
<a href="https://weasyprint.org/">weasyprint</a>). You don’t need pandoc or LaTeX.</p>
<p>To use it: clone the repository, install the dependencies, edit the
file
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.md">resume.md</a>
(which is very simple vanilla Markdown), then run <code>make</code>. You’ll get
a HTML file that looks like this <img src="https://mike.place/post/resume.md/resume.png" alt="Screenshot ofresume.html">
and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.pdf">PDF that looks very
similar</a>.
Edit the CSS to change fonts, spacing, layout, etc. See <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/resume.md">the README for

<h2>TRIPUTER</h2>

<p>
I bought in September 2016 an FPGA development board called <b>Cyclone V GX Starter Kit</b> from
<a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/" target="_blank">Terasic</a> (see Figure 1). It costs 179 US$ and uses
a 28-nm FPGA with six 3.125 Gbps transceiver channels from Altera. The board offers a 32-bit wide LPDDR2 DRAM 
memory with 512 Mbytes capacity. This device has a very high bandwidth for many applications. In addition the
board has a HDMI output, an audio device, an SD card interface, many LEDs and switches and some expansion
connectors.
</p>

<p>
The plan is to realize with this board a "multiple computer" system. The name TRIPUTER is an indication of how
many systems will be integrated. The first one will be the PC532 running NetBSD. The second one will be the
Ceres-3 using Oberon. Currently the last one will be the BBC computer with the 32016 Second Processor.
</p>

<p>
Using a commercial board for this purpose is the best choice. Nevertheless the board is not ideal. For example it
lacks an Ethernet port and a real time clock. But it is cheap and the used FPGA is a modern one which will be available
for many years. The missing features can be added through the expansion connectors. I will develop the necessary
hardware for it too. 
</p>

<p>
The three computers to be integrated are very different from a software point of view. Having them available in one
system should be an exciting experience. The FPGA of the board is big enough to hold the required hardware.
</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1. The initial configuration of the Cyclone V GX Starter Kit is presenting a photo of itself on the screen</p>

<p>
Of course such a complex system is not build over night. But as time goes by the fourth milestone is now achieved
:-)
</p>

<p><img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/Trip_1.jpg"></p>

<p><img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/Trip_2.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig. 3. The hardwired VT100 terminal of TRIPUTER V0.3 shows the boot process of NetBSD.</p>

<h3>Milestone 4 : TRIPUTER V0.3 is available =&gt; updated to V0.33 again due to some issues in the VT100 terminal
emulation.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> version 0.33 of TRIPUTER contains the PC632M system running NetBSD with an SD card. Still this
system uses the USB connection for the RS232 interface. The image for the SD card is available at
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/NetBSD.html">Software/NetBSD</a>. The <a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V033.zip">V0.33 zip archive</a>
contains the following files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRIPUTER_V033.sof , the FPGA configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V033.pof , the flash configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V033.pdf , the User Manual
  </li><li>output_file.cof , the definition file for Quartus to generate a new pof file
  </li><li>ans32k.exe , the Series 32000 crossassembler for Windows
  </li><li>monitor.32K , the source code of the TRIPUTER MONITOR program
  </li><li>mon_auto.hex , the hex file of the monitor program for PC532
  </li><li>two application programs and a readme.txt
</li></ul>

<p>
The date of the zip-file is 11 May 2019.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> done.</p>

<h3>October 2019 : the PERI board is available!</h3>

<p>
The PERI board is an IO board which brings to the FPGA board some necessary extensions: a true RS232 interface,
a real time clock (RTC), two PS2 ports for mouse and keyboard, a second SD card connector and a 100 Mbit Ethernet
interface. All of these things are now operational. One port is not yet usable: SATA. The hardware is there, but
the verilog code for this challenging interface must still be written.
</p>

<p>
Figure 4 shows the PERI board in action.
</p>

<p><img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PERI.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig. 4. The PERI board with the serial number 1 is attached to the Cyclone V GX Starter Kit. 2 of the 3 LEDs of
the Ethernet interface are active.</p>

<p>
The purpose of PERI is to transform the Starter Kit into a standalone computer. Then all the planned systems can
be implemented.
</p>

<p>
To test the functions of the PERI board I have made a new version of TRIPUTER: it is V0.9 . The 
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V09.zip">V0.9 zip archive</a> contains only three files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRIPUTER_V09.pof , the flash configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V09.pdf , the User Manual
  </li><li>monitor.32K , the source code of the TRIPUTER MONITOR program
</li></ul>

<p>
The system can only test PERI if the flash is being configured with the pof file. Then some software is available.
I hope that V0.9 will be replaced soon with a version which enables SATA...
</p>

<h3>Milestone 5 : TRIPUTER V1.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V1.0 will be the first system that uses all features of the PERI board. It will emulate
the PC532, run NetBSD from a SATA device and will have an Ethernet interface for easy down- and uploading of big
files.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<h3>Milestone 6 : TRIPUTER V2.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V2.0 will contain the Ceres-3 and the PC532.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<h2>PC532</h2>

<p>
The PC532 is an interesting story. Beginning of the 1990's some people tried to build a NS32532 based computer
system. Finally they were successful. The number of systems build was quite low compared to industrial standards. But
nevertheless around 150 boards were build and shiped to enthusiastic NS32000 fans. The operating system used was
NetBSD version 1.5.3 at least.
</p>

<p>
I saw my first PC532 at the Vintage Computer Festival (VCFe) in 2003. Figure 1 shows the system.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Later I came into contact with another PC532 owner. Unfortunately his system is no longer functional. On the next
photo you can see not only the board but some probes from an oscilloscope. I tried to bring it up again.
But at the end I was not successful :-(

<p>It is difficult to measure something inside a computer with an oscilloscope. Obviously a logic analyzer is much more
helpful. If the system does nothing during booting
one can check some control signals after reset is released. In this case the CPU seems to make something wrong.
Therefore I decided to exchange this chip.</p>

<p>Fig. 3. A view of the PC532 board.</p>

<p>
To exchange the CPU I took the pcb out of the case. On top of the CPU you can see a fan. The owner of this
PC532 told me that his system was running at 30 MHz and the CPU got hot. Therefore the fan was necessary. My own NS32532
is running at 25 MHz with a heat-sink only. Four serial ports are available with two UARTs from Signetics. The IC from
Adaptec is a SCSI controller which was used for the HDD.

<p>Fig. 4. A close up view of the heart of the PC532.</p>

<p>
Figure 4 shows the NS32532 CPU, now the fan is removed, the NS32381 FPU and 8 Mbytes of partity protected DRAM. Surprisingly
the CPU and FPU were 25 MHz rated devices. Clocking them with 30 MHz is 20 %
overclocking and maybe something died inside one chip due to the permanent overload. As a first step I replaced the 60 MHz
oscillator with a 50 MHz one. The oscillator is sitting below the NS32381 FPU.
</p>

<p>Fig. 5. Trying to break out the NS32532 CPU.</p>

<p>
This was very strange! I tried to get the CPU out of its socket but nothing helped. At least I build a special construction
which you can see in figure 5. But I hesitated to apply as much force as I could. The board was already bending and
damaging the board was not an option! At the end I packed everything together and gave the PC532 back. Unrepaired.

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>
Some documents about the hardware of the PC532 are available. The schematics together with the PAL equations give a good
overview of the design.

<p>Real entrepreneurs ship, don’t ever forget that. An idea is worthless until it has been translated and executed into a tangible product that your potential customers can use. Getting from inception of an idea all the way to shipping it seems like a pretty straight forward process, but so is war- get guns, tanks, draw a strategy, invade, and take over. When you get caught up in the heat of a battle, I’m sure what seemed simple on the surface, isn’t so simple after all. Gunfire has a way of doing that. Shipping a product that customers want is kind of the same thing. The gunfire of confusion, resisting feature creep, and not having a defined process can make taking an idea from inception to shipping it terribly difficult. I was guilty of this with my first startup, Publictivity. <strong> Never ever again. </strong> I often get asked about the topic, so here’s the exact blueprint I follow. This is how I go about taking a product from inception all the way to shipping it as well as having paying customers lined up. I will use examples from two products I’m currently working on <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> (shipped, profitable, 100+ customers, and version two on its way) and <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'Cloudomatic(flow) ']);">Cloudomatic(flow) </a> (early alpha testing, shipping soon for mass consumption, 150+ customers lined up for launch).</p>
<h2>Step 1: Define The Problem</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with ideas is the fact that they don’t really solve a problem. All too often entrepreneurs go about creating cool things that don’t solve a real problem. By defining the problem, it helps you clarify what you’re building and why. Defining the problem gives you constraints around feature creep. It lets you say “Does this feature or functionality add anything that is core to solving the problem?” You would be surprised how many features make it into products that have absolutely nothing to do with solving the problem.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> I just bought my iPad, started blogging more heavily, and wanted to make sure my blog was optimized for the tablet format. I certainly wasn’t going to make a native iPad app. At first I thought I would just modify my existing theme by removing dropdowns, increasing the size of the font,etc. Well yeah, that did not work out too well. <strong> Problem: No easy way for publishers to make their content Tablet friendly using their existing CMS (in my case WordPress). </strong></p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> We created Cloudomatic.com in a weekend. Revenue model was simple: drive traffic, integrate affiliate links, make a very nice commission as SaaS has a very nice ARPU. It turns out that very few SaaS developers had an affiliate program. As former SaaS guys ourselves, we looked around and understood why: existing stuff was too complex, didn’t work with subscription services, and devs were too busy to build it themselves. <strong> Problem: No easy way for web app developers to get setup with a simple affiliate program in under an hour. </strong></p>
<h2>Step 2: High Level Overview Specifications and Mockups</h2>
<p>At this point you probably know what you want to build and specifically what problem the app is meant to solve. From here you start to define the solution to the problem stated above. How will the app specifically solve this problem? What is the secret sauce? The high level specifications should be 1-2 pages at MOST. This is something that a normal human being should be able to read and define specific important features. It’s really the skeleton for the technical outline of your app. In short, it should be enough for photoshop mockups or even just wireframes created with Balsamiq.</p>
<p>When creating mockups and wireframes don’t focus on fleshing out every last detail or every last little screen ie- the reset password screen or some obscure settings page. Instead, pick maybe 4-5 different screens that show the key functionality of the app. You’re prepping yourself for initial customer feedback and validation, so pick the screens that are going to convince them and get the point across that your solution is solving the problem you have defined.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a>, I spent a fair amount of time looking at the native iPad applications major publishers had put out such as USA Today, BBC, Financial Times,etc. I also had a list of specific functionality that I knew was crucial. Simple page design, large fonts, accelerometer aware, touch navigation, swiping to advance were some of them. I also defined the way that integration should work with WordPress. This was more of a technical issue, but it was also key to adoption. For mockups I basically screenshotted from my iPad, photoshopped a bunch of different things together, and also took videos of the touch interactions that were key.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> With <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> we basically locked ourselves down for an entire weekend to get through steps 1-3. I defined everything that was needed from the both the developer standpoint and the affiliate end. From there we translated that into the 4 most important separate screens that had an overview of what the app would do- overview dashboard, define payment plans coordinated with your app, and what the interface looks like for an actual affiliate.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Initial Customer Feedback and Validation</h2>
<p>This is a really crucial step and it might be a really depressing or exciting step. At this point you now have something that you can show potential customers to have them say: “This is interesting, I would use it and/or would pay you for it.” You should probably synthesize the simple specs into some type of sales literature or at least something a normal person can read. The mockups should be fine as is. If you’re using wireframes, just explain that this is for feedback purposes only and a very rough idea of what is being built.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept things really rough and also took a risk by playing things close to the chest. We basically explained what the app would do in simple terms: Take your existing WordPress install, if a user accesses your blog from their iPad web browser, it behaves like a native iPad app. We highlighted major features that drove this point home and showed what were some God awful mockups. They were frankshops of many different apps we thought made sense, but it got the point across. Enough bloggers told us this would be useful and that they would pay for it. So we soldiered on.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> was an interesting beast from this perspective. It went way better than we thought it would. This was a very public customer feedback/validation phase using what’s called an MVP smoke test ie- the product isn’t fully built, but gauge consumer feedback as if it is there. The goal was to see if we would get sign-ups, but we also indicated in the confirmation email that if you wanted to be fast tracked into the beta that you could email us indicating so. This let us do a few things a) see how badly some people wanted the product b) have some initial individuals we could reach out to in order to make sure we were building the most critical features first c) set priorities for sending out actual invites when the time came. The site at <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'flow.cloudomatic.com ']);">flow.cloudomatic.com </a>is the same exact site, screenshots,etc. that we used for this phase if you want to see what was actually there.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Be An Axe Murderer</h2>
<p>Guess what? You’re probably doing too much even with the simple initial spec and mockups that you put together. Besides validating the problem and your specific solution, talking to potential customers allows you to find out which features are really crucial and which ones are nice to have. Start killing off things you don’t need right away and leave them to Version 1.1,etc., but also make sure the really important ones have a very high priority. By doing this, your app will be left to the most core and essential features. This will make it easier to get the product in the hands of your customers AND it will also make you laser focused on the things that truly matter to your customers.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept the features that stuck with the core vision of making the app feel native as opposed to adding things that would have been publisher/blogging specific. We don’t have comments right now and probably won’t until we can do them right to integrate with the experience. We could have easily just included the comment div, but it wasn’t worth keeping a half assed feature.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> Cloudomatic(flow) is really really simple. We reduced it down to a few API calls and a Javascript embed. There are a lot of features we’ll add in the future for conversions, advanced affiliate management, reseller management,etc. We basically only went with features that focused on the core problem at hand: a) Specifically working with recurring subscriptions for SaaS b) Making integration take less than an hour for SaaS developers by reducing things to a few simple API calls. We also reduced the payout options from every provider under the sun to the most requested one: PayPal</p>
<h2>Step 5: Detailed Specifications</h2>
<p>Detailed specs are like your blueprint for the app, and shouldn’t be rushed. You can’t think of every scenario until you start building + testing it, but you can certainly try. When you’re working with a multiperson team, you don’t have time to wait for email responses, second guess, or hold things up. If it’s in the specs, you know where to go. It also helps keep scope creep away. My specs also include the database structure and design as well.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed’s ']);"> …</a></p></section></article></div></div>

      <p> <em>Published: </em> 07/26/2020</p>

      <p>I hate it when I run across what is reported to be an epic hack involving Russians, Chinese or spies only it turns out the hacking victims were not taking any form of basic security seriously. Its like asking Bonnie and Clyde to rob a bank where the combo is printed on a large banner outside the vault and there are no keys to any safe deposit boxes. Or it’s like letting the fox get inside the hen house.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the victims in this case seem to be the US Government. The article is titled: <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/russia-russian-hacking-elections-illinois/3778816/">“How the Russians penetrated Illinois election computers - ABC7 Chicago”</a>.</p>

<p>What was the hack? SQL injection. SQL INJECTION!!@!@!! What the #$%@? Are we living in the 90s? What the heck are developers doing? Sadly, I’ve encountered the problem on projects I’ve worked on within the last YEAR. WTF is wrong with people? Are we lazy or stupid or a bit of both?</p>



<p>Here’s an innocent query; let’s say we’re using Postgres and NodeJS</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>firstName</span><span>,</span> <span>lastName</span><span>,</span> <span>email</span> <span>From</span> <span>users</span> <span>where</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>"adam@adambourg.com"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad, but lets see how we can build it in Javascript:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>throw</span> <span>"</span><span>Email address is required!</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>any</span><span>(</span><span>`SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = "</span><span>${</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>}</span><span>"`</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a simple method to ensuring we have an email and fetching a user record from the database. The trouble is, we’re doing string interpolation, meaning we take that query and inject ANYTHING from the emailAddress variable. No big deal, right?</p>

<p>What if email address is this:</p>



<p>That means it would match on the first value, 1, which probably won’t match anything or on 1=1 which is literally interpreted by SQL as does 1 equal 1? Which is always true. Thus would return EVERY record in the system.</p>



<p>Assume the hacker has no knowledge of the system and does this:</p>



<p>Now I’ve got a list of all the records in the table; great, what if I want to know what options are present in the system? Well, do this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>'; SELECT c.relname FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace WHERE c.relkind IN (‘r’,”) AND n.nspname NOT IN (‘pg_catalog’, ‘pg_toast’) AND pg_catalog.pg_table_is_visible(c.oid); 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Version?</p>



<p>Postgres users?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>'; SELECT usename FROM pg_user;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Users and password hashes? No problem:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>'; SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_shadow — priv;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the thing if you don’t sanitize your inputs, you are venerable to so many easy hacks. In fact there are <a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/postgres-sql-injection-cheat-sheet">many</a>, <a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/mysql-sql-injection-cheat-sheet">dozens</a> of <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database">different</a> <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/sql-injection-cheat-sheet/">guides</a> on <a href="https://www.sqlinjection.net/table-names/">any</a> and <a href="https://download.oracle.com/oll/tutorials/SQLInjection/index.htm">all</a> <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-05/bh-us-05-fayo.pdf">versions</a> of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-injection?view=sql-server-ver15">SQL</a>.</p>



<p>Unlike the idiots in Chicago, buying an expensive Cisco Firewall will not do anything to protect you. In fact, it will only cause you to feel more secure thus take more risks. No what you need is real security. Basic security. It’s like putting a lock on your door type of security.</p>



<p>Just about every SQL library supports Parameterized Queries. If they don’t you need to find a new lib to use.</p>

<p>Example in PQ:</p>

<p>Given our example from above, here’s what a safe query would look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>throw</span> <span>"</span><span>Email address is required!</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>any</span><span>(</span><span>`SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = "$emailAddress"`</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>emailAddress</span><span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, that was simple! Basically $ with out the brackets are treated as a normal string, you can keep the string template literal (the back ticks) or use quotes instead; then you’re dumping email address into an object that gets passed to the db’s any method which does all the work.</p>

<p>This works:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>adam@adambourg.com</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does not work as the hacker expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>lookupUserByEmail</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>1 or 1=1;</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>A few examples of the method body in other languages using this safe method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$stmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>$dbh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>prepare</span><span>(</span><span>"SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = (?)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>$stmt</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bindParam</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>$email</span><span>);</span>
<span>$stmt</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>execute</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>String</span> <span>sqlQuery</span> <span>=</span> <span>"SELECT firstName, lastName, email From users where email = (?)"</span><span>;</span>
<span>PreparedStatement</span> <span>prepStmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>conn</span><span>.</span><span>prepareStatement</span><span>(</span><span>sqlQuery</span><span>);</span>
<span>prepStmt</span><span>.</span><span>setString</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"adam@adambourg.com"</span><span>);</span>
<span>prepStmt</span><span>.</span><span>executeUpdate</span><span>();</span>
<span>prepStmt</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Active Record does right out of the box; it’s automatic, similar for Sequelize. Should you turn it off, like this <a href="https://medium.com/@devinburnette/be-prepared-7768d1a111e1">idiot says</a>? Hell NO!</p>



<p>If you want to dive more into this topic, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp">W3 Schools</a> has a really good guide to injections.</p>

<p>Programs from nice people sometimes ask for your permission. This is because a developer choose to do so.</p>

<p>There may also be laws that could punish them if they get caught choosing differently.</p>

<hr>

<p>What about programs of which the authors choose differently? Well, such program could do quite a bit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It could access any of your files, modify them, delete them, or upload them. This also applies to the internal files used by other applications.</li>
  <li>It could install other programs in the background.</li>
  <li>It could talk to other devices linked to your home network.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-atstake">What is at&nbsp;stake</h2>

<p>Files you might not be thinking about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The cookies in your web browser.</li>
  <li>Desktop applications. Chat history, password managers, todo lists, etc. They all use files to store the text and media you send or receive.</li>
  <li>Digital media. Your photo albums, home videos, and voice memos.</li>
  <li>SSH private keys, GPG key rings, and other crypto files used by developers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="browser-cookies">Browser cookies</h2>

<p>Browsers cookies make it so you’re immediately logged-in when you open a new tab for Gmail, or Twitter. An evil program can copy the browser’s cookies file and share it with the attacker.</p>

<p>They could then read any e-mail you’ve ever received or sent stored there. It could also delete any. (Got a backup?) They can naturally access future e-mails as well. Like the ones you get from “Forgot password” buttons. They could also hide any trace of these (e.g. filter rules).</p>

<p>This affects any website you use. Social network? Access to any post or DM — regardless of privacy setting. Company e-mail, Google Drive? That too.</p>

<h2 id="sleeper-programs">Sleeper programs</h2>

<p>The evil program may configure itself to always start in the background when you open your laptop. A new friend for life!</p>

<p>It could also add local command-line programs that wrap the popular <code>sudo</code> and <code>ssh</code> commands, to make them do a little extra behind the scenes. Next time you run <code>sudo &lt;something&gt;</code> to perform an administrator action and enter your password—you may have given away full system access. Deploying some code? Running <code>ssh cloud.someplace.special</code> might let the attacker tailgate along with you, opening one shell for itself and another for you.</p>

<h2 id="local-webserver">Local web&nbsp;server</h2>

<p>These background programs could also affect you in a myriad of other ways. I won’t detail those today, except to mention they can keep a local web server running. Spotify and Zoom have been seen in the news doing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5">questionable things</a> with their local web servers.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="is-this-an-npmproblem">Is this an npm&nbsp;problem?</h2>

<p>Maybe. Technically these concerns apply to any method of executing unknown code. Running <code>npm install</code> isn’t very different from pasting a command like <code>curl url… | bash</code>. They both execute a downloaded program from your terminal. The difference is in user expectation.</p>

<p>Upon seeing the url and the <code>bash</code> invocation, you have a choice: Trust the publisher (the url), or trust the script (download, review, then decide whether to run). The result is generally predictable and without hidden dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="other-packagemanagers">Other package&nbsp;managers</h3>

<p>What about Debian (apt-get) or Homebrew? Like npm, code published there is unknown to most of us and hard to review. But, there is an important difference: Peer-review. These traditional repositories are curated by a central authority. You don’t have to trust the script or original authors of each package, so long as you trust the publishers and their curation process.</p>

<h3 id="the-scale-has-changed-thegame">The scale has changed the&nbsp;game</h3>

<p>What about PyPI or Packagist (Composer)? These are like npm. Anyone can publish anything. There is however a difference in scale. PyPI has 194K projects. Packagist is host to 237K packages with 0.5 billion downloads a month. npm has over 1.3 million packages and 30 <em>billion</em> downloads a month. This makes it a much more popular target. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pypi.org/">[1]</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://packagist.org/statistics">[2]</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180868064080/this-year-in-javascript-2018-in-review-and-npms">[3]</a></p>

<h3 id="dependency-graphs">Dependency graphs</h3>

<p>There is also a difference in habit: PyPI packages have 7 dependencies on average, with typically 1 indirect dependency. And, I would expect most dependencies there to be from authors the user has trusted before. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://snyk.io/blog/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-how-packages-behave-on-the-npm-registry/">[4]</a> Snyk.io published in April that the average npm package has a whopping 86 dependencies, with a 4+ levels of indirect dependencies. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://snyk.io/blog/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-how-packages-behave-on-the-npm-registry/">[4]</a></p>

<p>The ESLint package has 118 npm dependencies <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/eslint/6.3.0">[5]</a>. Eleventy, a popular static site generator, requires 555 dependencies (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/%254011ty%252Feleventy/0.9.0">Explore dependency graph</a>). Each one of these may run <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.alexwendland.com/2018-11-20-npm-install-scripts-intro/">arbitrary shell commands</a> from the terminal both during the installation process, after later when using the tool.</p>

<h2 id="i-get-it-now-what-can-we-do-aboutit">I get it. Now, what can we do about&nbsp;it?</h2>

<p>There isn’t a magic bullet to make everything perfectly safe. But, there are a number of things you can do to reduce risk.</p>

<h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3>

<p>For the past year, I’ve been using disposable Docker containers as a way to reduce the risk of compromise. It has controls for network access, and for which directories can be exposed. Docker isn’t a perfect safety net by any means, but it’s a step in the right direction.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://timotijhof.net/assets/attachments/2019_npm_Servers.jpg" alt="Earth is small compared to Jupiter. Jupiter is roughly 11 times larger."></p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My base image uses Debian and comes with Node.js, npm, and a few other utilities (such as headless browsers, for automated tests). I use a bash script to launch a temporary container, based on that image. It runs as the unprivileged <code>nobody</code> user, and mounts only the current working directory.</p>

<p>From there, I would run <code>npm install</code> and such. The only thing it interacts with is the source code and local <code>node_modules</code> directory for that specific project. It isn’t given access to any other Git repos, desktop apps, browser cookies, or crypto files. And, once that terminal tab is closed, the container is destroyed.</p>

<p>I’ve published the script I use at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/wikimedia/fresh#start-of-content">github.com/wikimedia/fresh</a>. I don’t recommend using it outside Wikimedia, however. Create your own instead. The repository explains <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/wikimedia/fresh/blob/19.10.1/Tutorial.md">how it works</a>.</p>

<p>Other options for isolating your environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Speed and flexibility: Use <code>systemd-nspawn</code> or <code>chroot</code>. This takes more work to setup, but provides a faster environment than Docker. In terms of security it is comparable to Docker. Read more systemd-nspan on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-nspawn">ArchWiki</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security and ease of use: Use a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox/Vagrant). This is more secure by default and offers a GUI for controlling what to expose. The downside is that VMs are significantly slower.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fewer-dependencies">Fewer dependencies</h3>

<p>Finally, you can reduce risk by reducing the number of packages you depend on in your projects (and then shrink-wrap them). Especially development dependencies, as these tend to be explicitly aimed at executing from the CLI.</p>

<p>Question yourself and question others before introducing new dependencies. Perhaps even encourage maintainers of your favourite packages to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/1342#show_issue">Reduce the size of their dependency graph</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>MinIO supports a complete object locking framework offering both Legal Hold and Retention (with Governance and Compliance modes). Object Locking functionality is a requirement for many regulated industries from financial services to healthcare. <br></p><p>Lifecycle management is an increasingly critical element in the data ecosystem. Data is the primary asset in most organizations at this point - more so than the physical assets we normally associate with large enterprises - trains, planes, automobiles or oil rigs. Protecting this data, and managing how long to protect it are complex challenges. <br></p><p>MinIO now offers the complete suite of lifecycle management capabilities. This includes versioning, object locking and the various derivative components. Every use case is different and our goal is to create software and documentation that allow our community to implement these features with confidence. <br></p><p>Our approach models Amazon’s. This is important for a number of reasons. First, for companies seeking compatibility for their applications, the same S3 API calls that work in the public cloud need to work on premises. Second, Amazon took a measured approach to the problem, considered all of the corner cases and built a strong offering. We acknowledge a debt there. Third, given Amazon’s leadership there is strong adoption of this in the approach and most of the issues have been resolved. <br></p><p>Even with Amazon’s leadership, not a lot of companies have implemented this feature. We are pleased to add our name to the list. Given the other attributes of our software, we think this removes any hesitation around adopting MinIO as your private cloud object store. <br></p><p>Having immutability and protection from deletion ensures that your data assets are safe.<br></p><p><strong>Versioning</strong><br></p><p>Versioning allows a user to retain multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. Versioning provides a mechanism to &nbsp;preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket. Versioning ensures that objects remain available across a range of failures from applications to human error. <br></p><p>Versioning is enabled at the bucket level. When enabled, MinIO automatically creates a unique version ID for the object. There can be multiple versions of the same object. <br></p><p>One of the main benefits of versioning is to protect overwriting it or deleting it unintentionally. This is performed using the concept of a delete marker. When a versioned object is deleted it is not removed permanently. Rather a delete marker is created and becomes the current version of the object. When that object is read it returns a 404 Not Found message.<br></p><p>Objects that have the delete marker can be restored. <br></p><p>Along the same lines, if a versioned object is overwritten, it creates a new version and that becomes the current version. Again, the older version can be restored as needed. <br></p><p>To account for these changes there are now three bucket states in MinIO. Unversioned which is the default, versioning-enabled, or versioning-suspended. Please note that once a bucket is enabled for versioning, that action cannot be undone - only suspended. Versioning is a global setting within the bucket - meaning all objects are now versioned. <br></p><p>Users with appropriate permissions can suspend versioning to stop accruing object versions. This is applicable only for that bucket and not for other buckets. For more information on what happens in this case refer to the documentation. <br></p><p>As with all of MinIO, versioning can be applied using the MinIO Client (mc), the SDK or via the command line. <br></p><p>Versioning is the simplest way to protect data from unintended actions. It does have the effect of adding to bucket sizes as objects are versioned and can lead to a higher number of interdependencies between the objects as well as the risk of hidden object dependencies. This can be mitigated with Lifecycle Management Choices. Still, for most organizations, this is a reasonable tradeoff for data protection. <br></p><p>There are, however, other use cases, that require another level of certainty. <br></p><p><strong>Object Locking, Retention and Legal Holds</strong><br></p><p>Object locking is a key feature for those companies operating in regulatory environments or having forward thinking policies around retention, audit or other compliance related requirements. We will be publishing our final Cohasset Report shortly but have a favorable assessment in hand. <br></p><p>This work builds on our previous feature set for write once, read many (WORM) - extending it as appropriate. As always, we took a minimalist approach - ensuring that it was feature complete without being feature-heavy and sapping performance. <br></p><p>While there are dozens of use cases, they can be effectively reduced to Legal Hold and Retention. Additionally there are modes, either Governance or Compliance and these have certain implications. There is some overlap here so we will do our best to be precise in our descriptions. <br></p><p><strong>Retention</strong><br></p><p>Retention ensures that an object is WORM protected (cannot be deleted or overwritten) for some period of time. It can be expressed in seconds, days or years. <br></p><p>Retention is set at the object level. You can place a retention period on an object version either explicitly or through a bucket default setting. A default lock configuration set at the bucket level does not apply retroactively to versions of objects created before. It only applies to objects that are created afterwards. &nbsp;When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version. The Retain Until Date setting is stored in the object version's metadata and protects the object version until the retention period expires. <br></p><p>When the bucket default setting is used, a Retain Until Date is not specified. Instead, a duration is set (either days or years), for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When a new object is placed in the bucket a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the object version's creation timestamp. The object version is then protected exactly as though it was explicitly locked with that retention period on the object version.<br></p><p>When you place a retention period on an object version, a timestamp is stored in the object version's metadata to indicate when the retention period expires. After the retention period expires, the object version can be deleted unless a legal hold was also placed on the object version.<br></p><p>Explicit retention mode and period specified while creating an object version always overrides the bucket default settings.<br></p><p>The retention period can be extended by submitting a new lock request. <br></p><p>There are two types of modes in the Retention framework:<br></p><p>Governance Mode<br></p><p>When setting a retention period for your objects or buckets Governance mode is used when the goal is to protect objects from being deleted by standard users. Having said that, there are users that will retain the permissions required to modify the retention settings or delete the objects. Those users will need the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission as well as the DeleteObject permission.<br></p><p>Compliance Mode<br></p><p>Compliance mode is more restrictive - it cannot be undone within the retention period. As a result, Compliance mode should be used when you are certain that you do not want anyone, including the root user, to be able to delete the objects during its retention period.<br></p><p><strong>Legal Hold</strong><br></p><p>Legal hold offers the same protection (WORM) as the retention period but it has no expiration date by default nor can one be set. It is an indefinite hold that can only be removed by an authorized user.</p><p><strong>Combo and Versioning </strong><br></p><p>While Retention and Legal Hold prevent objects from deletion or overwriting, they can overlap. An object version can have both retention and legal hold. Retention and legal hold apply to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.<br></p><p>Specifically, an object can have a retention period (call it six months) and a legal hold (indefinite). Even after the expiration of the retention period, the object version cannot be deleted because it still carries the legal hold. Only once the legal hold is lifted on that version of the object, can it be deleted. <br></p><p>While objects may have retention or legal hold, they can still be versioned. A copy operation on a version of an object does not carry forward the retention and legal hold settings that may be present on the source to the destination.</p><p><br>Here is a quick walk-through of a Legal Hold and Retention Period:</p><p>To use S3 Object Lock, follow these basic steps:<br></p><ol><li>Create a new bucket with Object Lock enabled.</li></ol><p><em><code>./mc mb myminio/testbucket --with-lock</code> </em></p><p>The command listed above creates a bucket that supports object locking.</p><p>(Optional) Configure a default retention period for objects placed in the bucket.</p><p><em><code>/mc bucket lock myminio/testbucket governance 100d</code></em></p><p>Place the objects that you want to lock in the bucket.</p><p><code>.<em>/mc cp /path/to/file myminio/testbucket</em></code></p><p>Apply a retention period, a legal hold, or both, to the objects that you want to protect.</p><p><em><code>./mc retention myminio/testbucket/file governance 1y</code></em></p><p><em><code>./mc legalhold myminio/testbucket/file on</code> </em></p><p>Pretty straightforward stuff. &nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br></p><p>The addition of these features adds another layer to our ever growing suite of enterprise capabilities. For banks and healthcare companies that were already using MinIO, these capabilities, supported by our Cohasset assessment, provide an additional suite of use cases to use with MinIO, expanding our reach within the organizations. <br></p><p>We encourage you to try out these features for yourself. &nbsp;We have documentation <a href="https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-bucket-object-lock-guide.html">here</a> and our <a href="https://minio.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-flxqy9og-K_cDBMh~yXq0rM9qktWFfQ#/">Slack channel</a> is always on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<!--  -->

<p>As a technical writer, I’m often the first person to use a new widget or whatsit without knowledge of its internal function or composition, so I get to act as a surrogate user. Sometimes I spot bugs or areas for improvement that my developer colleagues have not, but before those things have been revealed to our customers (though it’s a credit to the skill of my colleagues that this is an unusual occurrence). Thus, I get to write bug reports and feature requests on a somewhat frequent basis. And I’ve come to a recurring pattern for reports and requests that has proven successful at getting those problems fixed and those changes made.</p>

<p>So today I present to you, with considerable commentary, my outline for writing up a bug report or feature request. These guidelines aren’t definitive, but they represent the kind of requests I’ve sent or received that got results, with a minimum of back-and-forth.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Briefly summarize the request.</strong></p>

    <p>Ideally this should be no more than a few words. It should fit comfortably into the subject line of an email or your ticket tracker. This summary will probably become a mental shorthand that identifies a unit of work for somebody, so it’s kind to be terse. A terse summary often takes a simple form, such as <em>noun verbs the object</em> for a bug or <em>noun should verb the object</em> for a feature request.</p>

    <p>If you can’t complete this step, stop and think things over before continuing. You might have more than one problem on your hands. Narrow it down a little, or you might make the recipient an unwitting contestant in a game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions">Twenty Questions</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the current situation.</strong></p>

    <p>Provide a context to compare the proposed change with the status quo. If it’s a bug, provide the steps to reproduce the bug. If you can’t reliably reproduce it, describe (in as much detail as you can) the conditions under which the bug appeared. If it’s a feature, just briefly describe how things work right now.</p>

    <p>As both a reader and a writer, it’s easier to understand a proposal when there’s a contrast between the way things are and the way things you want them to be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the desired outcome.</strong></p>

    <p>In other words, ask for the change. Don’t forget to be polite.</p>

    <p>This is probably the thing that prompted you to start this process in the first place. If you’re requesting a bug fix, describe what you expected to happen. If you’re asking for a new feature, describe how a working implementation would behave.</p>

    <p>Unless you’re knowledgeable about the specific implementation details, don’t speculate about how easy, hard, simple, or complex the changes required may be. It’s neither as helpful nor as convincing as you imagine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the benefits of the change.</strong></p>

    <p>Justify your request. Describe how it will help your users, customers, or colleagues to live better, more pleasant lives. This is useful not just to convince the recipient to fulfill your request, but also to enable her to make an informed decision about which tasks to take on first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Describe the negative effects of the change.</strong></p>

    <p>If you can, describe how the change will require new effort or behavior on the part of your users, customers, or organization. You might suppose it’s counterproductive to describe the drawbacks of your proposed change, but ignoring drawbacks means ignoring opportunities to mitigate them. And occasionally you’ll have the good fortune to report that there’s no downside.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s a made up example, based on the outline, to request a new feature for Gmail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Feature request</strong>: Individual messages should have a delete button</p>

  <p>Presently, to delete a specific message in a Gmail conversation, you must click the down arrow menu button in the upper right corner of a message, then click “Delete this message.”</p>

  <p>Please add a button, perhaps alongside the existing forward button and down arrow menu button, that deletes the message in question when clicked.</p>

  <p>The button would speed up the process of handling individual notification messages that Gmail has erroneously grouped together as a conversation. It would reduce the number of clicks in such a situation by 50%.</p>

  <p>The addition of the button may cause some confusion for users when it first appears. During the adjustment period, some users may accidentally click the delete button and need to undo deletions more frequently than they would otherwise.</p>

  <p>Please let me know if you require any additional information. Thank you for taking the time consider my request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, it’s an iffy, high-risk feature—if I worked on Gmail, I’d probably reject it—but it contains some information on which to make that decision. On rejection, there’s an opportunity to identify alternatives, like fixing erroneous conversation grouping or providing a facility to split conversations. Those alternatives wouldn’t be apparent in a less detailed request, such as “Individual messages should have a delete button” alone. On acceptance, there’s enough information to determine what completion looks like (in this case, whether the implementation reduces clicks by 50%). Either way, a well-organized request makes it possible to find a good outcome.</p>

<p>And finding good outcomes is what making bug reports and feature requests is all about. So, with your help, we can make a less buggy, more useful tomorrow.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>At some point we had an issue with application startup performance.
For a bit of context this app runs in a Kubernetes cluster, with k8s it’s possible
to define a <em>rollout policy</em> to avoid service distruption, that what we had, so there’s a
rollout, new pods (a pod is composed of the application container) get created,
new application are started, then Kubernetes has a mean to check when the application is
<strong>ready</strong>, it’s called the readyness probe. This probe can be a call to http endpoint or a script,
ours is an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>WHen the probe indicates the application is ready, the application starts receiving traffic,
from this moment latencies increased from 10-20 milliseconds to seconds.</p>
<p>Opening the recording JMC, it will start an automated analysis. Sometime it’s helpful
and warning should be looked at. In this case the issue was elsewhere.</p>
<p>To help in our case, we need to go in the thread view, which as a <em>thread lanes</em>
which displays each thread as an horizontal bar, and JFR event are painted on the bar
at the time they happened and for how long. At the bottom there’s a the time axis.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 0 thread lanes">
</p>
<p>Thread Lanes</p>
</div>
<p>The first things that catch our eyes will be the vertical patterns, especially the one with
yellow and red around 12:51:15. Let’s zoom (you can select and right click, or use arrow keys.).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-threads-lanes-closer.png" alt="startup 0 threads lanes closer">
</p>
<p>Zooming on the problematic</p>
</div>
<p>The vertical pattern is more precise, these vertical pattern indicates a <em>cross
threads phenomena</em>. And we can notice that all thread are not affected the same way.</p>
<p>The lanes in green at the top indicates these threads are progressing normally, nothing’s
wrong with them. However is we go down there especially, the pattern materialize around
12:51:11.</p>
<p>Each color indicate some events</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gray ⇒ the thread does nothing, it’s parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small dark point ⇒ The park event, the thread was scheduled but was eventually parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red ⇒ In this case it’s a <em>blocked lock</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yellow ⇒ Here the yellow events that intrests us are thread waiting on a lock</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I’m not well versed in desfribing colors, so know that there are other events that use
a slightly different tone / shade of red, yellow or else. Just click on the event
to see what’s going on.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-lock-event.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis lock event">
</p>
<p>monitor blocked</p>
</div>
<p>The UI could be improved but going over the events shows a popup with it’s details,
for the Monitor Blocked event, there’s the duration this monitor was block, who held
this monitor before, and the monitor address in the heap.</p>
<p>This monitor was held for ~9s, that’s a big bottleneck !</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-acquire-blocked.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor acquire blocked">
</p>
</div>
<p>In this case we had ~200 thread competing for this lock in particular. And finding the thread that
acquired it is not automated, it’s a bit tedious, but in the end didn’t revealed anything.</p>
<p>However the Monitor Blocked event has another interesting element, the stacktrace. In the lower
pane of JMC, if the event is selected, we can see the stack trace where this event was emmitted.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-blocked-stack.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor blocked stack">
</p>
<p>jedis classloading</p>
</div>
<p>Here that’s the JDK classloader. I would never have thought that the JDK code would cause ~9s
contention. But looking at the stacktrace, there <em>jedis</em> (a Redis client) connection pool involved.
Maybe the class have static initialization that does IO, maybe it’s the agent that runs in production
that introduces latencies during this specific classlaoding.</p>
<p>But all the threads starts working again around 12:51:22, and redis bottle neck is not anymore an issue
afterward. Let’s look at the story on the IO side, open the Socket IO view.</p>
<p>Identify which one is related to redis, either via IP or via port (Redis is <code>6379</code>).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis-port.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis port">
</p>
<p>Socket IO with redis port selected</p>
</div>
<p>While we see a total time of 30s, it’s the accumulated time for all thread for the recording duration (6m).
So nothing fancy here. However we see that actual IO happens really late, around 12:51:22.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis">
</p>
<p>Socket IO actual Redis read / write</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not sure of the cause, we can definitely rule out Redis, the is either in the network, during
connection establishment, or actually during classloading.</p>
<p>In order to remediate that, we noticed this code is called once the application is ready.
So in order to avoid the contention the code was changed to pre-connect to redis during the
application startup before the the application is considedred ready. And it worked, this
specific issue disappeared.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-2-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 2 thread lanes">
</p>
</div>
<p>However as knew from the first recording, and now the second iteration this was not the only issue
identified when flying over the yellow and red events.</p>

<p>All the stacktraces above have one thing in common, a contention on a lock.
As thread were blocked, and new request appeared, this had the effects of increase the
queuing, and made tomcat creates new <em>http nio</em> worked threads until the maximum is reached
(200 by default). I applied the same trick: i.e before readyness, exercise code paths that
are lazy initialized. And it worked too. Most contention disappeared afterward.</p>

</p>
<p>Better startup / C2 compiler event</p>
</div>
<p>There was still some potential gain however. We noticed a few C2 compiler events,
If you don’t know C1 and C2, it’s the compilers that transform bytecode to assembly.
While C1 is somewhat superficial in optimizing the assembly, but it requires few
CPU and it allows code to be executed asap yet not as efficient as possible. In a
second phase C2 may kick in, this one outputs highly optimized code for hot code path
(code that is executed very, very often), but it requires resources.</p>
<p>Note this compilation event is not blocking threads !</p>
<p>As an experiment I decided to use the Graal compiler, which I believe is the new
generation of compiler. <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/compiler/README.md">Graal compiler</a>
is part of the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal">GraalVM</a> project.
It ships as an experimental option : <code>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler</code>.</p>
<p>And the result for this work load in particular.</p>

<p>This graph is falling under the <a href="https://latencytipoftheday.blogspot.com/2014/06/latencytipoftheday-most-page-loads.html"><em>percentlie</em></a>
but the improvement is still visible.</p>
<p>Now when we analyzed the new profile we noticed that JVM was using a lot of time to
revoke bias locking. Note the events in fushia are custom JFR events that track HTTP requests.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling">Gunnar Morling</a> has an inspiring
<a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">write up</a> about it).</p>
<p>This VM operation is done during safepoint during which the JVM is paused. At this time a lot of
of bias revocation event appears, so we removed them, and it works too.</p>

<p>The graphic below shows the difference in startup time. Other consuming backend services had to timeout
and eventually perform retries during rollouts which increased the pressure on the application.</p>

<p>Other smaller issues could be discovered and tackled, for example I noticed a few gaps
200ms wide at 30/1min intervals that were related to GC pauses.</p>

<p>For this application the GC is working within 20ms excepts for a few larger pauses

<p>Tuning GC is out of scope for this article, but JMC presents a nice view that could help identify GC
causes. In my opinion it’s currently a bit less powerful as GC logs because GC events lack
useful information only found in GC logs with appropriate tags and level.</p>

<p>Anyway from there we could imagine a <em>setting</em> file in the JDK dedicated for GC events.
Instead of parsing log files whose <em>string format</em> that may change a bit over releases
(even with unified logging) GC events could be analyzed leveraging the included JFR schema.</p>
<p>Also with JFR, it’s even possible to record memory leak using the <code>profile</code> <em>settings</em> file,
I never tried that in a real situation though, but if this avoids the need to make a heap dump
and parse it then I’m all in.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><strong>Empowering People. Uniting Communities.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://qbix.com/communities">Qbix</a> works with communities to release their own local <em><strong>social network</strong></em>, and help gradually onboard all the administrators, members, and guests. This lets people connect over common interests, date, make reservations at local establishments, get group discounts with local merchants, and so on. Meanwhile, the community could get statistical reports on how people are socializing.</p>
<p><a href="http://intercoin.org/">Intercoin</a> was launched in 2017 with the same vision – work with communities to release their own local <em><strong>payment network</strong></em>, and help gradually onboard all the merchants, citizens, and visitors. This would let people pay local merchants, receive a Basic Income, finance community projects, and support the local economy. Meanwhile, the community would get statistical reports on how money is flowing.</p>
<p><strong>Roadmap for Rolling Out Voluntary UBI</strong></p>
<p>There is a series of steps a community can take, to gradually implement a local UBI, one which is both voluntary and sustainable, and supports the local economy. This can be done by a town, a university, or even an online community.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Issue their own currency.</strong> The protocol powering this currency <a href="https://intercoin.org/invest.pdf">must be able to scale</a> to handle unlimited everyday transactions between people, even as money velocity goes up. Ideally, it should have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">no bottlenecks</a>, like mining a block. Let citizens and visitors obtain this currency by depositing cash with local ATMs, banks and currency exchangers which will load it onto their digital wallets and payment cards via QR codes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Get merchants to accept it.</strong> Tell local merchants about a new town currency that they will be able to cash out for 90 cents on the dollar through the town’s exchanges/gateways. People will be showing up with this currency, ready to buy things. Merchants who are ready to accept this currency will get to put a sign in the window and get more business.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Sell the currency at a discount.</strong> Let locals and visitors obtain the local currency at a 5% discount, to give them an incentive to obtain it. The local currency’s value <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-application-stablecoins">will be stable and pegged to the federal fiat currency</a>, or <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-application-virtual-currency">to a cryptocurrency like ITR or BTC</a> if your national currency is experiencing hyperinflation. Your town takes $100 and sells 105 local credits, which merchants must accept as payment for $105 of goods and may cash out for $94.50 .</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Circulating the currency.</strong> Since local currency holders would take a 10% hit every time they cash out the local currency, everyone will be motivated to push others to accept this currency. (In economics, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s law</a>.) Merchants will be motivated to hire and keep local employees who accept some or all of their salary in the town’s local currency. These employees may get a 5% raise, or simply beat out employees who refuse to accept the local currency.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Voluntary UBI Fund.</strong> The previous steps have built up more organic demand for the currency, and caused it to circulate within the community rather than being cashed out. Now, the town’s residents can begin to receive a Basic Income, from having more money being minted into circulation, and distributed to every recipient automatically. A fund is set up by the town, or the university’s donors, to act as reserves for cashing out merchants and others.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Taxes and Fees</strong> The town can now implement transaction fees, and taxes, which remove local currency from the economy, and thus reduce their liabilities and the amount of reserves they need to keep. By operating the payment infrastructure, the town can collect 1-2% on each transaction, and also begin to collect another 5% in sales tax. Here, “collect” actually means “take out of circulation”, to <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp244.pdf">counteract the money printing on the other side</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/16/18251646/modern-monetary-theory-new-moment-explained">Modern Monetary Theory</a> views the role of taxes as removing money from a fiat economy. Already in 1984, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grace_Commission#Report">the Grace commission report</a> found this was the case for nearly all income tax in the USA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>For “sound money” that people can trust, most banks keep fractional reserves, but communities launching their own currencies are going to start out keeping <em>full reserves</em> to redeem every coin issued, exactly in the manner promised, even though this might be overkill in practice.</p>
<p>Already in steps 2 and 3, the town had to only keep 90% or 94.5% reserves, respectively. Since there is a lag between a coin being issued, being spent at a merchant, and being cashed out, they have to keep even less reserves.</p>
<p>This 10% “exit tariff” continuously motivates all coin-holders to spend it locally rather than take a loss cashing it out. Thus, the coins increasingly circulate in the local economy, supporting local commerce, but also increasing the lag of an average coin being cashed out, sometimes by 10x or more. As a result, the community can begin to keep fractional reserves, which can become smaller and smaller as as less and less coins are cashed out at any given time.</p>
<p>Finally, as taxes and fees are introduced in the local economy, the community can start to issue a Universal Basic Income in its own currency, without causing inflation.</p>
<p>Various taxes can be organically introduced, including sales taxes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#:~:text=Georgism%2C%20also%20called%20geoism%20and,to%20all%20members%20of%20society.">land taxes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax">pigovian taxes</a> on things like pollution, fossil fuels, meat or cigarettes. By <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/">redistributing taxed money equally to everyone</a>, this can align public incentives with taxing these negative externalities, and avoid them falling disproportionately on the working class, as happened with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement">yellow vest protests</a> in France.</p>
<p>As demand for the local currency (and thus local real estate and services) grows, so does the town’s ability to tax various transactions. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/in-defense-of-blockchain-voting">The town’s citizens could be given the ability to democratically vote</a> on the level of taxes, and thus the level of UBI, they want to receive.</p>
<p>Thus the town can have both sound money and true democratic control of its fiscal and monetary policies, all the while becoming more self-sufficient and stronger. Any town will be able to introduce a local UBI to end food insecurity, improve health outcomes, reduce dependence on means-tested welfare programs, and so on.</p>

<p>Author: Andrea Di Dio</p>

<p>If you have any further questions or suggestions after reading this writeup feel free to contact me at a.didio@student.vu.nl or on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/hammertux" title="hammertux">@hammertux</a>). I will try to answer any questions or adopt any suggestions :)</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Seeing as the Slab allocator is a fairly hard and advanced topic to grasp but also essential to start programming in the Linux kernel, I wrote this document which explains how it works. I will briefly explain what the buddy allocator is in order to make it clear why a slab allocator is handy in the linux kernel and then continue with a more detailed explanation of the slab allocator(s). This writeup has been written based on the 5.3.13 Linux kernel (latest stable release at the time of writing — <em>Fri 15 Nov 22:13:17 CET 2019</em>). I will illustrate what happens on x86-64 systems in which the page sizes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normal Pages: 4KB (defined as the PAGE_SIZE constant in the kernel).</li>
  <li>Huge Pages: 2MB or 1GB.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-buddy-allocator">The Buddy Allocator</h2>

<p>The basic idea of a buddy allocator is fairly simple. Physical memory is broken up into large chunks of memory where each chunk is a <em>“page order”</em> (i.e., 2^n * PAGE_SIZE). Whenever a block of memory needs to be allocated and the size of it is not available, one big chunk is halved continuously, until a chunk of the correct size is found. At this point, of the two halves, also known as <strong>buddies</strong>, one will be used to satisfy the allocation request, and the other will remain free. At a later stage, if and when that memory is free’d, the two buddies (if both free) will coalesce forming a larger chunk of free memory.</p>

<p><em>Note: Linux uses a buddy allocator for each memory zone. You are not necessarily expected to understand the notion of a memory zone. Generally speaking there will be DMA and DMA32 zones, highmem zone and a Normal zone and other zones (e.g., Zone Movable).</em></p>

<p>The buddy allocator keeps track of free areas via an array of “queues” of type <code>struct free_area</code> which keeps track of the free chunks (in reality we are talking about page frames –&gt; <code>struct page</code>). It goes from 0 (min order) to 10 (MAX_ORDER - 1).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>free_area</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>struct</span> <span>list_head</span> <span>free_list</span><span>[</span><span>MIGRATE_TYPES</span><span>];</span>
		<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>nr_free</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the buddy allocator (and the slab allocator) allocate physically contiguous memory blocks. The third allocator in the Linux kernel, vmalloc() (which won’t be discussed for the time being) on the other hand, allocates memory that is ONLY virtually contiguous but not necessarily physical. It is primarily used for very large allocations, and cannot be used in cases where virtual addressing is not possible (e.g., devices)</p>

<p><img src="https://hammertux.github.io/img/buddy.png" alt="buddy" title="Buddy Allocator"></p>

<p>Page frames are allocated and free’d in the kernel using the following procedures:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// "linux/gfp.h"</span>
<span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>struct</span> <span>page</span> <span>*</span><span>alloc_pages</span><span>(</span><span>gfp_t</span> <span>gfp_mask</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>order</span><span>);</span>

<span>/*
 * e.g., to request one page: struct page *page = alloc_pages(GFP_KERNEL, 0);
 */</span>

<span>// "linux/page_alloc.c"</span>
<span>void</span> <span>free_pages</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>order</span><span>);</span>


</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both functions take the order as the parameter to see which queue to look for. If the queue is empty, the buddy allocator will search for queues in the bigger “orders” to split a block into two buddies and allocate the requested pages.</p>

<p>The GFP (Get Free Page) mask that is in the <code>alloc_pages</code> signature represents a set of flags that can be combined to represent who requests the memory allocation: e.g., <code>GFP_KERNEL</code> is used when allocating page frames for use in the kernel, <code>GFP_USER</code> is for userspace allocations, etc… (For a complete list of the GFP flags, see <code>include/linux/gfp.h</code>).</p>

<p>As it might be clear by now, the buddy allocator has one big problem. Say we want to allocate 33 pages. Seen as the buddy allocator works with the order queues explained above, the minimum amount of pages we can get is 2^6 = 64 because 33 &gt; 2^5 (=32). This <em>“wastes”</em> 31 pages (i.e., for an allocation of 33 pages, we would have an overhead of 31/64 * 100 = 48\%). This is also known as <strong>internal fragmentation</strong>. This problem in Linux is addressed using the <strong>slab allocator</strong> which slices pages into smaller blocks of memory (slabs) for allocation.</p>

<p><em>Note that in reality, the linux kernel maintainers have optimised the buddy allocator by defining page mobility (i.e., <strong>some</strong> pages are reclaimable or movable) which reduces the overhead discussed above, however this is outside the scope of this writeup</em> (if interested see the definition of <code>enum migratetype</code> in “linux/mmzone.h”).</p>

<h2 id="the-slab-allocator">The Slab Allocator</h2>

<p>The slab allocator in Linux sits on top of the buddy allocator and the basic idea behind it is to keep caches of commonly used objects available for allocation in the kernel. This is particularly useful because the Linux kernel allocates and frees many structures continuously (for example, the <code>struct task_struct</code> which is the structure that represents a process, <code>inodes</code>, <code>dentries</code>, etc…). By caching the freed object, it is possible for the basic structure to be preserved between uses thus allowing for quick allocation of new copies of the same structures. I.e., By reusing the freed objects, in some cases, the kernel doesn’t necessarily have to reinitialise them from scratch. Over the years (and many kernel versions…) the Linux slab allocator has evolved, and changed substantially. There have been three different implementations to this day:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>SLOB Allocator</strong>: Was the original slab allocator as implemented in <em>Solaris OS</em>. Now used for embedded systems where memory is scarce, performs well when allocating very small chunks of memory. Based on the <em>first-fit</em> allocation algorithm.</li>
  <li><strong>SLAB Allocator</strong>: An improvement over the SLOB allocator, aims to be very <em>“cache-friendly”</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>SLUB Allocator</strong>: Has better execution time than the SLAB allocator by reducing the number of queues/chains used.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nowadays (on most distributions) the default Slab allocator is the SLUB allocator.</p>

<p><em>Note: The generic “Slab Allocator” term can be used to refer to all three alllocators. Whenever there is the need to make a clear distinction between the allocators, I will write SLOB, SLAB or SLUB in capital letters.</em></p>

<p>A slab cache contains multiple slabs which in turn, contain multiple objects. The general organisational overview can be seen below:</p>

<p><img src="https://hammertux.github.io/img/slab-org.png" alt="slab org" title="Slab organisation"></p>

<h3 id="caches"><strong>Caches</strong></h3>

<p>The slab allocator provides two main classes of caches:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: These are caches that are created in the kernel for commonly used objects (e.g., <code>mm_struct</code>, <code>vm_area_struct</code>, etc…). Structures allocated in this cache are initialised and when they are freed, they remain initialised so that the next allocation will be faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Generic</strong> (<em>size-N</em> and <em>size-N(DMA)</em>): These are general purpose caches, which in most cases are of sizes corresponding to powers of two.</li>
</ol>

<p>This separation can be seen in the dedicated file for slab in the proc file system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo cat</span> /proc/slabinfo <span>#I will only show partial output for brevity</span>

<span># name &lt;active_objs&gt; &lt;num_objs&gt; &lt;objsize&gt; &lt;objperslab&gt; &lt;pagesperslab&gt; : tunables &lt;limit&gt; &lt;batchcount&gt; &lt;sharedfactor&gt;</span>

<p>The first few lines show dedicated caches, from <code>dma-kmalloc-256</code> onwards the generic caches are listed.</p>

<p><code>kmalloc</code> is the interface the kernel provides to do generic allocations through the slab allocator:</p>

The consequences of our testing the limits of our natural habitat are playing out today, poised to speed up and multiply.</p><p>The impacts of a warming world, today, are accelerating, compounding, and exacerbating.&nbsp;</p><p>Season after season, the societal toll of climate change is precipitated by climate-related natural disasters. The frequency and variability of these events are outstripping our ability to mitigate its source -- greenhouse gas emissions -- and our ability to adapt to the heightened risk.</p><h4><strong>Accounting for the Damage</strong></h4><p>Climate change is here, now. Natural disasters around the world <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-disasters/forest-fire-insurance-costs-soar-idUKKCN1P2129"><span>caused</span></a> $160 billion in economic damages in 2018. Devastating storms in the Gulf of the U.S. or the coast of Japan have led to lives lost and economic destruction of <a href="http://www.cityam.com/271984/natural-catastrophes-led-more-than-half-trillion-pounds"><span>upward of</span></a> $650 billion over two years. Global human displacement is seeing new highs in the Asia Pacific region, with <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/factbox-asia-pacific-worlds-most-disaster-prone-region">60 million people displaced</a> from 2013 and 2015 alone. This is an area where nearly a billion people are <a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/2015_Year%20in%20Review_final_PDF_1.pdf"><span>expected</span></a> to live by 2030.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595759604616_6108"><div><h4><strong>Fuel to the Fire</strong></h4><p>The U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/603440/"><span>called</span></a> climate change a “threat multiplier.” There are no countries immune to its effects. No clearer was this exemplified than during the Syrian Civil War in 2011. A series of droughts in the region <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629816301822"><span>led to</span></a> large scale migration of young men to the country’s cities. The socio-economic stresses already present were exacerbated by the influx. Less rainfall and prolonged drought in East Africa causing further entrenched conflicts over natural resources is also representative of how anthropogenic climate change is fueling the fire of conflict.</p><p>A study by the Pentagon last year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/in-dire-report-pentagon-warns-bases-imperiled-by-climate-change"><span>warned</span></a> of the link between climate change, war, and migration -- confirming that global temperature rise has and will fuel conflict and refugees. A few months later, Rod Schoonover, a member of the White House National Security Council, spoke to the Senate in June 2019, and explained:</p><p>“No country will be immune to the effect of climate change over the next 20 years, but some will be able to cope, adapt, or respond more effectively than others. […] Local problems could spillover with global consequences, such as through increased human displacement, natural resource disputes, commodity price volatility” […] “Climate change effects could undermine important international systems on which the U.S. and its partners are critically dependent, such as trade routes, food and energy supplies, the global economy, and domestic stability abroad.”</p><h4><strong>Risks to Come</strong></h4><p>There are also other risks that have only begun to be accounted for. Those that are often unforeseen but inescapable in an interconnected world.</p><p>For one, the management of corporate supply chains in an accelerating transition to renewable energy and disruptive changes to consumer habits will lead to economic collisions. It is not only the impact of destabilizing production sources in geographies vulnerable to physical climate disruptions. The prices of goods will also need to be stabilized in the open market as the financial industry, like pension funds, shift capital to ESG-pegged investments.</p><p>As an example, Coca Cola saw its balance sheets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/science/earth/threat-to-bottom-line-spurs-action-on-climate.html?ref=business"><span>endangered by droughts</span></a> that reduced water availability needed to produce its soda, a risk they recognize will magnify. Nike has also sounded the alarm in its supply chain management due to the increase of tropical storms hitting its factories that mostly reside in Southeast Asia. Four Nike factories in Thailand had to shut down in 2008 due to floods.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595762628047_9013"><div><h4><strong>Canary in the Coal Mine</strong></h4><p>The thawing of permafrost and retreating sea ice in the Arctic has been said to be the “canary in the coal mine” of the climate crisis. That’s because the gradual and dramatic physical changes to this area of the Northern Hemisphere are more immediate and detrimental as temperature increase here <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/syr/">happens twice as fast</a> as everywhere else.</p><p>The cryosphere&nbsp; -- the frozen water part of the Earth system -- is the first place we expect to see impacts of climate change. Sea ice in the Arctic follows a seasonal cycle with minimums in September and maximums in February and March. Ice sheets’ equilibrium of snow during the winter and melt during the summer is tipping. What happens next is a change in glacier length affecting ecosystems and water resources and a change in global sea level (i.e., the volume of ocean water and volume of the ocean basins).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595761665845_7869"><div><p>The Paris Agreement of 2015 asked that countries limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, with the aim of keeping the temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most devastating consequences of climate change.</p><p>Collective action is indispensable if we are to adequately rein in emissions to meet those targets. Understanding the interconnectedness and fragility of our natural and economic systems should prompt a sense of responsibility. Understanding the climate crisis, and our direct experience with it is a way to break through its absence and minimization in the national discourse. It should prompt us to vote, fund, and work on the solutions.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>This is the 2nd of the blog posts series that talks about ARM64 performance investigation for .NET 5. You can read my previous blog at <a href="https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-07-04-Dotnet-Arm64-Performance">Part 1 - ARM64 performance of .Net Core</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, I will describe the implication of weakly-ordered memory model of ARM64 on generated code by .NET and how we got good wins in ARM64 for some methods present in <code>System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary</code>.</p>

<h3 id="memory-ordering">Memory ordering</h3>

<p>ARM architecture has weakly ordered memory model. The processor can re-order the memory access instructions to improve the performance of the processor. It can rearrange the instructions to reduce the time processor takes to access memory. The order in which user has written the code is not guaranteed to be executed in same order and can be weakly defined depending on the memory access cost for given code. This is fine for single core machine but imagine a situation in a multi-threaded program ran on multi-core machine where core A is about to read a memory that just got overwritten by core B. The user might have intended to have code that is executed by core A to read memory before the code executed by core B writes. As you can see, this can easily get complicated and problematic. Luckily, in such situations, there are instructions to tell processors not to re-arrange memory access at a given point inside code. The technical term for such instructions that restricts this re-arrangement is called “memory barriers”. The <code>dmb</code> instruction in ARM64 acts as a barrier prohibiting the processors from moving the instructions across the fence. There are various types of barriers depending on if the user intent to restrict the re-ordering of just memory loads or memory stores or both. There are instructions to also have a barrier one-way i.e. instructions can be moved from after the barrier to before the barrier but not other way round or vice-versa. More details can be read in <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0024/a/memory-ordering">ARM documentation</a> or some of the excellent articles <a href="https://preshing.com/20120930/weak-vs-strong-memory-models/">here</a> and <a href="https://afana.me/archive/2015/07/10/memory-barriers-in-dot-net.aspx/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c-memory-barrier-using-volatile">C# memory barrier using volatile</h3>

<p>There are various ways to express the desire in C# to add  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier">memory barriers</a>. One such way is by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/volatile">volatile variable</a> in C#. With <code>volatile</code> variable, it is guaranteed that the runtime, JIT or the processor will not rearrange reads and writes to memory locations for performance. To make this happen, RyuJIT would emit <code>dmb</code> (data memory barrier) instruction for ARM64 every time there is an access (read/write) to a <code>volatile</code> variable.</p>

<p>For example, below is the C# code taken from <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/performance/blob/master/src/benchmarks/micro/libraries/System.Threading/Perf.Volatile.cs#L17">microbenchmarks</a>. It does a volatile read of local field <code>_location</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Perf_Volatile</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>double</span> <span>_location</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>[</span><span>Benchmark</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>Read_double</span><span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Volatile</span><span>.</span><span>Read</span><span>(</span><span>ref</span> <span>_location</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The generated relevant machine code of <code>Read_double</code> for ARM64 is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>; Assembly listing for method Program:Read_double():double:this
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for generic ARM64 CPU - Windows

G_M49790_IG02:
        91002000          add     x0, x0, #8
        FD400000          ldr     d0, [x0]
        D50339BF          dmb     ishld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code first gets the address of <code>_location</code> field, loads the value in <code>d0</code> register and then execute <code>dmb ishld</code> that acts as a data memory barrier.</p>

<p>Although this guarantees the memory ordering, there is a cost for it. The processor must now guarantee that all the data access done before the memory barrier is visible to all the cores after the barrier instruction. This means that the barrier requires all memory operations to complete before letting the cores cross the barrier instruction and this is time consuming.</p>

<h3 id="systemcollectionconcurrentconcurrentdictionary">System.Collection.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary</h3>

<p>While going through the benchmarks that are slower on ARM64, I noticed that <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/performance/blob/master/src/benchmarks/micro/libraries/System.Collections/Concurrent/Count.cs#L37">a simple benchmark</a> that gets the count of number of items stored inside <code>System.Collection.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary</code> was slower. On inspecting <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0f834db1fd80cf82e5ef27f72c48af1c911775da/src/libraries/System.Collections.Concurrent/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentDictionary.cs#L1005">GetCountInternal</a>, I noticed that there was an access of <code>volatile</code> variable <code>_tables</code> inside a loop. 
Here is the code before it was fixed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Tables</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// ..</span>
    <span>internal</span> <span>volatile</span> <span>int</span><span>[]</span> <span>_countPerLock</span><span>;</span> <span>// The number of elements guarded by each lock.</span>
    <span>// ..</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>private</span> <span>volatile</span> <span>Tables</span> <span>_tables</span><span>;</span>

<span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>GetCountInternal</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Compute the count, we allow overflow</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>_tables</span><span>.</span><span>_countPerLock</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>_tables</span><span>.</span><span>_countPerLock</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For this method, we generated ARM64 code having memory barrier instruction inside a loop. Here is the generated assembly code:</p>

<p><img src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/memory-barrier/code-before.png" alt="ARM64 code"></p>

<p>Here, <code>IG03</code> is a loop and the 4 yellow highlighted ones inside this block are the memory barrier instructions. Each pair is present to access two <code>volatile</code> variables <code>_tables</code> and <code>_tables._countPerLock</code>. Accessing <code>volatile</code> variable in a loop is sensible because different thread can update the value present in the variable, and we want to ensure that this doesn’t happen while we are calculating the count. However the code already takes <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0f834db1fd80cf82e5ef27f72c48af1c911775da/src/libraries/System.Collections.Concurrent/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentDictionary.cs#L974">appropriate locks</a> before executing the <code>GetCountInternal()</code> method. That means, the <code>GetCountInternal()</code> method is guaranteed to execute by one thread at a time. With that being present, it is fine to cache the <code>volatile</code> variable value out of loop and use it inside the loop. That will change the C# code to something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>GetCountInternal</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span><span>[]</span> <span>countPerLocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>_tables</span><span>.</span><span>_countPerLock</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Compute the count, we allow overflow</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>countPerLocks</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>countPerLocks</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the generated ARM64 code after the change.</p>

<p><img src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/memory-barrier/code-after.png" alt="ARM64 code"></p>

<p>If you see there are no more memory barrier instructions inside the loop <code>IG03</code> now. This simple change gave approxiametely <b>30%</b> win in the corresponding benchmark. The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/34225">fix to hoist volatile variable access out of loop</a> was merged. In it, I was able to also hoist the access for some other methods <code>CopyTo</code>, <code>GetKeys</code> and <code>GetValues</code>. I am pretty sure there are other places in .NET code base where similar code is there and someday, I need to sit and scan through it to get more performance wins.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>To summarize, C# developer should pay careful attention while using various locking APIs or language features such as <code>volatile</code>. They come with a cost and different architecture have different cost. Thorough code review and questioning the code you write is the key to write efficient code for cross-architecture.</p>

<p>Namaste!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today’s story is about how I hackily patched a <em>division-by-zero</em> bug in the game <em>Brogue</em> by using a few useful tools available on MacOS.</p>

<p>I’m a sucker for well-made roguelikes. I cut my teeth on the venerable <em>NetHack</em>, had a long affair with the very 
focused <em>Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and have flitted around with fresh takes on the genre like <em>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>My latest roguelike obsession has been <em>Brogue</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10816808/88485793-4d4c7600-cf3e-11ea-8c56-3599c806763a.png" alt="Screenshot of Brogue"></p>

<p>Brogue, whose development began in 2009, is fairly well renowned and influential for its 
<a href="https://www.tigsource.com/2012/01/15/brogue/">very streamlined game design</a> and 
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/01/23/have-you-played-brogue/">accessible UI</a>. 
You may have even been exposed to Brogue’s core mechanical conceits through <em>Pixel Dungeon</em>,the oft-forked and remixed mobile app, such as I was.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>While procrastinating working on performance reviews, I had been playing some Brogue. 
Picking up a magic Rapier of Confusion in the game, a quick weapon with powerful lunges, I enchanted it heavily with magic scrolls.</p>

<p>Stepping onto a new level, I enhanced it one more time with a Scroll of Enchantment. 
I then went to stab a lonesome goblin, when my game suddenly crashed. I shrugged, as this is not too uncommon. 
Reloading the game again from my auto-save and appearing at the start of the level, I enchanted the rapier once again and tried to stab the goblin. 
Again, the game crashed.</p>

<p>Usually the game crashes for very inexplicable reasons, but this was a repeatable issue. 
I reloaded the game, enchanted the weapon, and then tried to look at the weapon’s stats. 
The game crashed.</p>

<p>This time instead of hand waving away the MacOS crashed program prompt, I clicked on the report issue button. 
Thanks to Brogue being open-source, the program was compiled with debug symbols, 
so I could see by the stack trace that crash was being caused by a 
division-by-zero error by the fp_sqrt function called by the function runicWeaponChance. 
By searching for <em>runicWeaponChance</em> in the repo, 
I quickly found the line at fault <a href="https://github.com/tsadok/brogue/blob/master/src/brogue/PowerTables.c#L418">here</a>,
where the game adjust the proc change of magical effects for quick weapons, such as the rapier.</p>

<p>At first, I tried to do things the proper way. 
I downloaded the code from the official site and tried to compile it with Xcode. 
As many know, simply compiling code can often turn into a fun exercise in yak shaving. 
Apple appears to like to deprecate things very quickly with my version of Xcode 
refusing to touch the old Swift code that Brogue uses for its Mac UI. My heart pines 
for Windows more humane treatment of elderly code, as 
opposed to MacOS’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan%27s_Run_(film)">Logan’s Run-esque</a> regime.</p>

<p>I could have kept banging my head against Xcode, but it seemed like so much effort to change one 
line of code. At that point, I made my decision: even though there was probably a much better way 
of fixing this bug, I was just going to patch it out by hand.</p>

<p>This was a nice exercise to explore the state of reverse engineering on MacOS, albeit with a non-obfuscated, source available, symbol lush binary.</p>

<p>I first took a stab at the binary with <a href="https://www.hopperapp.com/">Hopper Diassembler</a>. 
The free-trial is fairly restrictive, but the labeling provided was very useful in 
hunting down the assembly code section corresponding to the buggy line of code.</p>

<p>I then used <em>otool</em> to get a text disassembly dump via the command <code>otool -vtj Brogue &gt; asmdump</code>.
<em>otool</em> is a nifty CLI program for working with LLVM produced code and artifacts that I believe is on MacOS by default.
I’m a little more dextrous interacting with code via Vim, so it was easier to play around with the 
specific assembly sections. Additionally, this tool gave me the full hexdump of each line of assembly, 
which I couldn’t easily tease out of Hopper.</p>

<p>Via a combination of Hopper and otool, I anchored on that call to <code>fp_sqrt</code>, represented by <code>callq 0x1000209f0</code> 
in the <code>otool</code> dump. Scanning up, I found the telltale <code>cmpq</code> then <code>je</code> that usually represents a branch in x86-64 assembly.</p>

<p>I struggled a bit finding ways of reversing the otool dump back into code, especially since I wanted to play 
with Brogue, instead of playing around with getting the correct linked header files. Thus, I fell back on trusty xxd.</p>

<p>I dumped the binary to a structured hexdump with <code>xxd Brogue &gt; hexdump</code>.
<code>xxd</code> is a very simple, fairly standard Unix program for creating readable hexdumps of binaries. 
I found particularly unique hexcode in the neighborhood of that branch in the otool dump <code>e8 7811</code> and jumped to it with the fun regex <code>e8.\?78.\?11</code> 
since I didn’t know how it would be split in the hexdump. I then found the branch leading to the code in the hexdump.</p>

<p>Looking back at the code and noticing that it was just a slight clamp on how powerful this Rapier of Confusion would be. 
I decided to short circuit the code. I changed the <code>JE</code> (jump if the previous cmp check was equal) to <code>JNO</code> (jump if not overflow). 
This jump was now was now always taken, skipping over the buggy proc chance code. 
To perform this change, I changed <code>0F 84</code> to <code>0F 81</code>. I then reversed the hexdump with <code>xxd -r hexdump &gt; Brogue</code>.</p>

<p>I loaded back up the game. Sadly, the game handles saves via replay, which now diverged given that the proc chance was higher. 
Someone actually smart probably could have patched it to actually fix the bug and avoid the desync issue. 
Instead, I just grabbed the seed for that run and quickly played back to the autosave.</p>

<p>And there was no more crashing. I got back to the goblin and killed it. 
Soon after that, I had an unfortunate run-in with some eels and was likewise killed.</p>

<p>I went back to working on my performance review, having learned a few more tricks for 
hacking binaries on MacOS and a greater fear and respect for eels.</p>

        <p><em>(This post was originally written as a reply on the mailop mailing-list, but
a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</em></p>
<p><em>Context: someone with a mail-server hosted in a German facility with a
poor reputation for handling abuse reports was asking for help on
sending email to their Gmail-using friends; they had SPF and didn't see
the point of DKIM; they had TLS setup for their mail-server, using a
certificate from CACert.</em></p>
<p>There's a PDF from Google from 2006 which is still worth reading:
<a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf">https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf</a>, entitled
“Sender Reputation in a Large Webmail Service” by Bradley Taylor.
Anyone running a mail-server today needs to read that document.</p>
<p>If you don't send much email, then the only IP-based reputation which
Google can assess you on is the reputation of your address-block, so
being in a “troublesome” hosting provider will score heavily against
you.  At that point, if not moving away, you need to try to balance out
that negative score with enough positives that any of the large
providers using reputation scoring will accept the mail.</p>
<p>Working forward-and-reverse paired DNS is even more important for IPv6
than for IPv4; for better or worse, some of the large providers have
decided that exemptions in old standards for old behavior should not
apply when folks deploy standards which are far newer.  So you
absolutely need an <code>MX</code> record, you must not just rely upon
address-records (<code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>).</p>
<p>With a poor IP-based reputation, you need to see if you can score a
better domain-based reputation.  This is where DKIM comes into play:
once you can provably link a message to really be from a given domain,
then even if you don't send much mail you can benefit from stuff like
“not on day-old-bread domain-lists”.  But having DKIM and then a DMARC
record does help (and <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2014/04/dmarc-stance/">I'm no fan of DMARC</a>).</p>
<p>For the mail-server's TLS: for that to count in your favor instead of
being a wash, I strongly suspect that it needs to be a certificate which
senders can verify.  For those people scoring up for “better TLS”, those
senders using DANE will be happy with a TLSA record in DNSSEC for your
CACert anchor.  But the large webmail providers are Resistant to having
to deploy DNSSEC verification, so instead have pushed out an alternative
called MTA-STS.  With MTA-STS, you're tied into “whichever subset of CAs
all the large senders you care about will trust”, and then using that CA
for the certificates both for the MTA-STS web-server and for your
mail-server.  Note that you don't need to implement the client logic for
MTA-STS (and I think it's antithetical to an open federated platform)
but do need to just publish the static information for those senders who
do use it. At that point, CACert is not going to cut it.  You'd need to
try Let's Encrypt instead.</p>
<p>The ongoing natural tendency from larger providers is to favor
supporting what the majority of their users want the majority of the
time.  With so many people using larger providers, they naturally tilt
towards stuff which works with the larger senders, and requiring more
hoops.  Those additional hoops create more work for smaller providers
and self-hosters doing thing manually.</p>
<p>We need better automation tools around all of this.  The below will make
it clearer why.</p>
<p>So, here is my current understanding of the best current practices here,
in reality not IETF idealism.  This includes making mandatory stuff
which some folks insist must be optional, because realistically to send
to some large providers it's not optional.  This list includes features
to make you compatible with ongoing trends in the EU (particularly
Germany) to strongly disfavor allowing clear-text SMTP.</p>
<p>This assumes that you are <em>not</em> a large sender who should also be
setting up feedback loops, learning how to “warm” IPs, considering BIMI,
postmaster tooling domain verification, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deliverability-fixes">Deliverability fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>reverse DNS with matching forward DNS; the name used should not
pattern-match anything generic and ideally would include a DNS label
of <code>mail</code> or <code>mx</code> or the like in it.</li>
<li>MX record, always.</li>
<li>Accurate SPF;
<ul>
<li>ideally not too broad; pay attention to SPF's query limits.</li>
<li>avoid <code>-all</code> at the end because, with the sole exception of “this
domain never sends email” records, the larger operators have metrics to
show that using <code>-all</code> <em>tends</em> to be a sign of over-enthusiasm rather
than reality, so it will slightly count against you;</li>
<li>remember to have an SPF record for your <code>HELO</code> hostname, because
when you send a “bounce” rejection, this is the thing which will be
looked up (since there's no domain in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DKIM set up, with thought towards the selector namespace.
<ul>
<li>RSA2048 key is effectively a hard-requirement
<ul>
<li>DNS TXT records consist of one or more DNS strings, each of which
is limited to 255 ASCII characters.  For a key of this size, you
will end up needing two DNS strings in the zonefile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed25519 keys are not yet widely supported, but by now are not
likely to actively break and make things worse for you, if you
dual-sign.  This needs to be a different selector.</li>
<li>Note that for various good reasons you should design this to be
something you routinely rotate.
<ul>
<li>Some folks use yearly, some monthly</li>
<li>I rotate every three months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DMARC record; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489" title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)">RFC 7489</a>
<ul>
<li>But for domains which humans send from <em>don't</em> use
<code>p=quarantine</code> or <code>p=reject</code>;</li>
<li>Do consider setting up a receiver for reports, just so that you can
see how much of a privacy breach DMARC reporting is when you send
to mailing-lists which don't re-sign. :-/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS certificate from a CA in the main trust anchor bundles;
<ul>
<li>Just use Let's Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MTA-STS web-server with HTTPS certificate from the same CA, and the
relevant MTA-STS txt file in place; add the DNS record when it's up
and happy.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" title="SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)">RFC 8461</a>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/">https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/</a> for a testing validation tool
(with thanks to Luis Muñoz for the pointer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the independent mail providers using the stuff broadly supported
in open source MTAs, you should look at DNSSEC, because the patterns
here are less susceptible to rent-seeking pressures:
<ul>
<li>DNSSEC-signed zone for your own domain
<ul>
<li>Use whichever signing algorithm CloudFlare are currently using:
this should be both current for cryptography and widely enough
supported that if it's not supported by someone's resolver, then
they have bigger problems than just your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNSSEC validating resolver for you to look up records of others
(consider <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> or <a href="https://www.knot-resolver.cz/">Knot Resolver</a>)</li>
<li>DANE records for your own domain (TLSA records in DNS)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7672" title="SMTP Security via Opportunistic DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS)">RFC 7672</a> for the SMTP details.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA">RFC 6698</a> for the base spec with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7218" title="Adding Acronyms to Simplify Conversations about DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">RFC 7218</a> for some common
acronyms which make talking about it easier.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7671" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Protocol: Updates and Operational Guidance">RFC 7671</a> for the updates and operational guidance.</li>
<li>There are other RFCs, for SRV records and for OpenPGP, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell your mail-server to obey DANE stuff, so that if there's a TLSA
record in DNSSEC-verified DNS then the mail-server can disable
fallback to cleartext for delivery to MX (and ideally also then
verify the TLS connection has a cert chain which is anchored in one
of the TLSA records)</li>
<li><a href="https://dnsviz.net/">https://dnsviz.net</a> is your friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>_smtp._tls</code> record so you can get reports of TLS failures sending to
you</li>
<li>Seeing if you can get your IP onto one of the open DNS-based
allow-lists (also called “whitelists” but some folks are moving away
from that term), such as <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/">https://www.dnswl.org/</a> or Spamhaus's SWL.</li>
<li>Periodically check if you appear in any DNS-based deny-lists.</li>
<li>Make sure you're not sending from “ISP residential address-space”; if
need be route your mail outbound via a host in better address-space
(and update SPF etc to match)</li>
<li>Don't do sender call-out verification to SMTP servers which aren't
yours.</li>
<li>For your own sanity, do make sure you set up <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>, or something
like it, scanning your mail-server logs, because SMTP AUTH online
cracking is widespread.  If they ever get in, your deliverability
will be negatively impacted by their spam campaign through your
mail-server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convenience-stuff">Convenience Stuff</h3>
<p>Outside of “Phil's BCP” above, additional non-deliverability but
convenience options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS SRV records for submission(s)/imap(s)/pop3(s)/sieve, even if just
to say with «<code>0 0 0 .</code>» that it's not supported.</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using OpenPGP with email,
then set up WKD to publish OpenPGP keys for your domain too.
<ul>
<li>This is just a fixed schema for laying out keys for HTTPS retrieval.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/?include_text=1" title="OpenPGP Web Key Directory">WKD draft</a> for details.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control">https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control</a> as a
management framework for an organization; the
<code>other/standalone-update-website</code> script is designed to be
embeddable into an existing site-building workflow without anything
else from the repository.</li>
<li>The GnuPG project has tooling available which manages the WKD layout as
an email-integrated workflow, for people to update their own keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using S/MIME then set up
SMIMEA records in your DNSSEC-signed DNS.
<ul>
<li>They look a lot like TLSA records; both are trust anchors in DNS.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8162" title="Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names for S/MIME">RFC 8162</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The moment you start specifying “must be TLS-secured” it's worth
adding <code>CAA</code> records into DNS, so that Certificate Authorities which
are broadly trusted will refuse to issue for your domain unless you
list them.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659" title="DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record">RFC 8659</a> for details</li>
<li>The values checked by each Certificate Authority as indicating they
have permission are required to be listed in their Certification
Practice Statement, as part of the CA/Browser forum's Baseline
Requirements.  If it's missing, then browsers are not supposed to
be trusting that CA.</li>
<li>For domain-validation CAs such as Let's Encrypt, consider adding
account information to those records to tie it to your specific
account.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8657" title="Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding">RFC 8657</a> for details.</li>
<li>Beware that at time of writing, Let's Encrypt only honors the
<code>accounturi</code> restriction in their staging environment, not their
production setup; this will likely change.</li>
<li>Remember that DNS zonefiles support comments.  You'll want them</li></ul></li></ol></article></main></div></div>

    <p><span>04 May 2020 · 2 min read</span></p><!-- https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/add-twitter-share-button -->
    <p>This article is based on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-syMunNy8">PyCon 2020 talk</a> of the same title.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html">In the beginning, was the command line</a>. Well, not quite the command line we know today.</p>
<p>We had typewriters. We were communicating using Morse code. One fine day, someone had an idea to connect a typewriter to an existing network of communication wires. And the teletypewriter was born!</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/tty-ww2.jpg">
</p>

<p>Teletypes removed the need for a human to know Morse code, which improved message typing speed and delivery time. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-eFFd5BmpU">1932 video</a>, the narrator describes how a teletype takes only a matter of seconds to deliver a message from London to Edinburgh. A stark contrast to the earlier ETA of one week — the time taken by a mail coach to undertake the same 600 km journey.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/mainframes.jpg">
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, computers were becoming powerful enough to interact with users in real-time. Another fine day, someone had an idea to repurpose a teletype, connect it to a modem, and use it as a remote interface to early computers. This was the origin of the command-line interface!</p>
<p>Among these teletypes were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friden_Flexowriter">Friden Flexowriter</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">Teletype Model 33</a>. Users typed commands after a prompt character was printed on paper. After they were satisfied with the input, they would press Enter which would then send the command to the computer. And finally the output from the computer would be printed on paper again.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/vt100.jpg">
</p>

<p>Teletypes were continued to be used as terminals to computers, until video displays came into the picture during the late 1970s. Video terminals quickly became popular input-output devices for computers after the manufacturers moved to a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Early_VDUs">common standards</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://vinayak.io/files/tty-modern.png">
</p>

<p>Today, physical teletypes and video terminals are obsolete. We instead have terminal emulators, which are <a href="http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/">software simulations of the real thing</a>. But, have modern terminal emulators borrowed any features from the OG metal beasts?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
										
<p>The guerrilla 3D-gun file development group <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Deterrence Dispensed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/team/det_disp" target="_blank">Deterrence Dispensed</a> released to the public yesterday the much-anticipated FGC-9 project. The FGC-9 is described in the official release documentation as “the most effective and easiest to build homemade semi-automatic firearm design for people with limited access to gunsmithing knowledge and tools.”</p>



<p>The FGC-9 release is important because it represents a fulfillment of the promise of 3D printed guns: they can’t be stopped. In 2013, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Liberator (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun)" target="_blank">Liberator</a> was proof of concept. In 2020, the FGC-9 is proof of carbine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FGC-9 enables everyday people all around the world to build a 9mm semi-automatic firearm, from start to finish, using a 3D printer and commonly available, unregulated materials. It’s specifically designed to be accessible to folks with minimal gun building experience, and avoids using parts commonly or easily restricted by law in the US and Europe. Anyone can build it, and no one can stop it.</p>



<p>In case there was any doubt about the political ideology here, you should know that the ‘FGC’ in the ‘FGC-9’ stands for “fuck gun control”. </p>



<p>Designer <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="jstark1809 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/jstark1809" target="_blank">JStark1809</a> details his motivation for the project, “Frustrated by not being able to acquire and bear firearms because of regulations and tyrannical laws, I embarked on the journey to learn to produce my own firearms.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>An anonymous European designer and maker, JStark1809 worked with other prominent developers to complete the project. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="IvanTheTroll (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/ivanthetroll" target="_blank">IvanTheTroll</a> developed the printed Glock magazines and ECM barrel making process, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Incarbonite (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/Incarbonite" target="_blank">Incarbonite</a> adapted an airsoft M4 fire control group for an AR-15 lower receiver. Others like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CtrlPew (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keybase.io/ctrlpew" target="_blank">CtrlPew</a> helped video documentation, and a team of beta testers put the build through its paces before release.</p>



<p>To fully appreciate the importance of this release, one must understand two things: </p>



<ol><li><strong>What Makes the FGC-9 Special</strong></li><li><strong>How 3D Printed Guns Got to This Point</strong></li></ol>



<hr>



<h2>What Makes the FGC-9 Special?</h2>



<p>Thanks largely in part to the efforts of the Deterrence Dispensed group, 3D printed gun developers in recent years have produced a number of functional, high-quality firearms that many nay-sayers thought to be outside the scope of what 3D printed materials could safely produce. Guns like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Glock 17 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.enblocpress.com/resources/the-3d-printed-glock-facts-vs-misconceptions/" target="_blank">Glock 17</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Tec-9 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8KaG1wIaPH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">Tec-9</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AK-47 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/Ivan_Is_Back/status/1244644782992961536?s=20" target="_blank">AK-47</a>, or even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hi-Point (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.enblocpress.com/news/deterrence-dispensed-project-lopoint-release/" target="_blank">Hi-Point</a>, can be anonymously fabricated at home without government oversight using a cheap 3D printer and factory/OEM parts. And they have a serviceable lifespan of thousands of rounds.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: you still need a factory barrel and parts kit for these guns. The Glock 17 print needs a parts kit and a Glock slide. The Tec-9 needs an upper receiver and parts kit. The AK-47 needs an AMD-65 parts kit. The Hi-Point needs a C9 or C380 parts kit. And these parts kits can be scarce or potentially even regulated by the government. </p>



<p>Currently, most 3D printed guns are <em>really</em> just 3D printed frames, that are later completed using factory parts. Factory parts that can’t practically or easily be made at home.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8MxL3alvtr/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div><figcaption>The purple frame is printed. The metal portion is factory produced.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The above video shows a Tec-9 build at the range. The frame (the purple part) is 3D printed, and the upper (the silver part) is from a factory-produced Tec-9. This is how the majority of current 3D guns are made. There’s no serial number, and no documentation the firearm exists. This is why it’s a ‘ghost gun’. But the construction of the gun is dependent on the availability (and, if you’re a good little boy or girl, the legality) of factory parts in order to come to life as a functional firearm.</p>



<p>The FGC-9 is important because it removes this limitation. The FGC-9 is made almost entirely out of home-built or 3D printed parts and unregulated materials. It can’t be regulated away, and it can be built by anyone. Keep in mind that the main designer is in Europe — where practically no firearms are legal, and items like barrels or frames (which are generally unregulated in the United States) are legally restricted and not readily available in the consumer market — and so the limitations to what could be used in the design process were greater than what’s faced by U.S. based makers.</p>



<h3>A Look at the FGC-9</h3>



<p>The FGC-9 release file package includes all the knowledge and design files necessary to print and make the gun. It also includes a detailed 110-page build guide, thoughtfully designed to walk the everyday person through the construction and assembly of the firearm.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The FGC-9 by Deterrence Dispensed and jstark1809" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Po7sX-rKuQs?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>The FGC-9 being fired</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote><p>The FGC-9 is a 9x19mm pistol caliber carbine that is made mostly out of 3D-printed components, utilizes an AR-15 or airsoft M4 rifle fire control group, is compatible with Glock magazines and offers a truly effective, simple to build and reliable tactical option for self-defense and more.&nbsp;</p><cite>– FGC-9 Documentation</cite></blockquote>



<p>The build files are seeded using the LBRY protocol over a peer-to-peer, distributed network using blockchain. Anyone who downloads the files can share them with anyone else. They can be stored on a USB thumb drive and shared offline or stored. There’s no centralized server or set of mirrors to be taken down via court order. Any efforts to mitigate the propagation of these gun files is purely for show at this point. The signal can’t be stopped.</p>



<p>The FGC-9 documentation offers clear, step-by-step instructions. There are plenty of diagrams, pictures, and schematics. There’s a table of contents. A troubleshooting guide. An email address. There’s an encrypted chat group — almost 7,000 people strong — where people can ask questions and find support. There are guides to 3D printing guns distributed widely across the internet (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="and even one hosted right here on En Bloc Press (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.enblocpress.com/resources/deterrence-dispensed-getting-your-first-3d-printer-and-how-to-use-it/" target="_blank">and even one hosted right here on En Bloc Press</a>).</p>



<p>All told, the FGC-9 release file equips the average person with the tools necessary to produce a quality 9mm semi-auto for less money than most factory-produced 9mm pistol carbines. No government paperwork, no bureaucracy, no permits (after all, free men don’t ask permission). The information is distributed globally and permanently. The only thing required to obtain the gun is the human effort it takes to build it, and access to a printer and common hand tools.</p>







<h3>What About the Barrel?</h3>



<p>The barrel is a rifled metal barrel, made through a process called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="electrochemical machining (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_machining" target="_blank">electrochemical machining</a>. “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Ivan_Is_Back" target="_blank">Ivan the Troll</a>” developed the easy to replicate ECM rifling process for 9mm barrels, which allows them to be built in small indoor spaces like an apartment or a bathroom. The ECM process lets the average person create a rifled barrel from metal, at home using salt water and electrodes, without requiring expensive machine tools or metal working experience. </p>



<h3>Which Magazines Does It Take?</h3>



<p>The FGC-9 runs on Glock 9mm magazines. These are readily available in most markets. For people who live in non-free states and countries, the magazines can be 3D printed and produced at home using the ‘Menendez Mag’ (named in honor of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bob Menendez (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.menendez.senate.gov/" target="_blank">Bob Menendez</a>, the anti-gun Senator from New Jersey). These magazines were also developed by Ivan, and the design files for the Menendez Mag are available from Deterrence Dispensed or from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="DEFCAD repository (opens in a new tab)" href="https://defcad.com/library/8ab6bdbc-d81f-4bdd-bf6f-89d97e18629f/" target="_blank">DEFCAD repository</a>. </p>



<hr>



<h2>How 3d Printed Guns Got to This Point</h2>



<h3>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h3>



<p>The release of the FGC-9 is especially significant because it represents a complete technological iteration of Cody Wilson’s Liberator pistol. If the Liberator is the first fish squirming out of the sea and onto dry land, the FGC-9 is the first human to stand upright. </p>



<p>The Liberator is a 3D printed, single shot handgun. It rocked the firearm and political world in 2013, when Wilson, and his company Defense Distributed, made the design files available to anyone with an internet connection. The pistol was essentially a minimum viable product, and was entirely impractical to use for self-defense or any other traditional application. But it drew plenty of attention, and it picked a Texas sized fight with the powers that be. </p>

<p>Liberator demonstrated to anyone with a gavel or a voting bloc that guns could be made at home, out of untraceable materials, by regular people. They weren’t practical yet — but it was obvious that eventually they would would be.</p>



<p>The response to Liberator by the government was sudden and severe. The files were ordered to be taken down from the internet. Wilson and his company have been involved in some legal battle or another almost perpetually since the release of the Liberator. The fight has involved years of effort, and involvement by the DOJ, State Department, and 21 separate state Attorneys General. But this fight is of Wilson’s design — and he’s winning.</p>



<h3>Fighting Within the Constraints of the System</h3>



<p>Cody Wilson, a former law student, has made clear that he believes the American legal system offers protections to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, and that his endeavors are not only legal but specifically protected. Computer code (and thus 3d printing files) are expressive; they’re free speech. The fact that this free speech can be turned into a gun is also protected. His fight is about principal, not necessarily practicality. He wants his efforts to be vindicated by the system. To be expressly permitted. To be beyond legal reproach.</p>



<p>The government obviously has a major interest in controlling the ability of citizens to possess firearms. 3D printing prevents this, and the government at the federal and state level has fought fiercely against it ever since Cody Wilson first fired the Liberator on YouTube.</p>



<p>Wilson has stated that he views his fight against the government as a struggle against “massive forces — anonymous forces — of discipline and control”, and that he sees liberty as “under siege”. </p>



<p>But Defense Distributed’s challenges in court are expensive and time consuming. Their success is never guaranteed, and their future is always threatened by the power of the State. The administrative state can use its powers of bureaucracy to bog down …</p></div></div>

        From: C. M. Sperberg-McQueen <cmsmcq@blackmesatech.com>
        Subject: Re Humanist 34.53

In Humanist 34.53, Norman Gray suggests, as have others in slightly
different formulations, that the committee which specified Algol 58
is likely to have been influenced in its choice of basic symbols by
the keyboards in use at the time:

     The language designers decided it would be useful to lexically
     distinguish assignment from an equality test, they presumably cast
     around in their memories for a suitable symbol available using the
     keyboards in front of them, which would have some level of
     intuitive affordance to the language's users, ':=' fitted the
     bill, and thus made they it so.

That this scenario appeals to many of us can be seen by the regularity
with which some variant of it appears in postings to this thread.

Unfortunately, it can easily be shown false by the account given in
the Algol 58 report itself and by the actual content of the report.
This has been pointed out several times over the last week, though for
reasons apparently connected to Humanist's consistently erratic mail
handlers none of the messages have appeared in Humanist.  With this mail
I would like to make one last attempt to outwit Humanistâ€™s
black hole for incoming mail and rehearse some of the relevant factual
background.

Some salient points:

- The Uniscope 300 keyboard pointed to by NG as a sample of what might
have inspired the Algol 58 committee, became available as a commercial
product about 1964 (as did the IBM 029 keypunch machine pointed to by
WMcC in the same role), about six years too late to have served as a
point of reference.

- The committee's report on the language says explicitly that the
choice of symbols was not guided by the availability of characters on
existing equipment:

    The characters [of the reference language] are determined by ease
    of mutual understanding and not by any computer limitations, coder
    notation, or pure mathematical notation.

- On the contrary, the reports on what we now know as Algol 58 and on
Algol 60 distinguish systematically among the reference language, the
publication language, and the language's 'hardware representations',
which are expected to vary across machines and countries.

- It is in the reference language that := appears as the signal for
assignment.  That the committee not only said that they had not
consulted current hardware limitations, but had really not done so, in
choosing the basic symbols of the reference language, seems to be
confirmed by the inclusion of a number of symbols not then (and not
now) readily available on keyboards:

   Ã— the St. Andrew's cross symbol for multiplication
   Ã· the dotted-fraction symbol for division (in addition to the solidus)
   â‰&nbsp; the negated equal sign
   â†‘ â†“ â†’ an up arrow, a down arrow, a right arrow
   [ ] square brackets
   â‰¤ â‰¥ the symbols for 'less than or equal to' and 'greater than or
equal to'
   â‹€ â‹� â‰¡ the symbols for logical conjunction, logical disjunction, and
logical equivalence.

If in 1958 any group casts around in their memories for symbols
available on contemporary keyboards and then chooses that particular
inventory of signs, one can only infer that their memories of having
seen actual keyboards were hazy at best.

- The fact that the reference language used symbols not readily
available on data entry equipment was a source of criticism of the
Algol 58 and Algol 60 reports, as is clear from Jean Sammet's paper on
the development of Cobol, which has been cited earlier in this thread
and from the first comment after John Backus's paper at the 1959
conference in Paris at which he first presented what is now known as
the Backus Naur Form for grammars, also cited earlier in the thread.

It may be noted that the designers of Cobol, who made a conscious
effort to define their language in terms of characters available on
widely used data entry equipment and who were working a little later
than the group that defined Algol 58, eschewed not only St. Andrew's
cross and the other symbols listed above, but also (unless I am
mistaken) provided textual alternatives to symbols like &lt;, &gt;, and =.


Like some others in the thread, NG stresses the arbitrary nature of
such symbols and their interpretation; I take this to be a gentle
remonstration with WMcC hinting that he is looking for meaning in
places where none is to be found.

It is true, I think, that the assignment of symbols in languages like
Algol 58 is arbitrary in the sense that it proceeds by fiat from the
will of the language specifiers.  If they had chosen to represent
assignment by St. Andrew's cross, multiplication by the solidus, and
addition and subtraction by a down arrow and the keyword 'begin',
respectively, they would have introduced no logical contradiction in
their work.

And yet, it seems unlikely that any of the thousands of programming
languages devised over the last seventy years have chosen to represent
assignment with St. Andrew's cross, or subtraction with the keyword
'begin'.  (I have just checked: not even Brainfuck does anything of
the kind, and Snobol4 limits itself to allowing the programmer to do
so.)  Why is that?  NG has already provided the answer: like others
who over the centuries have invented notations, the designers of
programming languages seek what NG calls "some level of intuitive
affordance" to users.  This was particularly important, it appears,
for the members of the group specifying Algol 58, since one of its
explicit goals was to serve human-to-human communication of algorithms
(hence the explicit identification of a "publication language"
suitable for typesetting and journal publication, which indeed duly
ensued: in the U.S. Algol had much more success as a language for
publishing algorithms than as a language for programming computers).

Willard's initial post, then, asks (it seems to me) the entirely
reasonable question "what was the intuitive affordance provided by the
choice of := to signal assignment, and why was := preferred over, say,
a left-pointing arrow?  or a right-pointing arrow with the variable
name on the right?"  I am not much persuaded by his conjectural
answer, but the question seems to me to be a reasonable one.

After all, the history of symbolic notations is full of symbols chosen
for their ability to suggest an appropriate idea, or avoided because
of the danger of conveying a misleading idea.  (Descartes was familiar
with the symbol = for equality, and used it in that sense in at least
one letter, but generally avoided it; Florian Cajori speculates that
he may have done so because the same symbol was also in use to denote
arithmetical difference.)

So far, the only suggestions in the discussion that have not involved
anachronistic keyboards (and anachronistic assumptions that senior
academics and technical people would in 1958 have been likely to know
their way around a keyboard or a keypunch machine) are Herbert
Wender's observation that := and =: are sometimes used in mathematical
definitions (with the definiendum on the same side as the colon) and
Norman Gray's suggestion that Church's lambda calculus might be a
possible source.  Alas, my copy of Church's Introduction to
mathematical logic does not show any use of := as a symbol; as a
substitution operator Church uses S with a subscript and a
superscript.

If Church's notation influenced the group, it may have been in a
negative sense. The German and Swiss participants in the meeting
proposed to write assignment in the form

   a + 3 â†’ s

but the American participants resisted and in Algol 58 this assignment
would take the form

   s := a + 3

It is clear from F.L. Bauer's account of this that twenty years later
he still resented the way this decision came out.  (I can relate to
that.)

Although he does not use := to denote substitution, Church does use a
special symbol to denote definitions.  And as luck would have it, he
uses the right arrow, pointing not at the definiendum but at the
definiens:  X â†’ Y means 'X is defined as meaning Y', not 'Y gets the
meaning X'.

It may be a stretch to invoke Church at all here: McCarthy was not a
participant at this stage (and in any case McCarthy at some point
confessed to not having read Church all the way through, which is
apparently how Lisp came to have dynamic scope instead of the lexical
scope of the lambda calculus).  But one can easily imagine a
discussion beginning "wait, surely you mean for that arrow to be
pointing the other way!" "no, why?!" and ending "why don't we find
another symbol to use here?"  And one can easily imagine that
discussion finding its echo in the preliminary report's bland
reference to "ease of mutual understanding".

All in all, I am sure that the arguments in ZÃ¼rich over the assignment
symbol were absolutely nothing compared to the arguments over the
decimal point.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9425"><div><div><div><h2>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney lambasts Apple and Google for their App store policies charging 30% commission from developers</h2><p>With the dates for <a href="https://androidrookies.com/jeff-bezos-tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-sunder-pichai-to-testify-in-u-s-antitrust-hearing-on-july-27/">House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearings</a> nearing, there has been a storm of criticism directed against Apple for its App store policies. Earlier we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/telegram-developer-wants-a-law-to-make-apple-allow-iphone-users-to-install-apps-from-other-app-stores/">Pavel Durov of Telegram</a> who wanted legislation enacted to make Apple allow iPhone to install independent Apps stores. Now, Epic Games CEO, Tim Sweeney has joined the crowd.</p><p>Sweeney castigated both Apple and Google for their monopolistic App store policies. Both Apple and Google charge a 30% commission from developers offering paid/premium or in-App services. Sweeney says that both the tech giants have<span> built app stores that are entirely based on the idea of monopoly.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Sweeney called Apple an <strong>absolute monopoly</strong>.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-crippled-app-store-with-30percent-cut.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, Sweeney says Apple has invented “an absolute monopoly,” while Google crushes competition stores with “UI barriers.” He says that the 30% fee charged by both Apple and Google are unrealistic and emphasized that these charges only&nbsp;increase the price of the apps and games.</p><p>Epic Games has a bad history with App stores, especially with Google Play Store. It had earlier Fortnite for Android smartphone as an APK to beat Google’s 30% commission fees. However, when Fortnite players complained that installing the APK was too complicated, Epic Games relented and published it on <a title="Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicgames.fortnite&amp;hl=en_IN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> paying Google the 30% commission as mandated.</p><p>“Google essentially intentionally stifles competing stores by having user interface barriers and obstruction. If every developer could accept their own payments and avoid the 30% tax by Apple and Google we could pass the savings along to all our consumers and players would get a better deal on items. And you’d have economic competition,” Sweeney told CNBC.</p><p>He was also very fierce on Apple. “Apple has locked down and crippled the ecosystem by inventing an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, on the monetization of software,” Sweeney told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin.</p><p>This is not the first time Sweeney has lashed out against Google. In <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/12/tim-sweeney-android-is-a-fake-open-system-and-ios-is-worse/">February 2020</a> during a keynote address to the DICE Summit game event in Las Vegas, he had called Google’s Android a “fake open system” for putting up barriers in front of users.</p><p>The representatives of tech giants, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, will be testifying in a <a href="https://androidrookies.com/jeff-bezos-tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-sunder-pichai-to-testify-in-u-s-antitrust-hearing-on-july-27/">Congress hearing</a> for their anti-trust behavior. <a href="https://androidrookies.com/microsoft-complains-about-apples-30-commission-from-app-developers-during-private-anti-trust-meeting/">Brad Smith, President and Legal Officer of Microsoft</a> has already had a private meeting with the anti-trust committee members in which he complained about Apple’s App store commission.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>If you try to deploy a new release of Clojure library with
<a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>, it prompts you to sign the .jar file with GPG. This step
often causes confusion and breaks. I believe that it’s not worth the effort to
make it work.</p>
<p>As far as I know, <em>nobody ever verifies the signatures</em> in a systematic way.
There are a bunch of obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s unclear if any tools for verifying the signatures actually work. For
example, I just tried to run <code>lein deps :verify</code> against a couple of projects
and it reported every dependency as <code>:unsigned</code>. I know that some of those
dependencies are signed and I verified that the <code>.asc</code> files exist on
repo.clojars.org.</li>
<li>It’s hard to find the public keys for the library maintainers. Sometimes they
upload them on the keyservers, sometimes not.</li>
<li>There’s no established way of communicating that which public keys should be
trusted. If there’s a new release and it has been made with a new key, your
best bet is to e-mail the maintainer and ask what is up.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to get any security benefits from the signatures in practice. Thus
it’s okay to set <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/998d373ae06d17234efffde761fae93242c736fa/sample.project.clj#L111"><code>:sign-releases</code></a> to <code>false</code> in your
project.clj even if Leiningen’s manual does not recommend it.</p>
<hr>
<p>In princple, the systematic checking of signatures could provide security
against a dangerous supply-chain attack: weak or leaked passwords for package
manager accounts. For example, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/the-year-long-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks-against-open-source-is-getting-worse/">several RubyGems</a> have been attacked
this way. Most likely the signing keys would not be compromised at the same
time.</p>
<p>There are alternative solutions, though, such as disallowing publishing packages
without multi-factor authentication. Using Clojars’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/GmAU4XwnRpw">deploy tokens</a>
helps a bit as well.</p>
<p>Right now we place a lot of trust on Clojars and Maven Central. If either of
them got compromised, we all would be screwed. Package signing could be a part
of a solution to mitigate that risk, but a comprehensive solution would be
something like using <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a>. Go’s <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-mirror-launch">checksum
database</a> is also worth taking look at.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re moved to do something about this, please do not build
anything new using PGP. To quote Latacora: <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP is bad and needs to go
away</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve written this post in part to be proven wrong. I’m eagerly waiting for posts
from y’all about how you do, in fact, systematically verify the signatures.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>As a kid I loved buying books during the yearly book fair in the city where I grew up. I was not a good judge of my aptitude so I mostly ended up buying books that were beyond me. Naturally a lot of them remained piled up in my home gathering dust. They still do. My mother had her own pile of literary collection. Too many books for a small house.</p><p>Once in a while somebody would mention about the unread books. It would be some distant uncle during his yearly visit, or one of my own friends. “How many of them have you read?”</p><p>It was a logical question. It made me wonder if I had been wasting my parents’ money buying all these books and leaving them unread.</p><p>Turns out I wasn’t the only one being asked this question. The late Italian writer <a href="https://amzn.to/3g33Unw">Umberto Eco</a> had a personal collection of thirty thousand books in his private library. Most of the people who visited him reacted with, “What a library you have! How many of these books have you read?” Only a very small minority understood that a library is not meant to show off the number of books one has read. A library is a research tool where read books are far less valuable than unread ones. In other words, the knowledge you have gained is less valuable than what you don’t know.</p><p>Does it mean that we should buy books only not to read them because reading would make them less valuable? Can this idea be used as an excuse to be a collector of books, but not a reader? Not exactly!</p><p>I’ll agree that this isn’t the most obvious and intuitive concept to grasp. On top of that, this can be easily misinterpreted. Yet this is precisely how Nassim Nicholas Taleb starts <a href="https://amzn.to/30PJCrg"><em>The Black Swan</em></a>—by introducing us to the concept of an <em>antilibrary</em>.</p><blockquote><em><em>“A private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”</em></em></blockquote><p>— Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <a href="https://amzn.to/30PJCrg"><em>The Black Swan</em></a></p><p>An antilibrary—the unread books in our collection—represents what we don’t know. It’s a reminder of our ignorance. It’s a delineation of the fact that even if we pursue knowledge for the next 100 years, we won’t be able to know everything there is to know. In fact, not even a tiny fraction of it.</p><p>The purpose is not to depress us, but to remind us to be humble about our own knowledge. So that we don’t become so cocksure about everything that it prevents us from learning, from seeing, and from questioning things. Especially our own conjectures.</p><p>When you have just started reading books, you are absolutely sure of your ignorance. Therefore you value the unread books. You have certain notions and assumptions that you want to verify. The problem starts when you’ve read a good deal. You start becoming too sure, too confident, too prudent. As Taleb writes, this is exactly what leads to Black Swan events.</p><blockquote><em><em>It is our knowledge—the things we are sure of—that makes the world go wrong and keeps us from seeing and learning.</em></em></blockquote><p>— Lincoln Steffens (1866 – 1936), Investigative Journalist</p><p>Our knowledge is incomplete, imperfect, and infinitesimal in absolute terms. The antilibrary represents the <em>unknowledge</em>—the things we don’t know. Unknowledge is the only antidote to our overconfidence from knowledge.</p><p>A scholar is someone who knows many things. An <em>antischolar</em> is somebody who is humbly aware that they don’t know everything. They are “someone who focuses on the unread books, and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device.” They question things. They are skeptical empiricists who know that what they don’t know is more valuable than what they know.</p><p>A good library is filled with mostly unread books. That’s the point. The unread books are a tool for us to question our knowledge, our assumptions, and our worldview. “You’ll never read all of them,” many people say when they look at my unread collection. With time I’ll go on adding more unread books, and my probability of reading all of them will further decrease. They are right. I won’t be able to read all of them, and that’s exactly how it works.</p><p>I’m aware of the limits of my knowledge. My library of unread books is a constant reminder. My limited knowledge can only take me so far. Like all of us, I know that unknowledge—what I don’t know—affects me far more than my knowledge. As Taleb writes, “Note that the Black Swan comes from our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises, those unread books, because we take what we know a little too seriously.”</p>

                    <p>As COVID-19 continues to alter the way we live, there is a scramble to predict what our “new normal” will look like. After the virus fades away or, God help us, becomes a constant in our day-to-day life for years to come, which change brought on by the pandemic will stick? </p><p>There is one consensus prediction that is emerging, especially among knowledge workers and those in tech: The distributed workforce is here to stay. And, furthermore, this change is a good thing for workers and welcomed by all.</p><p>To which I say: Um, have you ever worked remotely?</p><p>I have understood and enjoyed the perks of working remotely before. From 2009 to 2016 I wrote about entrepreneurs and creatives, many of whom were early proponents of remote work. And from 2017 to 2019, I worked remotely for a small, privately-owned e-learning company and then a 1000-employee SaaS company. </p><p>While the upsides to remote work are true, for many people remote work is a poison pill — one where you are given “control” in the name of productivity in exchange for some pretty nasty long-term effects.</p><p><strong>In reality, remote work makes you vulnerable to outsourcing, reduces your job to a metric, creates frustrating change-averse bureaucracies, and stifles your career growth.</strong> The lack of scrutiny our remote future faces is going to result in frustrated workers and ineffective companies.</p><p>Let’s tackle these issues one at a time. </p><h2 id="remote-work-democratizes-talent-for-everyone-even-you-">Remote work “democratizes talent” for everyone. Even you.</h2><p>In May 2020, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/manjunath-bhat/2020/05/03/remote-work-is-the-next-big-equalizer/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a Gartner blog post</a> summarized a common argument in favor of remote work: “Democratizing access to resources lowers the barriers to innovation and enables everybody to partake in the ensuing prosperity.” Not everyone can (or wants to) live in an urban commercial hub. Remote work, the thinking goes, allows people to live in whatever environment they’d like — depending on their own circumstances.</p><p>These remote technology jobs don’t just go to a version of you living on a cute farm in the Hudson Valley. Those jobs go to <em>anyone, anywhere.</em> </p><p>This is good for global prosperity and perhaps arguably inevitable. However, if you’re working in technology today as an American, you have tremendous earning potential. This earning potential may not be possible forever. It’s baffling to me that American workers would cheer an acceleration of this trend that would place downward pressure on their wages.</p><p>When you, the American worker, share this belief you are being blinded by an erroneous belief in American exceptionalism. When your company goes all-remote, it is starting a clock that ends in you eventually competing with the global talent market — especially if travel and visas continue to be restricted by the federal government.</p><p>A tech optimist will likely (and correctly) point out that more innovation and new technologies will replace any outsourced jobs. While my academic brain wants that to be true, I can’t help but see the devastating effects globalization had to our manufacturing workers and communities — many of which have never recovered or benefited from new innovations.</p><p>Innovation in the American economy didn’t get transferred one-to-one. Every manufacturing worker did not suddenly receive a tech job. Every technology worker outsourced will not receive the benefit of the next wave of innovation directly. </p><h2 id="remote-enables-you-to-be-forgotten">Remote enables you to be forgotten</h2><p>Remote work advocates often praise the focus that remote work enables. No longer will you be judged by the time you spend at the office, they say, you’ll instead be judged and rewarded on whether you “get things done.” </p><p>These “benefits” are always used to sell remote work to an imagined audience of Dilbert-like cubicle dwellers who are imprisoned and subjected by annoying coworkers and an oppressive boss. The key to freedom, they say, is to work remotely. Basecamp co-founder Jason Fried <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-fried/excerpt-remote-workers-boost-quality.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">writes in <em>Remote</em></a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Working%20From%20Home%20Boosts%20The%20Quality%20Of%20The%20Work" data-author="Jason Fried&nbsp;" cite="https://www.inc.com/jason-fried/excerpt-remote-workers-boost-quality.html">
                      <p>What you're left with is "what did this person actually do today?" Not "when did they get in?" or "how late did they stay?" Instead it's all about the work produced. So instead of asking a remote worker "what did you do today?" you can now just say, "Show me what you did today." As a manager, you can directly evaluate the work--the thing you're paying this person for--and ignore all the stuff that doesn't actually matter.</p>
                      
                      </blockquote>
                      <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>First, being more productive isn’t the only goal of working, but let’s put that to the side. Second, Fried is right, you do gain a bit of freedom from your boss (which doubles as a loss of a mentor, but we’ll get to that). You also gain “freedom” from your colleagues and collaborators. Which means you’re effectively on your own. </p><p>This is empowering to some, but the isolation can mean your contributions are easily overlooked or misunderstood. As a result, I’ve noticed a disturbing trend at (especially larger) remote companies: Some managers often have no clue what their direct reports are doing and how they are doing it. </p><p>Performance reviews are difficult enough under normal circumstances. But how do you judge someone when you can only see their output and never their process? Marketers, project managers, product managers, growth marketers, and others spend their days supporting or maintaining existing things. &nbsp;</p><p>This a difficult problem that predates any shift to remote work. But when applied to remote work, a manager loses several of the inputs needed to judge a direct report’s output — including, yes, who is physically (and mentally) present when actual work is being done. But also: Do the other team members appear to enjoy working with this person? And, if they are struggling, is it due to a lack of effort/focus or something outside of their control? </p><p>Employees who “do the right thing” spending extra time and energy supporting their teammates receive absolutely no recognition for doing the little things needed for a smooth-running, collaborative organization. It’s usually a quantifiable fact whether a sales departments reaches their goals. It’s not as clear that the social media manager had a good quarter.</p><p>With the removed context of a real-life office, your team’s output is difficult to individualize for your manager — especially if work is done in private DMs or one-on-one Zoom calls. The manager sees the end product with no visibility as to who did what, who pulled their weight, who made tough choices, and who made things more difficult. This has a nasty side effect of the leader viewing you less as a person who they have to empathize with and understand — and more as a talking head on a Zoom call or Slack who does things for them. </p><p>This will cause your work to “flatten.” Whatever soft skills you bring to the table will be minimized when working remotely. This will lead to companies and processes relying less on things like creativity and collaboration and more on simple inputs and outputs. Which, again, makes your work easier to outsource.</p><p>We bemoan the loss of empathy and context created by solely getting our news and interacting via social media … and we then turn around and set up our working lives in their image.</p><p>This has a pronounced effect in large organizations.</p><h2 id="remote-work-breaks-large-companies">Remote work breaks large companies</h2><p>Remote work supporters often return to the “interruption culture” at an IRL office as an argument for distributed work. First, clearly people that believe remote work creates an interruption-free zone have never used Slack or email. Second, those interruptions often exist for a reason: They often communicate information that ensures everyone is working on the right thing.</p><p>For companies that have strong product/market fit, have reached scale, and have a clear product roadmap, remote works swimmingly. A distraction-free environment means everyone can focus on “what matters” because “what matters” has been clear and consistent. &nbsp;</p><p>But what happens when “what matters” changes? </p><p>Because it will. Eventually, the market shifts. There’s a competitor or a Black Swan-style event in the industry (like, say, a global pandemic). Suddenly the well-oiled machine needs to adapt and change course. For companies larger than 100 people, this is tremendously difficult in an in-person environment. Working remote, it’s damn near impossible. Twice-a-year in-person meetups are not enough to disseminate brand new strategies. </p><p>And I'd bet that as formerly IRL companies go remote, it will have a negative effect on their ability to iterate and adjust to market conditions making them vulnerable for a smaller, co-located upstart.</p><h2 id="remote-work-can-stifle-your-career-growth">Remote work can stifle your career growth</h2><p>Think back to your first job in your current field. I’d bet there is a person or group of people who were tremendously important in shaping your career. They gave you candid advice and were able to passively observe and critique your behavior.</p><p>When you work remotely, mentorship is stifled because there is no learning via osmosis. You can’t model your behavior on your successful teammates because you only see them on Zoom and in Slack. Whatever process they are using to achieve their results is opaque to you. </p><p>Much of the language used around remote work (and remote events) assumes that one is in the mid-to-late stages of their career. When you’re young, you don’t need “focus” or to “get things done.” You need exposure to new ideas and people. You need the serendipitous fortune of sitting in on the right meeting, attending the right happy hour, or earning the respect of the right observer.</p><p>All of the above is more difficult in a remote environment. As a result, we are in danger of having a generation of new knowledge workers who are never properly onboarded and hastily told to work remotely with nothing but an OKR to chase. They have no context for how to do all of the messy office-ready skills like building consensus, having productive disagreements, and advocating for their ideas.</p><p>Additional…</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

    <h3><a id="porism-statement" href="#porism-statement">Poncelet's Porism</a></h3>
    <p>
    Poncelet's Porism is a well-known and much-beloved result in plane
    geometry, discovered by Jean-Victor Poncelet in 1813. Here is the
    statement:
    </p><p>
    <b>Theorem [Poncelet's Porism]</b>
    <i>
      Let $C$, $D$ be non-singular conics in general position in the projective plane,
      and $n \ge 3$ a natural number. If there exists an $n$-sided polygon,
      all of whose vertices lie on $C$ and all of whose edges are tangent to
      $D$, then there exists such a polygon with a vertex at any given point of
      $C$.
    </i>
    </p><p>
    If this is the first you have heard of Poncelet's Porism, pause for
    thought: it is not obvious.
    </p><p>
    Poncelet's Porism has a lot going for it. It turns out to be an
    archetypal result demonstrating the power of "modern" algebraic geometry,
    it admits numerous fruitful generalisations, and it has connections to many
    beautiful subjects including elliptic curves, modular forms, dynamical
    systems, the Painlevé equations, and even instantons.
    But there is another reason for its popularity: it
    asserts the existence of some very appealing pictures and animations.
    </p><h3><a id="interactive-app" href="#interactive-app">Create your own animated gif</a></h3>
    The animated gif at the top of this page was created using the app
    embedded just below. You can use it to make your own animated gif right now.
    <p>
    On the left hand side, the following two conics are plotted:
    $$
        \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1, \qquad x^2 + y^2 = 1,
    $$
    together with the results of Poncelet iteration (the red lines). There are
    controls for adjusting the values of $a$, $b$ and the number of edges,
    as well as other elements whose functions
    are hopefully self-explanatory. We defer an explanation of the curves on the
    right until we discuss
    <a href="#cayley-closure-condition">Cayley's results</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For anyone interested, the source for the above is available at Microsoft's
    code-hosting hub <a href="https://github.com/ocfnash/poncelet" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p><p>
    Note that an instance of the porism in this real plane has two natural
    topological invariants:
    </p><ol>
      <li>the vertex count, $n$,</li>
      <li>the number of times the polygon winds around the circle, $w$.</li>
    </ol>
    Note that $w &lt; n$ and that $w$, $n$ are coprime because the graph of
    the polygon is connected.
    These numbers will show up in different guises below.

    <h3><a id="gh-porism-proof" href="#gh-porism-proof">Griffiths and Harris proof</a></h3>
    Working over $\mathbb{C}$, let $C$, $D$ be non-singular conics in general
    position in $\mathbb{P}^2$ and define the incidence space:
    $$
      X = \{(p, l) \in C\times D^* ~|~ p \in l\},
    $$
    where $D^*$ is the set of lines tangent to $D$. Because there are
    two tangents to $D$ through a general point of $C$, $X$ carries a natural
    involution that swaps these tangents:
    $
      i_D : X \to X.
    $
    Similarly, because there are two points of $C$ lying on a general tangent
    to $D$, $X$ also carries a natural involution that swaps these points:
    $
      i_C : X \to X.
    $
    Note that $i_C$ has fixed points corresponding to the four points of
    $C^*\cap D^*$, and $i_D$ has fixed
    points corresponding to the four points of $C \cap D$.
    <p>
    Composing, we have an endomorphism:
    $$
      T = i_D \circ i_C : X \to X.
    $$
    Poncelet's Porism is the statement that $T^n$ has a fixed point iff it is
    the identity map.
    </p><p>
    With this setup, we need only chain together the following basic
    facts from general theory:
    </p><ol>
      <li>X is a smooth and has genus one (i.e., topologically a torus).</li>
      <li>After choosing a point to act as identity, every smooth
          curve of genus one becomes an elliptic curve, isomorphic to a quotient
          of $\mathbb{C}$ by a maximal-rank lattice.</li>
      <li>The only involutions admitting a fixed point on an elliptic curve are
          of the form $u \mapsto v - u$ for some point $v$. (Alternatively, note
          that for any $u \in X$, the fibre through $u$ of the natural map $X \to C$ is
          $u + i_D(u)$, and that this must be constant. Similarly for $i_C$.)</li>
    </ol>
    Applying fact 3 to $i_C$ and $i_D$ we learn that $T$ must be a translation
    and thus so also must $T^n$.
    We are now done: the only tanslation with a fixed point
    is the identity map.
    <p>
    Note that if $O\in X$ is the identity, this proof gives us a new
    interpretation of $n$: it is the order of the torsion point $T(O)$. We
    will depend upon this interpretation when discussing
    <a href="#cayley-closure-condition">Cayley's results</a> below.
    </p><p>
    If you didn't know the results 1–3 already, you might not be all
    that happy with this proof. The good news is, we will give another
    more elementary proof, due to Jacobi,
    <a href="#bjs-porism-proof">below</a>. In fact it's really the same proof
    in different language.

    </p><h3><a id="projective-invariance" href="#projective-invariance">Projective invariance</a></h3>
    Jacobi's marvellous proof of Poncelet's Porism is characteristic of its
    time and benefits from judicious choice of coordinates. In preparation, we comment
    on coordinate choices.
    <p>
    Poncelet's Porism concerns only incidence and tangency, and so
    is projectively invariant. Since the group of projective transformations of
    the plane is eight-dimensional, and the space of conics is five-dimensional,
    the space of pairs of conics up to projective equivalence is
    two-dimensional (5 + 5 - 8).
    </p><p>
    There are at least three natural ways to parameterise these two
    dimensions:
    </p><ol type="i">
      <li>A circle and a concentric, axis-aligned ellipse. This yields
          local coordinates such as the semi-minor, semi-major radii of the
          ellipse dividing by the radius of the circle.</li>
      <li>A pair of non-concentric circles. This yields local
          coordinates such as the radii of the two circles divided by the
          distance between their centres.</li>
      <li>The two cross ratios of the four intersection points of the conics:
          one cross ratio on each conic.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Following Schoenberg, we will present Jacobi's argument in terms
    of the parametrisation (i) even though Jacobi used (ii). Note
    that (i) exists as a consequence of the well-known result
    in linear algebra that for any pair of quadratic
    forms, we may always find a basis in which one is a diagonal matrix of
    $\pm 1$s, and the other is diagonal. We will discuss the case
    over $\mathbb{R}$ with $C$ and $D$ represented by the matrices:
    $$
      \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
        1/a^2 &amp; 0     &amp; 0\\
        0             &amp; 1/b^2   &amp; 0\\
        0             &amp; 0       &amp; -1/r^2
      \end{array}\right]
      \quad\mbox{and}\quad
      \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
        1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
        0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
      \end{array}\right]
      \quad\mbox{respectively.}\quad
    $$
    </p><p>
    These matrices are of course only defined up to scale which allows us to
    assume $r=1$. Note that even after this we have still not used all the
    symmetry of projective invariance: we have freedom to permute the elements
    of our basis. Thus the quotient by full projective invariance is naturally
    (an open set of) the weighted projective space
    $\mathbb{P}(1, 2, 3) \simeq \mathbb{P}^2/S_3$
    where the eigenvalues $1/a^2$, $1/b^2$, $-1/r^2$ are homogeneous coordinates
    on the $\mathbb{P}^2$.
    </p><p>
    Note that the same $S_3$ indeterminacy is
    also visible in parameterisation (iii). A cross ratio depends on the ordering
    of the four points; without an ordering we only have an orbit of the
    anharmonic group (abstractly $S_3$) rather that a single value. These
    cross ratios will naturally show up again below when we discuss the
    <a href="#pencil-branching">natural map</a> to the pencil of conics.
    </p><h3><a id="bjs-porism-proof" href="#bjs-porism-proof">Bertrand-Jacobi-Schoenberg proof</a></h3>
    We work over $\mathbb{R}$ and take our conics
    to be an ellipse and concentric circle:
    $$
        \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^2, \qquad x^2 + y^2 = 1.
    $$
    and for simplicity assume $0 &lt; r &lt; b \le a$. Following Schoenberg, the following diagram will be useful:
    <img src="http://olivernash.org/2018/07/08/poring-over-poncelet/assets/images/schoenberg-diagram.svg" width="500" height="500">
    We wish to study the map that sends the point $P$ to $Q$. The key is to
    work in terms of the natural angular coordinate of the
    circumcircle of the ellipse. More precisely, we associate points of
    the ellipse with their images under the map $(x, y) \mapsto (x, ay/b)$.
    This maps the points $P$, $Q$ on the ellipse to the $P'$, $Q'$ on the
    circumcircle, and likewise the tangency point $M$ to $M'$. Then define
    the angles:
    $$
      \phi_0 = \angle{AOP'},\quad \phi_1 = \angle AOQ'.
    $$
    We seek to understand $\phi_1$ as a function of $\phi_0$. This turns out to
    be easy. Firstly:
    $$
      \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_0} = \frac{M'Q'}{M'P'}.
    $$
    Exercise: prove this! Secondly, trivially:
    $$
      \frac{M'Q'}{M'P'} = \frac{MQ}{MP}
    $$
    (both sides are equal to the corresponding ratios of $x$
    coordinates.) Thirdly, by Pythagoras:
    $$
      \begin{align}
        MP &amp;= \sqrt{a^2/r^2 - 1}\cdot\sqrt{1 - m\sin^2\phi_0},\\
        MQ &amp;= \sqrt{a^2/r^2 - 1}\cdot\sqrt{1 - m\sin^2\phi_1}.\\
      \end{align}
    $$
    where $m \in [0, 1)$ is given by:
    $$
      m = \frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2 - r^2}.
    $$
    Combining these three facts, we obtain the key identity:
    $$
      \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_0} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - m\sin^2\phi_1}{1 - m\sin^2\phi_0}}.
    $$
    Equivalently, the function:
    $$
      \omega(\phi_0) = \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi_1}\limits\frac{d\psi}{\sqrt{1-m\sin^2\psi}}
    $$
    is constant.
    <p>
    Now suppose
    $\phi_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n$ is a sequence of angles associated with
    the Poncelet construction, and that the $\phi_i$ keep track of how many
    times we have wound round the circle by adding multiples of $2\pi$ if
    necessary. The $\phi_i$ correspond to a Poncelet $n$-gon iff:
    $$
      \phi_n = \phi_0 + 2\pi w,
    $$
    for some natural number $w$. Since the integrand is positive, this is true
    iff
    $$
      \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi_n}\limits\frac{d\psi}{\sqrt{1-m\sin^2\psi}} =
      \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi_0 + 2\pi …</p></div>

</p>
</address><p>Many foreigners travel to Switzerland to take their own lives with the assistance of an organisation. In Switzerland, assisted suicide is considered a legitimate way to end your life.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, This Jenny, a respected Swiss politician, ended his life with the help of the assisted-suicide organisation Exit. He was terminally ill with stomach cancer. Swiss television accompanied him in his last weeks in an unflinching examination of the subject of assisted suicide. There was no cry of outrage across the country. Instead, there was sympathy and admiration. Assisted suicide is broadly accepted by the Swiss population and the country is one of the most progressive in this matter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More and more people are considering assisted suicide and becoming members of assisted organisations like Exit.</p><p>“In Switzerland we know that this option is open to us if we need it,” says Samia Hurst-Majno, a professor of ethics at the University of Geneva. “Cases of assisted suicide remain rare, even in Switzerland. But many people are reassured to know that they have this option even if they never use it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of a local vote and surveys show that most Swiss don’t want to ban assisted suicide. Shortly after citizens of Zurich spoke out vehemently against restrictions on assisted suicide, the Swiss government decided against introducing nationwide regulations – even though the European Court of Human Rights has already chided Switzerland for a lack of legal clarity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hurst-Majno says one possible reason for this is that Swiss laws on assisted suicide have existed for a long time, and that the population trusts that abuses won’t take place.</p><p>“We are confident that people with mental illnesses will be sent to prevention services, that all other alternatives will be considered, and that assisted suicide is only open to people with a rational desire for suicide as the last resort,” the professor says.&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Switzerland, like many other countries, decriminalised suicide.</p><p>“If suicide is a crime, then suicide assistance is a crime of complicity,” Hurst-Majno explains. “If it is not a crime, then there is also no complicity.”&nbsp;</p><p>Following a broad public debate in Switzerland, there is consensus that self-interest should be a decisive point:</p><p>“Anyone who assists the suicide of someone who is financially dependent on them, or someone from whom they will inherit, should be penalised,” Hurst-Majno says. “But if there are no self-interested motives, then assistance is not a crime.”&nbsp;</p><p>In most countries, active suicide assistance is banned. Switzerland is one of very few countries where foreigners can opt for it. This has led to a form of “death tourism”. According to Dignitas, a well-known organisation that accepts non-Swiss applications, more than 90% of its members in 2018 were foreigners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acceptance of assisted suicide does not mean zero opposition. Cases involving applicants who do not suffer from terminal illness but are simply tired of life or have a mental condition sparked controversy even in Switzerland. Some doctors are not willing to issue prescriptions for a lethal drug in such cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Swiss assisted-suicide organisations are campaigning for more leeway. They want easier access to lethal medications for people without terminal illness or for those who are very old or weary of life. Some are even lobbying for the legalisation of assisted suicide in other countries through court cases, consulting, lobbying, advertising and public relations campaigns. &nbsp;</p><p>Their vision: assisted suicide should be legal worldwide so that nobody has to make the journey to Switzerland to die of their own free will.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>

<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a graduate of Michigan University who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>

This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594000429895_118575"><div><h2>The mystery of its location</h2><p>It’s often repeated how most of the cameras that landed on the moon stayed on the moon. Astronaut Gene Cernan had been telling the story of how<a href="https://petapixel.com/2012/12/06/the-last-man-to-walk-on-the-moon-left-his-camera-for-a-long-term-gear-test/" target="_blank"> he left his camera</a> on the lunar rover<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9728289/Apollo-17-commander-left-camera-on-moon-40-years-ago.html" target="_blank"> for years</a>, recounting the tale in interviews:</p><blockquote><p>"I left my Hasselblad camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith, the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass. So, going up the ladder, I never took a photo of my last footstep. How dumb! Wouldn’t it have been better to take the camera with me, get the shot, take the film pack off and then (for weight restrictions) throw the camera away?"</p></blockquote><p>It’s easy to accept Cernan at his word - he’s an American hero who flew to space three times, twice to the moon - so as far as everyone was concerned, including the press, the camera was right where he said he left it. Plus, a quick scan of the Apollo 17 stowage list reveals no mention of a lunar surface camera splashing down with the command module. So why the mystery? </p><p>Looking closer, there’s a sprinkling of evidence in photos and transcripts that suggest his camera did in fact return to earth, contradicting both the 1972 NASA inventory and the astronaut. No, don’t cue the dramatic music… there’s no mischief or intentional deception here. I believe Gene Cernan did leave a camera on the lunar rover, just not “his.”&nbsp;Memory can be a fickle thing, even for heroes, and that rings especially true in this case&nbsp;when the story involves not one camera, but three.</p><h2>A tale of three cameras</h2><p>When you’re going to the moon, you’re assigned a camera with a 60mm lens that gets strapped to your chest to document samples, experiments, and the lunar terrain. Both astronauts get their own, clearly labeled with a sticker on the side: “CDR” for commander and “LMP” for lunar module pilot, but they weren’t mutually exclusive, often being swapped throughout the mission based on what film they were shooting with. On Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt - LMP and geologist extraordinaire - was set up with the black &amp; white film. When he needed color, he’d grab Cernan’s camera and vice versa. </p><p>A third Hasselblad camera was also to be used on the mission; it was a bit of a beast really, boasting a 500mm telephoto lens meant to capture distant lunar features for, you know… science. Of the two astronauts, Cernan got stuck looking down the barrel of the 500mm the most, so it’s entirely possible that <em>this</em> is the camera he remembers leaving on the rover. In fact, the post-flight analysis of the transcript pretty much confirms it. But what happened with the other two?</p><h2>The stowage list says they stayed </h2><p>A little background. As each Apollo mission launched, NASA prepared a final stowage list that documented all the equipment aboard, detailing what was to be transferred between each spacecraft before and after landing on the moon. This list was then revised in real time as plans changed due to time or weight restrictions. In the latest revision of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17stowage.pdf" target="_blank">Apollo 17 LM Lunar Launch Stowage List</a>, dated December 12th, 1972, the three cameras that went down in the LM are all marked as “offloaded,” meaning they were left on the surface. The problem is, they launched from the moon on December 13th! So if extra items were brought onboard, it’s not recorded. At least not in what’s available online.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-aspect-ratio="55.70987654320988" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594649779919_85920"><div>

One update for the post-sleep procedure. I understand you brought in the LMP's camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a>&nbsp;before the final jettison here. And, by the way, you're Stay for that final jettison.</p><p>183:40:39&nbsp;<strong>Schmitt: </strong>Okay, Gordy. It's already in the jett bag, thank you. (Pause)</p><p><em>[</em><strong><em>Cernan </em></strong><em>- "Obviously, I did not leave the LMP's camera on the Rover pointed at the zenith. But I swear I put something there. It's possible it could have been the 500 lens, because we didn't bring it back and I mentioned it was under the seat. I know that I did something with a camera. Now, it could have been a lens. And I stuck it between the seats, sort of wedged it in somewhere, and pointed the lens toward the zenith."]</em></p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "Houston wanted us to jettison the camera because they didn't want us to take pictures of Ron Evans' EVA. They had decided it was too cumbersome and too risky. But, we were going to ignore them, and we figured out how we could do it. But we needed a camera. Ron had a camera, but it was not EVA-qualified."]</p><p>[<strong>Cernan</strong> - "We had made up our minds we were going to take pictures of Ron."]</p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "And we needed a lunar-surface camera to do it."]</p><p><strong>[Cernan - "Now, we did put the LMP's camera in the jett bag, so we must have had mine."]</strong></p></blockquote><p>*Click*. Finally, we have some clarity. One 500mm camera stays behind, and of the two that go up into the LM, the LMP camera gets jettisoned back to the surface before launch. Cernan’s camera leaves with them as they blasted off live on TV and in color.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594997167739_70248"><div>

July 26, 2020 | https://mindfulnessquest.com/how-to-train-your-subconscious-mind-to-think-positive/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mindfulnessquest.com/how-to-train-your-subconscious-mind-to-think-positive/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into the details of how to train your subconscious mind, let’s understand the importance of positive thinking and how does the subconscious mind work.</p> <p>There was a time in my life when I was trying hard to improve my financial situation. Despite being a qualified IT professional with more than 12 years of work experience, I was unable to find work for myself. So I decided to make it on my own and started freelancing for clients.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>But very soon, I found myself failing miserably to generate sustainable income, and as time progressed, I started becoming angry and frustrated. I started criticizing everything and everyone around me, my relationships suffered, and I started losing health.</p><p>Before I even realized I was grossly overweight, I was having lower back pains and bouts of migraine tension headaches (programmers know what I’m talking about).</p><p>Things were going from bad to worse for me. It took me some time to realize that I needed to clear this pool of negative energy, which I had built around me and be more accepting of what life has to offer me.</p><p>Most people tell themselves, “Oh, I’ll be happy once I achieve this or that,” and that’s the root cause of their misery in the first place.</p><p>You can manifest whatever you desire in life, and the universe will assist you, but you have to approach it with positivity. Positive thinking changes our outlook of life and fills us with compassion and love. Once I understood this, things started rolling for me.</p><h2>So what exactly is the subconscious mind?</h2><p>Most people believe that the human mind has dual nature, the conscious or the rational mind, and the subconscious mind. The conscious mind is aware and contains all thoughts, feelings, memories, desires, and is more logical.</p><p>A subconscious mind, on the other hand, is like a reservoir or a vast database that contains all types of thoughts, memories, feelings, and emotions.</p><p>Unlike the conscious mind, the subconscious mind lacks the discriminatory capability of what is good or bad. It believes whatever your conscious mind tells it. And that’s the reason why it is so powerful.</p><p>The only way to program the subconscious mind is through the conscious mind. So if you repeat positive affirmations such as, “I am a happy person, I will succeed in my endeavors, I will achieve financial freedom”, your subconscious mind will start believing it. Even in times of greatest adversities, you will stay strong and focused on your goals.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>On the other hand, if you repeat negative affirmations such as, “I don’t deserve success, I can’t afford that car, I’m bad at managing relationships”, the mind will start believing that and may drive you into depression, anxiety, and fear.</p><p><em>The subconscious mind
can be our best friend or our worst enemy. It can be whatever we want it to be.</em></p><p>The subconscious mind is reactive, and it reacts to the nature of your thoughts. Did you know that the subconscious mind makes up more than 90% of your mind, as opposed to the conscious mind?</p><p>How many times have you tried quitting smoking and failed? How many times did you try losing weight but ended up gaining instead? How many times did you start a project just to leave it midway or when you were just about to finish? Why does this happen to us? This happens because we have not programmed your subconscious mind properly.</p><p>Now that we understand how the subconscious mind works, let’s explore the various ways in which we can harness its power to be more productive and successful in life.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><h2>Mindfulness Meditation</h2><p>Meditation is one of the most powerful tools to train your subconscious mind. In meditation, we go deep inside ourselves and observer our thoughts and emotions. We simply become the witness without judging or being affected by the thoughts we generate.</p><p>If you want to get started with meditation, check out the free <a href="https://mindfulnessquest.com/meditation-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Meditation Guide</a>.</p><p>Meditation helps you to advance spiritually by making you calm inside, and psychologically more stable. By practicing it every day, you slowly learn to confront your fears and negative emotions and are no more affected by them.</p><p>Start by sitting in a comfortable posture. You can be seated on the ground in a cross-legged position, or if that’s uncomfortable, just sit on a chair with your spine erect. One of the simple techniques involves watching the breath as if it moves in and out of your body.</p><p>Start by doing this every day for just 10 minutes and gradually increase the time as you become more proficient in it.</p><h2>Positive Affirmations</h2><p>Earlier, we touched upon this briefly and saw how the conscious mind could be used as a tool to train your subconscious mind. If there were no consciousness or awareness, it would be impossible to train the subconscious mind and avail the infinite potential it offers.</p><p>One way is to use Affirmations. The main process here is to keep repeating a particular behavior over and over again until the message is deeply ingrained in your subconscious mind. For example, if you want to lose weight, keep telling yourself, “I’m not going to stop my workouts until I shed 10 pounds”.</p><p>One thing to note here is that you should not take up a challenge that far exceeds your present capacity. Otherwise, this will not work, and this is the main reason why people fail in their resolutions.</p><p>For example, don’t try to lose 20 pounds in 1 month is you are overweight. Be practical while making your affirmations, and choose a small target initially. Once you achieve your goal, increase the challenge.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the most common affirmations
people use to train their mind:</p><ol><li>I will think positive.</li><li>I will not judge others and be critical of them.</li><li>I will spread love and joy to others because I’m happy inside.</li><li>I am a spiritual being with infinite potential to love.</li><li>Each day I will make an effort to learn something new.</li><li>I will keep a smile on my face throughout the day, even if no one talks to me.</li><li>I will not let negative though pull me down.</li></ol><p>By repeating such affirmations, you tremendously boost your self-esteem, develop empathy towards others, tone down your ego, and increase your confidence.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>You must make an effort to believe in your affirmations (with emotions). If you don’t believe what you are saying, your subconscious mind will not get the message. Just like meditation, affirmations also require daily practice.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many other techniques which I will be covering shortly in other articles.</p><p>One of the most important books that helped me to learn about the subconscious mind is “The Power of Subconscious mind”. If you’re interested, you can check out this <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/301V3wS">book here on amazon</a>.</p><p>You can significantly increase your productivity by tapping the hidden powers of your subconscious mind. It just takes 30 to 40 minutes of your time daily, and the benefits are tremendous. Don’t take my word for it; just try it yourself and see.</p><p>Present times offer us unlimited opportunities, but the reason why we fail in our objectives is that we get distracted. Distractions are all around us in various forms.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>Our conscious mind has to deal with a lot of information at the same time. Through meditation, we get clarity as to what is useful and what is not, and positive affirmations allow us to transfer positive messages to our subconscious. Through repeated practice, we form habits that stick for life.</p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/" data-pin-do="buttonBookmark" data-pin-color="red" data-pin-height="128"><img src="https://mindfulnessquest.com/ezoimgfmt/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png" ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" data-ezsrc="//mindfulnessquest.com/ezoimgfmt/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png"></a></p></div></div>]]>

July 26, 2020 | https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><h2 id="scene">Scene</h2><p>It was a bright, Saturday morning, July 4, 2020. I had just gotten Max all situated with breakfast and cartoons (Mighty Mike, if you’re curious). Julie was sleeping in like she usually does on every day I have off. I’m an early riser and this is a cherished part of our co-parenting. It gives Max and I time to bond (when he’s not stuffing his face and laughing at cartoons). I sat down with my laptop to plow through the week’s personal email.</p><h3 id="the-e-mail">The e-mail</h3><p>“Oh look, the AWS bill, I should have a laugh at that,” I thought to myself. Until recently, it had been pennies a month for some very light SES usage. In February, I moved off Google Cloud back to AWS. The primary motivation was that Google had so intertwined GSuite and GCP IAM that it became overly confusing.</p><p>Along with that migration came the CDN for this web site (cdn.chrisshort.net). I mean <a href="https://chrisshort.net/low-cost-content-delivery-network-cdn/">a Cloudflare fronted S3 bucket that holds assets deemed too big for git</a> when I say CDN. It’s not even <a href="https://chrisshort.net/">chrisshort.net</a> itself, as it is hosted on Netlify’s CDN and every other static site I own or manage. I’ve been a Cloudflare user for a long time. The CDN is less than 300 files and has existed for over five years on various clouds. Moving it back to AWS from GCP bumped the AWS bill to an average of $23/month. Not too bad given the <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/suwvjwwc/chrisshort.net">site’s traffic</a>.</p><h3 id="the-shock">The shock</h3><p>Not on this Saturday morning, nope. June 2020’s AWS bill was a heart palpitation causing <strong>$2,657.68</strong> (<a href="https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/invoice498711077_redacted.jpg">JPG</a>). I audibly gasped, “Keep your shit together.” I thought to myself. Max was leaned up against me drinking his milk. I know he could tell something was wrong because he looked at the laptop screen. I only assume when he saw letters and numbers, he thought, “Adult stuff… These cartoons and this Cinnamon Toast Crunch tho.” 2020 being the year that it is and my military history being what it is, I’ve been diagnosed with a panic disorder (on top of the PTSD and physical injuries).</p><h3 id="the-panic">The panic</h3><blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Good morning, $2700 AWS bill!</p><p>Holy shit...</p></div>— Chris Short (@ChrisShort) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1279406322837082114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>I immediately began having a panic attack. As I took the mental steps to mitigate the onset of the panic attack, I started forming a battle plan. Yes, I can switch back to emergency mode, like back in the old days, when something would go bang or boom, and I’d run towards it (it’s not helpful overall, trust me).</p><p>First, Max: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs? Check.<br>Next, me: As if it was destined, my alert for morning medications went off.</p><p>“Daddy’s gotta grab his meds, bud.” Instinctively, Max leans off me (wow… okay… he’s used to hearing that reminder and statement shortly after that; my brain is now in overdrive). I take everything I need to conquer this while still being able to function cognitively. I refill my coffee and grab a laptop charger.</p><h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2><p>Check the source of truth.</p><p>What’s diverged?</p><p>How do we get things back to normal?</p><p>I login to the AWS console, hoping I got some output that was uniquely off this month. Weirder stuff has happened (like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">S3 going down</a>). This bill couldn’t be more out of the norm than ever. This AWS bill is several hundred dollars more than our mortgage! I hit the AWS Billing page and am deeply saddened by what I see:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1f2dd17bc5d8e1407c22b84f7f981a7ad9888eba/8e235/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-bill-landing-page.png" alt="AWS Billing landing page showing a $2,657.68 balance"></p><p>There it was. <strong>$2,657.68</strong>, staring at me. “This can’t be legit.” Drilling down even further, it looks like it is indeed legitimate traffic from the cdn.chrisshort.net S3 bucket in us-east-2. In total, <strong>more than 30.6 terabytes of traffic</strong> had moved out of that one S3 bucket. WHEN?!? Did this just happen? Nope.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3373f05e910b0938aeed4a2975b4b4f48922fdc0/2e223/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-june-2020-data-transfer.png" alt="AWS data transfer billing break down"></p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46294144a86a5d64df074d306386b3024b7d882a/af2d6/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/june-23-24-2020-s3-breakdown.png" alt="S3 Activity"></p><p><strong>30.6 TB?!?!</strong> how is that even possible???<br>$1,011.59 on 23 June 2020.<br>$1,639.07 on 24 June 2020.</p><p>I immediately open a ticket with AWS Support frantically wondering what broke? How is this even possible? Did someone bypass Cloudflare? What the hell is Cloudflare saying?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6cd3322753f262dc51bbca44a07fef6b19b381e9/52aec/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_22_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 22 June 2020"><br>Oh cool, Cloudflare let those 2,700 requests passthrough completely uncached? How is that not anomaly detected as a DDoS??? How is it that barely a fraction of the traffic is cached (more on that later)?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a0f7d1526c44cb74baba13f749f3d5a886bbdadb/6d2b1/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_23_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 23 June 2020"><br>Oh, another 4,400 requests the next day… Sweet, baby Jesus. Oh, but you served 9 GB from cache. Thanks, Cloudflare.</p><h2 id="help-arrives">Help Arrives</h2><p>Apparently, when you tweet something crazy af, like a $2700 AWS bill, it gets a lot of attention on a quiet holiday morning. A quarter-million people saw the tweet and a third of them interacted with it. It was enough attention that the AWS Support Twitter account was on it before, <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1186319925901586432">my friend</a> and <a href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/">cloud economist</a>, Corey Quinn.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh no! 😰 Sorry to hear about this unpleasant Saturday morning surprise, Chris. Please create a support case so our agents can help get to the bottom of this: <a href="https://t.co/weTUnSYLRU">https://t.co/weTUnSYLRU</a>. 🕵️‍♀️ ^HG</p>— AWS Support (@AWSSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSSupport/status/1279424879566163970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><br>Praise Twitter for at least its ability to draw attention to things. I am not sure this would’ve ended up as well as it did without it.<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/tUrNnXqWMY">pic.twitter.com/tUrNnXqWMY</a></p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1279446759664611329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><br>I forwarded the bill to Corey almost immediately after seeing it at pre-dawn west coast time. I am forever thankful to Corey for his analysis. When he was ready, Corey sent me a list of things he needed to do an analysis (instead, I created him a regular IAM account with the proper perms 😉 and yes I cleaned up after).<p>Corey encouraged me to apply a bucket policy that would only allow Cloudflare IP addresses to access anything from the bucket. The theory here is that someone could have been bypassing Cloudflare somehow. But, thankfully, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">Cloudflare publishes their IP blocks</a> and they don’t change all that often. The Cloudflare support article, <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037983412-Configuring-an-Amazon-Web-Services-static-site-to-use-Cloudflare#77nNxWyQf69T1a78gPlCi9">Configuring an Amazon Web Services static site to use Cloudflare</a> gives you an example bucket policy to do exactly that. This should become a standard practice for folks. However, it wouldn’t have mattered in this case; more on that later.</p><p>Corey Quinn’s thread on the topic covers what happened on the AWS side pretty well:</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That's right--it's threading time!<a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@chrisshort</a>'s surprise <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@awscloud</a> bill of $2700 looks S3 driven... <a href="https://t.co/VnXufn24iA">https://t.co/VnXufn24iA</a> <a href="https://t.co/tKLWv5rHtW">pic.twitter.com/tKLWv5rHtW</a></p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280280727133642753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a></blockquote><ul><li>”…it’s almost entirely due to us-east-2 data transfer out…”</li><li>“Now, what caused this? Nobody knows!”</li><li>“Chris Short isn’t some random fool…” (Might be the nicest thing Corey’s every said about anyone he’s not related to)</li><li>”‘Surprise jackhole, your mortgage isn’t your most expensive bill this month, guess you shoulda enabled billing alarms!’ is crappy, broken, and WOULD NOT HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM!”</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280289410844471296?s=20">“I want to be explicitly clear here: Chris Short didn’t do anything wrong!”</a></li></ul><h2 id="but-wait-there-s-more">But wait! There’s more!</h2><p>I had tickets in with Cloudflare (1918916) and AWS (7153956931). Cloudflare was the least helpful service I could have imagined given the circumstances. A long term user and on and off customer thinks they were attacked for two days and you don’t lift a finger? If I didn’t have reason enough to move off of Cloudflare, I do now. That’ll be an update for a later blog post. But, if you work for a CDN company and you’re relatively painless to get up and running, I’m interested in hearing from you.</p><p>After a very chaotic morning, I take Corey’s advice, disconnect, and enjoy the holiday weekend.</p><h2 id="more-help-arrives">More Help Arrives</h2><p>On July 8th, an astute AWS employee starts doing some digging around and reaches out to me. Because they see this as bafflingly as Corey and I do. How did so few requests generate so much traffic so quickly and then as soon as it appears, it’s gone again? It doesn’t seem like something intentionally malicious either because Cloudflare and AWS let it right on through.</p><h3 id="here-s-the-theory">Here’s the theory</h3><p>In hindsight, I made a poor decision to distribute a trial Windows 2019 SQL Server virtual machine images (fully patched with all necessary drivers and VM extensions) in the form of a qcow2 file. Someone became aware of the existence of this VM image. They then stood up hundreds, potentially thousands, of copies this VM using the internet accessible URL. This is, in theory, possible, with something like <a href="https://chrisshort.net/tags/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://kubevirt.io/">Kubevirt</a>. Given that the disk image becomes a volume mount in the corresponding VMs pod. Spin up enough copies of the VM, a single YAML file can create infinite copies of a VM. If the YAML definition directly referenced the Cloudflare or S3 URL and not a locally cached copy, you can rack up the number of times you pull down an image real quick. The qcow2 image, in this case, was 13.7 GB. But it’s trickier than that.</p><h3 id="the-sharp-edge-of-the-cloud">The sharp edge of the cloud</h3><p>File this under, “Things I should’ve known but didn’t.” Did you know that “The maximum file size Cloudflare’s CDN caches <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#:~:text=The%20maximum%20file%20size%20Cloudflare's,request%20caching%20of%20larger%20files."><strong>is 512MB</strong></a> for Free, Pro, and Business customers and 5GB for Enterprise customers.” That’s right, Cloudflare saw requests for a 13.7 GB file and sent them straight to origin every time <em>BY DESIGN</em>. <strong>Ouch!</strong></p><p>I suspected these files immediately on July 4 and moved them to an internal work GDrive for the time being. If you need the images, let me know, you’re also a suspect if you ask for them, be warned.</p><p>If you’re sitting at home doing the math, something might not be adding up. The bandwidth cost is off, there was indeed some legitimate traffic to the bucket in June, of course, But, as it turns out the intrepid AWS employee discovered that 3655 partial GETs to the object might have actually been delivered as full file requests and Cloudflare might have ever done anything with them. Yes, this is a bug somewhere and folks are looking into it. I also suggested that object size limits be a tunable S3 bucket policy. This way, I wouldn’t have even been able to upload the files to the bucket, to begin with.</p><h2 id="the-resolution">The Resolution</h2><p>As I mentioned, I’ve removed the multiple gigabyte files from the bucket the day I got the bill (July 4). <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280282363461726208">Corey pointed that out here</a>. That might have hindered the investigation from the AWS side. I won’t be so quick to delete in the future. I will lock files down though. But, let’s face it. Now that I’m aware of the <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#:~:text=The%20maximum%20file%20size%20Cloudflare's,request%20caching%20of%20larger%20files.">512 MB file limit at Cloudflare</a>, I am moving other larger files in that bucket to <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> for now (and will add them to my supported <a href="https://chrisshort.net/causes/">Causes</a>).</p><p>Long term, I won’t want to store files in …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Slowsort is a sorting algorithm that is designed to be deterministically sub-optimal. The algorithm was published in 1986 by Andrei Broder and Jorge Stolfi in their paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2805500_Pessimal_Algorithms_and_Simplexity_Analysis">Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis</a> where they expressed a bunch of very in-efficient algorithms. These techniques and algorithms are special because they never make a wrong move while solving a problem, instead, they find ways to delay the success. In this essay, we put our focus on the Slowsort algorithm based on the <em>Multiply and Surrender</em> paradigm.</p>

<p>The <em>Multiply and Surrender (MnS)</em> paradigm, is a humorous take on the popular <em>Divide and Conquer (DnC)</em> technique. MnS splits the problem into subproblems, slightly simpler than the original, and continues doing so recursively for as long as possible. The subproblems are multiplied and the evaluation is delayed till the state that the solving could not be further postponed and then it surrenders.</p>
<p>MnS paradigm is very similar to DnC; but where the DnC actually splits the problems into subproblems to reach the solution quicker, MnS does it to procrastinate, making the entire process very inefficient but yet convergent.</p>
<p>Although Slowsort is a classic example, recursive Fibonacci with no memoization also fares under the MnS paradigm. The recursive code to find <code>n</code>th Fibonacci number is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span><span>(n)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""the function returns the `n`th fibonacci number
    """</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>

    
    
    <span>return</span> fib(n - <span>1</span>) + fib(n - <span>2</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>While computing the Fibonacci numbers, we split the problem into subproblems and do this recursively till we are left with elemental states i.e. <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> and which is when we return the initial values which are <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>. This approach is not DnC because we are not splitting the problem into subproblems to achieve optimality, instead are doing a lot of repetitive work and taking a non-polynomial time to generate the Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>Slowsort algorithm draws a lot of similarities to the very popular Mergesort, but while Mergesort operates in <code>O(n . log(n))</code> the complexity of Slowsort is non-polynomial <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> and its best case performs worse than the worst case of bubble sort.</p>
<p>Slowsort algorithm recursively breaks the array sorting problem into two subarray sorting problems and a few extra processing steps. Once the two subarrays are sorted, the algorithm swaps the rightmost elements such that the greatest among the two becomes the rightmost element of the array i.e. the greatest among the two is placed at the correct position relative to each other, and then it invokes the sorting for all elements except this fixed maximum.</p>
<p>The algorithm could this be expressed as following broad steps</p>
<ul>
<li>sort the first half recursively</li>
<li>sort the second half recursively</li>
<li>find the maximum of the whole array by comparing the last elements of both the sorted halves and place it at the end of the array</li>
<li>recursively sort the entire array except for the maximum one</li>
</ul>
<p>The in-place implementation of the Slowsort algorithm is as illustrated below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>_slowsort</span><span>(a, i, j)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the integers in the array
    spanning indexes [i, j].
    """</span>
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> i &gt;= j:
        <span>return</span>

    
    
    
    m = (i + j) // <span>2</span>

    
    _slowsort(a, i, m)
    _slowsort(a, m + <span>1</span>, j)
  
    
    
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> a[m] &gt; a[j]:
        a[m], a[j] = a[j], a[m]
  
    
    
    
    _slowsort(a, i, j - <span>1</span>)


<span><span>def</span> <span>slowsort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""in-place sorts the array `a` using Slowsort.
    """</span>
    _slowsort(a, <span>0</span>, len(a) - <span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The Slowsort algorithm typically replaces the <code>merge</code> function of the Mergesort with a simple swap that correctly places the largest element (local maxima) and then invokes the sort function on all but this element. So on every invocation, we keep correctly placing the largest element but in a recursive manner.</p>
<p><em>A visualization of this algorithm could be found in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRoyhGdjnA">youtube video</a>.</em></p>

<p>The runtime of Slowsort could be computed by the following recurrence relation</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473102-cb594e80-cf37-11ea-9015-217c3eda50d6.png" alt="slowsort recurrence relation"></p>
<p>When the above recurrence relation is solved and we find that the asymptotic lower bound for <code>T(n)</code> is given by</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88473128-14a99e00-cf38-11ea-905b-f3f473a0d74c.png" alt="lower bound of slowsort"></p>
<p>The above expression suggests that lower bound of Slowsort is non-polynomial in nature and for a sufficiently large <code>n</code> this would be more than <code>n ^ 2</code> implying that even the best case of Slowsort is worse than the worst case of Bubble sort. The illustration below compares the time taken by Slowsort and the recursive implementation of Bubblesort.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/88475549-8e4c8680-cf4e-11ea-8ee4-9f7ed345ff5d.png" alt="slowsort vs recursive bubblesort"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iterative implementation of Bubblesort stood no chance in terms of time taken for smaller sets of integers, hence the chart was plotted against the recursive implementation of it. The iterative bubble sort for smaller arrays is nearly flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Bogosort</a> is a sorting algorithm that has an average case time complexity of <code>O(n!)</code> and an unbounded time in the worst case. The algorithm keeps on permuting (shuffling) the array till it is sorted which introduces an unboundedness in its implementation and hence the algorithm is considered to be the worst sorting algorithm ever.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>is_sorted</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> all(a[i] &lt;= a[i + <span>1</span>] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(a) - <span>1</span>))

<span><span>def</span> <span>bogosort</span><span>(a)</span>:</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>not</span> is_sorted(a):
        random.shuffle(a)
</code></pre>
<p>The reason that we should rate Slowsort highly is the fact the Bogosort could sort the list in its first shuffle while Slowsort is deterministic and will take <code>O(n ^ log(n))</code> time in best case scenario.</p>
<p>A rule that every algorithm follows is that every step that it takes actually makes some progress towards the final goal. Bogosort does not guarantee progress, and since it randomly shuffles the array, at one iteration we could end up at a nearly sorted array while the next shuffle takes us afar.</p>
<p>Slowsort is deterministic and convergent. The number of swaps made (inversions) during the execution is non-increasing which means once two items are swapped they are in the correct order relative to each other. In other words, we say that Slowsort never makes a wrong move.</p>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Manager</td>
<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP/UDP</th>
<th>Port</th>
<th>What is for?</th>

<p>It is strongly recommended to have at least three manager nodes in production cluster for HA. This configuration will survive lost of one manager node.<br>

      <p>
        <span>Emergency Remote is a book of opportunity. It lights the way to turn a forced
          remote work situation into a great management success. It contains simple steps
          that will help you not only keep operating, but blow away the competition.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Some believe they can work from home as if they are in the office. "Just add
          some tools for video calls and everything will work just fine", they say.
          This cannot be further from the truth. Setting up video is to successful remote
          work as setting up tables is to successful onsite work. You'll probably use
          it, but it's not nearly enough.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Emergency Remote is divided into three succinct sections. The first discusses the
          underlying values required for remote work to function, the second ensures the
          right tools are set up, and the third describes the five immediate actions to
          perform for better remote work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is an easy, quick read. In fact, the average reader will finish the book in
          less than 15 minutes. After following it you'll have enough space to learn
          from the vast resources on remote work </span><span>available </span><span>online and adjust them to fit your company.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>Remote work is composed of three pillars that are crucial to the success of the
          method. They are important to understand before going forward with
          implementation.</span>
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="h.rrpubh4i8p5v"><span></span></h2>
      
      <h2 id="h.1fqjja11bgze"><span>Trust</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is your belief in a colleague's ability to deliver work in the best
          possible way. Note, this does not mean a guaranteed delivery every time, but the
          ability to deliver. It includes asking for help if needed, recovering from
          mistakes and improving for next time.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is essential because trusting others allows you to focus on your actual
          work, knowing they'll deliver. When others trust you, you get that unique
          peace of mind, the freedom to do your work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without trust, employees will be agitated. Worried that their own work will be
          wronged by employees they rely on, either directly or indirectly. That is an
          impossible way to work, especially remotely.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.1cdix8fys4aq"><span> </span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.vvx9who9kf19"><span>Evergreen Communication</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication achieves productive work and </span><span>always-available </span><span>conversations. Both are "evergreen"</span><span>,</span><span> meaning preserved. To accomplish </span><span>that</span><span>, </span><span>two things are needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>First</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>asynchronous (async) communication</span><span> —</span><span> communicati</span><span>on</span><span> without the expectation of immediate response.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Second</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>history preservation</span><span>. </span><span>C</span><span>onversation</span><span>s</span><span> should be kept whole and in orde</span><span>r</span><span>, forever.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication is essential because it allows employees to always work on
          what's most important, always be up to date, and have the reasoning behind
          every decision at their fingertips. They can jump into any conversation that needs
          them, and answer without sacrificing productive work. New employees could even
          onboard themselves.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without </span><span>Evergreen</span><span> </span><span>Communication</span><span>, we're back to square one. Having everyone present, either in a chat, call
          or physical room forces participants to stop ongoing productive flow. Incomplete
          summaries, as they always are, </span><span>c</span><span>ause information loss and make the reasoning behind decisions </span><span>v</span><span>ague at best.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.i59vuej2ah6f"><span></span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.30fd3thx8ylx"><span>Independence</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Independence is the state where the employee(s) working on a task needs little to
          no outside involvement. This does not mean that employees will work in silos. Some
          tasks require more than one person to perform. If most tasks require one person,
          it means they are small (as they should) and that team cooperation will take place
          when joining the individual tasks to form a whole.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is essential because it makes sure each and every task is self-contained. That
          is, the employees responsible for it have all they need in order to deliver, and
          the risk of them being blocked is reduced. Further, increasing employees'
          resources in this way increases innovation, which again contributes to
          production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without independence, productive work is undermined. The business will be tangled
          with permissions requests, employees will be blocked by their privileged
          counterparts, and innovation will halt at the face of bureaucracy. All of these
          are detrimental, more so in a remote environment, where bureaucracy is harder to
          deal with, and therefore should be prevented.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>You will only need four tools to be productive remotely. A tool used as a single
          source of truth and three tools used for the three forms of communication: async,
          hybrid and sync. That's it.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>All employees should have access to as much material as your company's level
          of transparency allows, without complex permissions or process.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Each tool will have an example using a specific brand. While many brands supply
          these tools, make sure to only use one for each categor</span><span>y</span><span>. Different teams prefer different tools, but they cause duplication and
          fragmentation, which harms productivity.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 id="h.ga1500ptl4sj"><span></span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.vkvqh8m4qqe0">
        <span>Single Source of Truth</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>The Single Source of Truth is a website or collection of files that always
          represent the up-to-date and true state of work. It must adhere to Evergreen
          Communication and track changes and their reasoning, allow rollbacks to previous
          versions and keep communications async.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Once this is set up, everyone should always update the work and communicate in
          regards to the single source of truth. Gone are the days of files scattered across
          various emails.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span>
          Google Docs for a law company will hold all strategies, contracts, company
          policies, and so on. Every change done for the client or </span><span>to</span><span>
          company policy will be reflected immediately to all involved. Changes are always
          tracked, previous versions preserved, and </span><span>d</span><span>iscuss</span><span>ions are evergreen</span><span>.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h2 id="h.tqqlh9vccq1a">
        <span>Async Communication: Task Manager</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Tasks should be managed using a task manager, a type of software. </span><span>They</span><span>
          should be discussed and when done, changes should be made to the source of truth.
          Task managers are completely async, have reproducible history to understand </span><span>past</span><span>
          decisions, and always show the state of work, making status meetings
          redundant.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>This is the hardest tool to choose, as it is company specific. Take </span><span>time</span><span>
          to test different options. If the one you have doesn't work for you, change
          it. Communicate this to your employees</span><span>. P</span><span>revent disruption </span><span>with gradual adoption</span><span>. </span><span>You will find one that works.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #1:</span><span> Trello or Asana for a law firm. </span><span>E</span><span>mployees could open tasks, involve others and</span><span> jump i</span><span>n to help. A paralegal may open a task "Fix typo in website", the IT
          person may reply "Currently overwhelmed", then a secretary may jump in
          "I've built website</span><span>s </span><span>before, can I help?". This kind of </span><span>exchange is impossible</span><span> to achieve without the three pillars</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>It</span><span>
          happens in remote companies every day, boosting the heart of the</span><span>ir</span><span> production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #2:</span><span> GitLab for software companies. </span><span>These apps</span><span> often double as a source of truth </span><span>with</span><span> their code hosting function and as task managers </span><span>with</span><span> their ticketing (issues, pull requests) system.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.ga1500ptl4sj"><span></span></h2>

      <h2 id="h.siasagdslt5x">
        <span>Hybrid Communication: Chat App</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>While the bulk of communication should be done using the task manager, sometimes
          we need to quickly hash things out. This is where chat apps come into play. They
          are hybrid, neither async n</span><span>or</span><span>
          sync. While it's possible to reply later, it's not easy. </span><span>M</span><span>essages come and go</span><span>,</span><span> pushing people to </span><span>respond immediately</span><span>.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Therefore, for work talk, use these only for quick, ephemeral conversations. Any
          long lasting or high impact communications should use the task manager. Outside of
          work talk, chat plays a big role in socializing and enjoying each other's
          company, an important aspect to preserve when working </span><span>remotely</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Avoid email or WhatsApp as much as you can. They are private by nature and make
          it harder for people to jump in if needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span> Slack</span><span> or any </span><span>app </span><span>with</span><span> private messages</span><span> and </span><span>public channels will do. Employees could publicly commend a team member for good
          work in the general channel, or offer feedback privately. They could hop into the
          memes and music channels for fun, ask in the IT channel if anyone noticed a system
          slowdown, or share research about </span><span>new</span><span> strategies in the marketing channel.</span>
      </p>

        <span>Sync Communication: Video/Voice Calls</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Sync communication makes sense in a few cases. Usually for brainstorms and when

<p><img src="http://www.wjwh.eu/images/haskell-logo.png" title="Haskell logo"><br>
Haskell provides lightweight user space threads that get scheduled by the Run Time System (RTS) onto a limited number of operating threads in a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#M:N_(hybrid_threading)">M:N threading model</a>. To handle blocking there are a few options, <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">about which I have written before</a>. For system calls on file descriptors that can return <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, the RTS provides an I/O (not to be confused with <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_IO"><code>IO</code></a>) event manager where threads can register interest in a file descriptor before putting themselves into a sleeping state. If and when the file descriptor becomes available for reading or writing, the event manager will <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">wake up</a> any threads that have registered interest in it. The event manager system contains a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs">manager module</a>, which provides the interface for the rest of the Haskell code. This module will choose the most performant option from <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs#L169-178">a number of backends</a> available on the current system. So, it will choose the <code>epoll</code> backend on most Linux systems, the <code>kqueue</code> backend on BSD systems, etc. This article is about the design and first results of a new event manager backend based on the <code>io_uring</code> interface.</p>
<p><em>Side note: quite recently a native I/O manager for Windows systems was merged into GHC. Sadly, I don’t know enough about it yet to meaningfully include it into this article. As such, the information provided is only valid for POSIX-like systems.</em></p>
<p>The <code>io_uring</code> interface was added in the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-5.6-IO-uring-Tests">Linux kernel version 5.1</a> as an improvement to the earlier <code>aio</code> interface for asynchronous system calls. It operates by allocating two ring buffers that are shared between the kernel and the userspace program, known as the Submission Queue (SQ) and the Completion Queue (CQ). The program puts any number of system call requests (known as Submission Queue Entries (SQEs)) into the SQ and can submit any number of them to the kernel with a single system call. The kernel then goes off to do the things requested and when (or if) the request is complete the result will be put into the CQ as a Completion Queue Entry (CQE). This means that the userspace program can check if any CQEs are available merely by checking the CQ, without having to do any system calls. This potentially saves a lot of work on context switches between the kernel and userspace for I/O heavy programs like web servers. As of the time of writing, there are SQEs available for file reading/writing, accepting network connections, polling file descriptors and several more. The author of the <code>io_uring</code> interface has stated that he intends to eventually provide asynchronous versions of all system calls where it makes sense. To implement an I/O event manager backend with <code>io_uring</code>, we only need the SQEs for polling and cancelling previous poll requests, but it would be interesting to see how much of <code>io_uring</code> could be leveraged to provide “true” asynchronous system calls in the future.</p>
<h2 id="iouring-backend-design">IoUring backend design</h2>
<p>Any I/O event manager backend must conform to <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Internal.hs#L25-51">the interface defined for it</a>, which looks like this:</p>

<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27"></a>    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That seems pretty reasonable, only four functions! Actually, there is also a <code>new</code> function to set up the backend so it’s more like five functions. ACTUALLY actually, the <code>_beModifyFd</code> function has three different modes of operation depending on which of its arguments are <code>mempty</code>. It can be either “add a polling request”, “modify a polling request” or “delete a polling request” so it is more like seven functions. Still, that is quite manageable. The interface description even describes what each function should do and which arguments it takes, which is more than I usually got in my previous day job.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/bgamari">Ben Gamari</a> had already written Haskell <a href="https://github.com/bgamari/io-uring">bindings</a> for using <code>io_uring</code> that could be adapted for an I/O manager backend. He was also a huge help in finding a segfault-causing bug that I would never have caught myself. Many thanks!</p>
<p>An interesting implementation detail of <code>io_uring</code> is that every SQE has a <code>userdata</code> field that gets copied over verbatim into the CQE for its completion. As we can see in the type signature for <code>_bePoll</code> we need both the original file descriptor and the events to issue the callback. In the earliest version, the new backend generated a unique <code>Int</code> for each request and stored this information (along with a Bool indicating whether the poll request was a “multishot” or not) in a hashtable. This worked, but testing showed that throughput was only about half of what the <code>epoll</code> backend could provide. After some discussion on the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, we realized that it was possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field">bitpack</a> all the required data into the 64-bit <code>userdata</code> field. This cleared up the code significantly and provided a nice speed boost as well.</p>
<p>The code of the new backend can be found <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/WJWH/ghc/-/tree/io_uring_manager">over here</a>. At its heart, it is a <code>popAndCallbackAllCQEs</code> function. It is implemented as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- The workhorse of this backend. Pops CQEs off the ringbuffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- and issues callbacks to waiting threads</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>popAndCallbackAllCQEs ::</span> <span>UringState</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>Fd</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>EI.Event</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>popAndCallbackAllCQEs state callback <span>!</span>poppedSoFar <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>  maybeCQE <span>&lt;-</span> withMVar (ringLock state) <span>$</span> \ring <span>-&gt;</span> popCq ring</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  <span>case</span> maybeCQE <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>    <span>Nothing</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>return</span> poppedSoFar</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>    <span>Just</span> cqe <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>      <span>let</span> (fd,originalEvents,isMultishot,hasCallback) </span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a>                              <span>=</span> (deconstructUserdata <span>$</span> cqeUserData cqe)</span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>      when (hasCallback) <span>$</span> callback fd (convertEventBack <span>$</span> cqeRes cqe)</span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>      <span>-- if it was a multishot poll, resubmit. If it was an error,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a>      <span>-- don't resubmit to prevent getting into an infinite loop of errors</span></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a>      when (isMultishot <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cqeRes cqe <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>) <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>                void <span>$</span> registerAndPostPollRequest state fd originalEvents <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a>      popAndCallbackAllCQEs state callback <span>$</span> </span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a>                <span>if</span> hasCallback <span>then</span> (poppedSoFar <span>+</span> <span>1</span>) <span>else</span> poppedSoFar</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function pops CQEs off the CQ and after un-bitpacking the <code>userdata</code> field of the CQE, performs the callback. It then recurses until <code>popCq</code> returns <code>Nothing</code>, indicating that there are no more unread CQEs to be consumed. Even in this small bit of code it’s already clear how many edge cases can occur. Some backend-internal CQEs don’t have an associated callback, so for this case we should skip that. If a multishot poll request fails, blindly resubmitting might result in an infinite loop of erroring poll requests.</p>
<h2 id="test-results">Test results</h2>
<p>To test the relative performance of the <code>io_uring</code> backend compared to the <code>epoll</code> backend, I needed an application that spends as much of its time as possible on pollable I/O. The <code>network</code> package provides sample code for a simple echo server which I adapted into <a href="https://gist.github.com/WJWH/97a102791e6ee08d98cc20145d9ba29a">an extremely basic HTTP server</a>. This program was compiled twice: once with the <code>epoll</code> backend and once with the <code>io_uring</code> backend. Then two <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/"><code>t3.xlarge</code></a> VMs with 4 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM were acquired from AWS, one to host the test programs and one from which to run the <a href="https://www.petefreitag.com/item/689.cfm"><code>ab</code></a> HTTP load generator. I ran <code>ab</code> against each program in batches of 10.000 requests at concurrency levels of 5, 50 and 500 concurrent requests. To average out any jitter, each test run was performed three times and the results averaged.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.wjwh.eu/images/uring_graph_white.png" title="Haskell logo"><br>
</p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>io_uring</code> backend provides about 7% more requests per second (in this toy benchmark) at 5 concurrent requests, about 9% more requests per second at 50 concurrent requests and about 1.8% more at 500 concurrent requests. Presumably, at very high levels of concurrent requests other bottlenecks start to dominate performance. After sharing these findings in the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, I was advised to increase the size of the GC nursery to 16 MB (up from the default of 1 MB) and track the RTS performance statistics with the <code>-s</code> RTS option.</p>
<p>It turned out that at low concurrency the backends performed much the same, but at higher concurrency levels the <code>epoll</code> backend started spending much more time in garbage collection than the <code>io_uring</code> backend. This was mostly caused by the amount of retained objects being much larger for <code>epoll</code>, and as we all know <a href="https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html">GC time is related to heap size in Haskell</a>. In one particular case, <code>epoll</code> had a maximum residency of no less than 1,021,622,432 bytes (almost a full gigabyte) while <code>io_uring</code> reported a maximum residency of only 1,553,680 bytes, a reduction in memory use of almost 98.5%! This also resulted in GC pauses of almost 200 ms for the <code>epoll</code> backend to traverse all that memory, while the <code>io_uring</code> backend reported a maximum GC pause time of only 12 ms. Since most programs will also do other things than just report a single in-memory string back to callers this result is unlikely in “the real world”, but it is still remarkable. I suspect that the difference is caused by the <code>epoll()</code> syscall returning all the available file descriptors in a big array that the backend then <code>forM_</code>s over to perform the callbacks. The <code>io_uring</code> backend on the other hand can pop CQEs off the CQ one at a time and reclaim the memory for that CQE almost …</p></div></div>

<p>I’m no longer active on Facebook, but at the moment, oddly, it’s my main goto option to find out at least some of the companies that share my data.</p>



<p>Facebook lets you see who shared your data with them. There are two interesting pages, buried and well-hidden, worth checking: <strong>Off Facebook activity</strong> and <strong>Businesses who uploaded and used a list</strong>.</p>



<p>Want to see which companies are sharing your data? continue reading.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/activity_list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Off Facebook activity</a></h2>



<p>This one is very interesting and I recommend visiting the link to check our your own list. I won’t share the screenshot, but from what I gathered, all this information was leaked via apps on my iPhone, before I’ve disabled ad tracking. I’ve written about it before: <a href="https://blog.gingerlime.com/2020/does-apple-care-about-your-privacy/">Does Apple care about your privacy?</a> and I recommend reading it, if only to know how to disable ad tracking on your Apple devices.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Businesses who uploaded and used a list</a> </h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png 892w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-261x300.png 261w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-768x882.png 768w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure></div>



<p>My list can be divided to roughly 3 categories:</p>



<ol><li>Companies I know and use. Amazon, Uber, etc. So whilst they know me and I did give them my details, I <strong>never explicitly gave them consent to share my details</strong>. With Facebook or with anyone… </li><li>Companies I’ve heard of, but never signed-up for, used nor shared any details with. <strong>How the f*** do they even have my details?</strong> not to mention share them with Facebook (or who knows what other companies)</li><li>Companies I’ve never heard of, but <strong>the name alone looks really dodgy</strong>. “Mindshare Biddable Digital” … you can imagine what a company with this name is doing. </li><li>Dave M. Rogenmoser. He probably deserves his own category. I don’t know him, never heard about him, and frankly now want nothing whatsoever to do with him. Dave, if you’re reading this, WTF are you doing sharing people’s personal details with Facebook? especially people who you don’t know and definitely didn’t give you consent to share details of.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, so this was 4 categories I guess… Although Dave might more realistically fall into the 3rd one.</p>



<h2>What does it mean?</h2>



<p>In case you can’t read the text on the image, this is what Facebook tells us about it</p>



<blockquote><p>These businesses uploaded a list to Facebook. Lists can contain contact information, for example an email address or phone number that is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hashed</a> so that Facebook does not learn any new identifying information about you. Lists can also contain advertising identifiers instead of contact information. Information from lists is matched against our existing list of users. The identity of users is not revealed to the business during the matching process.</p><p>Facebook uses these lists only to match the information to your profile and to deliver the ads chosen by the advertiser. Facebook does not keep the information shared in these lists. Advertisers can use lists to show you more relevant ads or to exclude you from ads that may be less relevant to you. For example, if you’re already a member of a gym then the gym could choose to exclude you from ads about becoming a member.</p><p>Facebook doesn’t learn any new identifying information about users when lists are uploaded. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Learn More</a></p></blockquote>



<p>So, let’s decipher things a bit here, shall we?</p>



<h2>Hash data</h2>



<p>Technically, it’s true that Dave and his friends don’t share my personal details directly. i.e. they won’t upload my actual email address to Facebook. They will upload a <em>hash</em> of my email. But then, Facebook obviously holds its own giant list of hashed emails and other personal details, so then when two hashes match, Facebook knows that it’s me. That’s the way they can show me this list of companies.</p>



<p>So is this data sharing? I think every reasonable person would think so. Obviously now Facebook knows more about me. At the very least my (forced) association with those companies. Their claim that “Facebook doesn’t learn <em>any new identifying information</em>…” is technically true, but practically false, because this association is super valuable. Not only for allowing advertising to place ads, but I imagine to increase the richness of the user profile and what Facebook knows about you.</p>



<h2>Lookalike audiences</h2>



<p>I’m not 100% sure about this, but I think that’s another thing to worry about: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lookalike audiences</a>. When companies upload lists of emails to Facebook, they not only do it in order to target those users directly, but rather to also discover <em>similar</em> people. People who are likely to be interested in their ads.</p>



<p>So whilst Facebook doesn’t reveal any extra information about me directly with advertisers who upload my details, these companies get a huge “prize” for sharing my data with them: These companies are then able to <strong>target ads to people with similar interests to mine</strong>.</p>



<p>Add the fact that now Facebook knows more about us, because they not only see how we interact on Facebook or sites that use the Facebook like buttons etc, this practice feeds even more knowledge (and golden opportunity) to Facebook. So if they know X people who (like me) use Amazon, Uber, and Share Now, perhaps they are also likely to be interested in using Grab? So both Facebook and those companies have a <strong>clear interest sharing my data. But are they allowed to?</strong></p>



<h2>Legitimate business and consent</h2>



<p>Let’s leave Facebook out of it for a moment… Are these companies allowed to share information about me with <em>any other company</em> (Facebook or otherwise), without my explicit and informed consent?</p>



<p>I’m not a lawyer, but here’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/recital-40-lawfulness-of-data-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recital 40 of the GPDR</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>



<p>The way I understand it, personal data should be processed either based on “some other legitimate basis”, or on the basis consent.</p>



<p><strong>Legitimate basis</strong>, in very simple terms, is when the data is necessary to provide the service. For example, if I sign up to Amazon, they need my email to send me order confirmations. That’s a legitimate basis. But using my email for marketing or advertising stops becoming a legitimate basis. Why? because it is not <em>required</em> to provide the service that Amazon provides me.</p>



<p>So if Amazon wants to send me ads, or share my email for other purposes that aren’t realistically legitimate, they are <strong>required to ask for my informed and explicit consent</strong>.</p>



<h2>“But hey! They didn’t share your personal data! They only shared a hash…”</h2>



<p>Technically they “only shared a hash”, but this hash identifies me clearly. I believe it falls under personal data under the GDPR as well.</p>



<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the GDPR, Personal information</a> is (emphasis mine):</p>



<blockquote><p>… any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who <strong>can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as</strong> a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p></blockquote>



<h2>It gets even stranger</h2>



<p>If I dig a bit deeper into my list of companies, I saw that one of them actually shared my details with Facebook in order <em>not</em> to show me ads. This is actually one of the examples that Facebook gives when they explained about the Gym.</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for the Gym (they will not waste money on advertising someone who is already their member)</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for Facebook (they will sell more targeted ads, increasing the value of their platform to advertisers)</p>



<p>Is it good for me? some might say yes, because I won’t see the Gym ads any more. But at what price? I will still see other ads. And now Facebook knows that I’m a Gym member. I’m sure lots of advertisers would jump on the opportunity to sell me some Gym gear. I think I’m much worse-off here.</p>



<h2>What can we do about it?</h2>



<p>If you have a Facebook account, I highly recommend checking those two pages I linked to and seeing which companies are sharing your data.</p>



<p>The thing I wonder about most though, is what <em>other</em> companies my data is being shared with. Companies I have no way whatsoever to see such a list…</p>



<p>I guess the best thing to do is to contact these companies and ask them to stop it. Or to file a GDPR complaint. I would also recommend checking out <a href="https://noyb.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NOYB</a> (None Of Your Business). It’s a privacy non-profit organization that does some great work in this area. Sign up and become a member if you want to support their work further.</p>

<blockquote><p>How can I ensure my customer won’t share the video they purchased? Can I protect the PDF I sell to be shared only once? How can I lock my daughter in a high tower, so that no worldly harm befalls her?</p></blockquote>



<p>The tension between sharing our creations and being paid was always tricky. But the digital world adds another layer of complexity – your creations can be copied and distributed also <b>after the purchase</b>, keeping you out of the loop of future profits.</p>



<p>A natural instinct is to seek the answer in the technology that permitted sharing in the first place – can I protect the content I sold, so that only the customer has access to it?</p>



<p>Yes, but you shouldn’t. Over-protecting your content focuses on extraction over providing value. Here are 10 reasons why (Digital Rights Management)[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">1</a>] DRMs are a bad idea:</p>



<h3>1 – It is just impossible to prevent sharing</h3>



<p>Trying to effectively protect content against sharing is like fighting against skilled guerilla units in the digital jungle. Sure, you can deploy your defenses, but they will always find a sneaky way around them while you drain your resources.</p>



<ul><li>You will use streaming service to gate-keep your videos, They can use a project similar to `youtube-dl` to download any video file.</li><li>You will block downloading images on the page, they can just take a screenshot.</li><li>You can password protect a PDF, they can use a „virtual printer” to generate a new, open one.</li></ul>



<p>If you give a customer <b>any way </b>to access the content, that way can also be used to copy that content and/or record it.</p>



<p>This is a fundamental feature of the Internet. Content is meant to be easily reproducible and shared. The only way to win is to make it easier and more compelling to pay.</p>



<h3>2 – You are treating your customer like a thief</h3>



<p>Imagine if visiting your friend was like going through airport security. Did you bring any liquids? What’s that in your backpack? Oh no, your belongings are 300 grams too heavy, better pay for extra luggage!</p>



<p>Jumping through DRM hoops is sending a clear message to all your customers:</p>



<p><i>We don’t trust you. You have to go through this process because we think you may steal something. We’re watching you.</i></p>



<p>This message gets sent whenever a person who decided to pay you opens their purchase. It’s your biggest fans’ first experience with your product.</p>



<h3>3 – People who steal are not your customers</h3>



<p>Do you have a portrait of your ideal customer?</p>



<p>Is it a teenager sitting in a warez bulletin board all day and polishing his torrent workflow? If not – <strong>why are you focusing on them?</strong></p>

<h3>4 – But they may become them</h3>



<p>Sure Artur – but what about when somebody buys something and then gives away to all their friends?</p>



<ol type="a"><li>What do you think about sharing books? Borrowing a blender? Some sharing is healthy and natural.</li><li>It actually benefits <b>you</b>.</li></ol>



<p><b>Bootleg content is a customer acquisition mechanism.</b></p>



<p>The most successful Internet entrepreneurs build sophisticated sales funnels. For example, they would have many interactions with the customer before they buy:</p>



<ol><li>A visitor interested in your field finds your article online.</li><li>After the second article, they sign up for your email list.</li><li>You provide consistent value and build up trust.</li><li>After a few months, you release a product and the follower becomes a customer.</li><li>Profit.</li></ol>



<p>Even if they try to “convert” their friends to trust you too, the friend lacks the relationship you have built. They didn’t receive your emails and they didn’t laugh at your corny jokes.</p>



<p>Demonstrating the full value of intellectual property requires giving it away. Once the friend sees the value you provide, they will either:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>Be blown away by the quality.</li><li>Decide it’s not for them and they will never be your customer.</li></ol>



<p>Both of these outcomes are ideal for you and save you considerable time in the signup funnel and marketing.</p>



<p>This is what trial period and discounts aim to accomplish, but they have side-effects. When you repeatedly discount, customers start treating the lower price as the ‘real’ one, and value the product less because ‘it must not be worth the full price’. Keeping a blind eye to questionable behavior gives you a way out. You can demonstrate how valuable your product is, without discounts that lead to price erosion.</p>



<p>People who “sneak onboard” often become customers themselves – and even the most loyal ones! The converted always are.</p>



<h3>5 – You are making it hard to enjoy your content.</h3>



<p>Open standards empower creators to build new tools or use the content in unpredictable ways. Things are better connected. These are the core assumptions under which the Internet was built. You will not be able to predict all the weird, fantastic, and inspiring ways your content will be accessed.</p>



<ul><li>I may read your PDF on an iPad, iPhone, Android tablet, Kindle, or printed out,</li><li>I frequently save workout or yoga videos to watch while being offline in the garden or on the road,</li><li>I like to read the text in my Pocket or Kindle apps.</li></ul>



<p>Any sort of „protection” breaks my ways of consuming your content and often makes it useless for me. Sometimes enough to give up on something I have paid for (<i>and that is the reason I stopped doing yoga, your honor</i>).</p>



<div>
<h4>Sign up to get Deliberate Internet straight to your inbox</h4>
<p>I write about the psychological and technical aspects of the Internet, focusing on remote work, online economy, and cognitive load. Every monday.</p>






</div>



<h3>6 – You are blocking people with disabilities from accessing it at all.</h3>



<p>I can manage the inconvenience with some grumbling – however, not everybody has that luxury. Tools that people with disabilities rely on are by nature incompatible with any sort of content protection schemes. Content protection’s entire purpose is restricting access to the narrow subset of users and use cases.</p>



<p>Mind you, that <u>you yourself will join</u> those “people with disabilities”. You will get older, lose a little clarity in your vision, and suddenly the new sexy apps developed by 20-year olds in their glass palaces will become confusing and unusable.</p>



<p>Helping my grandparents navigate the changing digital landscape is a sad and sobering experience. Any additional hoop that you make them jump through may render your content inaccessible.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3>7 – You are turning your creation into a commodity</h3>



<p>The best online businesses rely on fostering the relationship between you and your customers. You share some free content, they are more receptive to trust you with their hard-earned money. It’s a dance of mutual respect and the first sale is only a part. If they like what you are doing, they will return for more, or even support you financially.</p>



<p>DRM software turns this delicate relationship into buying a sack of coal under the watchful gaze of security. <i>Not even a fistful too much! You are being watched</i>.</p>



<p>You are signaling to your customer that this is a purely monetary transaction. They are not entitled to even sharing your work with a friend, because they would be violating rules ?. Oh, the rules.</p>



<h3>8 – Are you really losing anything?</h3>



<p>If you are selling digital products, what is your marginal cost? How much do you pay to create another copy of your PDF, video, software?</p>



<p>When your content is being shared, it is <u>not stealing.</u> You don’t lose your income whenever somebody downloads a copy. As I mentioned – people who are likely to download illegal copies of your work are either never going to be your customers, or they will because they had a peek.</p>



<h3>9 – What is your true motivation for blocking the content?</h3>



<p>What is the core motivation for trying to protect your piece? Is it some misplaced sense of justice or is it legitimately best for your customer?</p>



<p>If that content truly makes you proud and you believe it would help them – what is the best outcome if the customer does not want to pay? Is this motivation coming from a place of fear?</p>



<ul><li>Fear of your work being „not good enough” to pay for?</li><li>Fear of the offer not being compelling enough?</li><li>Fear of not having enough paying customers to make it all worthwhile?</li></ul>



<p>Fear is not a good place to create amazing content people are going to love. This mindset will drag you down and prevent you from soaring into creative skies.</p>



<h3>10 – What do you choose to believe about people?</h3>



<p>Do you really want to believe that people are only waiting for an opportunity to steal? Or do you want to trust them to appreciate the value you provide?</p>



<h2>What can you do instead</h2>



<ol><li>Focus on the relationship with the customer. I have written a little more about it in<a href="https://piszek.com/2020/02/03/hospitality-vs-commodity/"> Your product is either hospitality or a commodity</a>.<br>I believe that all kinds of digital goods will be commoditized sooner or later. The only “moat” you can build is the customers’ trust.</li><li>Put the energy you would spend on DRM into innovation and creating new products. Once your old one gets shared, you should be already releasing a new one.<br>Subscriptions are an effective form of protection here – instead of sharing your content once, you drip the value to the customer – and they see the benefits of paying you.</li><li>Sell more. Get more paying customers – after all, it’s about how many customers <b>choose to pay you</b>, not how many choose not to.</li><li>Raise prices. Focus on the customer who is not driven to pay less, but the one who is driven to get more value. Paradoxically, more expensive products get downloaded less.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>Now go, create, and sell.</em></strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong><em>Note: this web article is an older version of a paper which has now been published as an ICFP Pearl. You can find a preprint of that paper <a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub-paper">here</a>.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>It’s probably better to read the paper rather than this post, as the paper contains more material, is more up to date, and is better explained!</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Algebraic subtyping</strong> is a new approach to global type inference in the presence of subtyping. It extends traditional Hindley-Milner type inference while preserving the principal type property — that is, it can always infer <em>the</em> most general type for any given expression. This approach was developed by <a href="http://stedolan.net/about/">Stephen Dolan</a> as part of his PhD thesis, along with Alan Mycroft.</p> <p>Algebraic subtyping was implemented in <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/mlsub/">the <strong>MLsub</strong> type inference engine</a>. However, the design of MLsub seems significantly more complex than the simple unification algorithms used for traditional ML languages. MLsub has proven harder to grasp, even for people already familiar with compilers and type systems, such as myself.</p> <p>Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I wanted to get to the bottom of the algebraic subtyping approach. What really is special about it, beyond the formalism? What are the simple concepts that hide behind the strange notions of <em>biunification</em> and <em>polar types</em>?</p> <p>This article is an answer to those questions. I propose an alternative algorithm for algebraic subtyping, called <strong>Simple-sub</strong>. Simple-sub can be implemented <strong>efficiently</strong> in <strong>under 500 lines of code</strong> (including parsing, simplification, and pretty-printing), and I think it is much more familiar-looking and easier to understand than MLsub.</p> <h4 id="---you-can-try-simple-sub-online-here---"><strong>⇨ ⇨ ⇨ <em><a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub/">You can try Simple-sub online here!</a></em> ⇦ ⇦ ⇦</strong></h4> <p>This article is meant to be light in formalisms and easy to consume for prospective designers of new type systems and programming languages.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/LPTK/simple-algebraic-subtyping">The complete source code of Simple-sub is available on Github.</a></p>   <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <ol> <li> <p><strong><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-mlsub">Algebraic Subtyping in MLsub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-simple-sub">Algebraic Subtyping in Simple-sub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#simplifying-types">Simplifying Types</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></strong></p> </li> </ol> <hr>  <p>The ML family of languages, which encompasses Standard ML, OCaml, and Haskell, have been designed around a powerful “global” approach to type inference, rooted in the work of <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1995158">Hindley</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2F0022-0000%2878%2990014-4">Milner</a>, later closely formalized by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582153.582176">Damas</a>. In this approach, the type system is designed to be simple enough that types can be unambiguously inferred from terms without the help of any type annotations. That is, for any unannotated term, it is always possible to infer a <em>principal type</em> which subsumes all other types that can be assigned to this term. For instance, the term $\lambda{x}. {x}$ can be assigned types $\mathsf{bool} \to \mathsf{bool}$ and $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, but both of these are subsumed by the polymorphic type $\forall a.\ a \to a$, also written <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>, which is the principal type of this term.</p> <p><strong><em>Hindley-Milner</em></strong> (HM) type inference contrasts with more restricted “local” approaches to type inference, found in languages like Scala and C#, which often require the types of variables to be annotated explicitly by programmers. On the flip side, abandoning the principal type property allows these type systems to be more expressive and to support features such as object orientation and first-class polymorphism. Note that in practice, even ML languages like OCaml and Haskell have adopted expressive type system features which, when used, break the principal type property.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p><strong><em>Subtyping</em></strong> is an expressive feature allowing types to be structured into hierarchies (usually a subtyping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)"><em>lattice</em></a>) with the property that types can be <em>refined</em> or <em>widened</em> transparently following this hierarchy. This lets us express the fact that some types are more precise (contain more information) than others, but still have a compatible runtime representation, so that no coercions between them are needed. For instance, in a system where the type <code>nat</code> is a subtype of <code>int</code>, one can transparently use a <code>nat list</code> in place where an <code>int list</code> is expected, without having to apply a coercion function on all the elements of the list. Subtyping can be emulated using somewhat heavy type system machinery (which both OCaml and Haskell occasionally do<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>), but first-class support for subtyping gives the benefit of simpler type signatures and better type inference.</p> <p>For a long time, it was widely believed that pervasive implicit subtyping got in the way of satisfactory global type inference. Indeed, previous approaches to inferring subtypes failed to support principal types or resulted in the inference of large, unwieldy typing schemes which included sets of complex constraints, making their understanding by programmers difficult.</p> <p><strong><em>Algebraic subtyping</em></strong> was introduced by Dolan and Mycroft as an ML-style type system supporting subtyping and global type inference, while producing compact principal types. Here, <em>compact</em> refers to the fact that the inferred types are relatively simple type expressions without any visible constraints, making them easy to understand by programmer. This was achieved by carefully designing the syntax and semantics of the underlying subtyping lattice, allowing for simplifying assumptions in to be made the constraint resolution process of the type inference algorithm.</p> <p>However, <em>biunification</em>, the algorithm proposed by Dolan in order to implement algebraic subtyping, has been quite difficult to understand for many experts and non-experts alike. Indeed, on the surface it looks quite different from the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_J"><em>Algorithm J</em></a> traditionally used for Hm type systems: it requires several additional concepts, such as bisubstitution and polar types, making it look more complicated.</p> <p>Thankfully, it turns out that algebraic subtyping admits a type inference algorithm, which I called <em>Simple-sub</em>, that is very similar to the familiar Algorithm J, and also much more efficient than biunification (or at least, than the basic syntax-driven form of biunification.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> In this article, I show that inferring algebraic subtypes is actually extremely easy, and can be done in under 300 lines of Scala code. Most of the complexity actually comes from simplifying the inferred type representations, which we will get to later.</p> <p>While the implementation we present is written in Scala, it is straightforward to translate into any other functional programming language.</p> <p><strong><em>The goal of this article</em></strong> is to recast algebraic subtyping into a simpler mold, allowing more prospective designers of type systems and programming languages to benefit from the great insights that this approach offers.</p> <hr>  <p>Let’s start by briefly reviewing what algebraic subtyping and MLsub are and what they are not, and by trying to assess their expressiveness.</p> <h2 id="term-language">Term Language</h2> <p>The term syntax of MLsub is given below. I have omitted boolean literals and if-then-else, as they can easily be typed as primitive combinators. I also used only one form of variables $x$, which will be sufficient for our use (Dolan’s MLsub formalism distinguishes lambda-bound variables from let-bound variables for technical reasons).</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$x$</td> <td><code>x</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>lambda</td> <td>$\lambda{x}. {e}$</td> <td><code>fun x -&gt; e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>application</td> <td>$e\ e$</td> <td><code>e e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record creation</td> <td>$\{\ l_0 = e \,;\; … \,;\; l_n = e\ \}$</td> <td><code>{ l_0 = e; ...; l_n = e }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>field selection</td> <td>$e.l$</td> <td><code>e.l</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>let bindings</td> <td>$\mathsf{let}\ x = e\ \mathsf{in}\ e$</td> <td><code>let x = e in e</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="type-language">Type Language</h2> <p>The type syntax of MLsub, summarized below, consists in booleans, function types, record types, type variables, top $\top$ (the type of all values — supertype of all types), bottom $\bot$ (the type of no values — subtype of all types), type union $\sqcup$, type intersection $\sqcap$, and recursive types $\mu{\alpha}. {\tau}$.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>primitives</td> <td>$\mathsf{bool}$, $\mathsf{int}$, …</td> <td><code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, …</td> </tr> <tr> <td>function</td> <td>$\tau \to \tau$</td> <td><code>t -&gt; t</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record</td> <td>$\set{\ l_0: \tau \,,\; … \,,\; l_n: \tau\ }$</td> <td><code>{ l_0: t, ..., t_n: t }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$\alpha $</td> <td><code>'a</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>top</td> <td>$\top$</td> <td><code>⊤</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>bottom</td> <td>$\bot$</td> <td><code>⊥</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>union</td> <td>$\tau \sqcup \tau$</td> <td><code>∨</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>intersection</td> <td>$\tau \sqcap \tau$</td> <td><code>∧</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>recursive</td> <td>$\mu\alpha. \tau$</td> <td><code>t as 'a</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="informal-semantics-of-types">Informal Semantics of Types</h2> <p>While most MLsub type forms are usual and unsurprising, two kinds of types require our special attention: set-theoretic types (more specifically union and intersection types), and recursive types.</p> <h3 id="set-theoretic-types">Set-Theoretic Types</h3> <p>To a first approximation, union and intersection types can be understood in set-theoretic terms: the type term $\tau_0 \sqcup \tau_1$ (resp. $\tau_0 \sqcap \tau_1$) represents the type of values that are <em>either</em> (resp. <em>both</em>) of type $\tau_0 $ <em>or</em> (resp. <em>and</em>) of type $\tau_1$.</p> <p>MLsub uses these types to indirectly constrain inferred type variables; for instance, one type inferred for term $\lambda{x}. {\set{l = x - 1 \,;\; r = x}}$ could be $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,,\; r: \alpha}$. This type reflects the fact that the original argument, of type $\alpha$, is returned in the $r$ field of the result record, as the input type $\alpha$ ends up in that position, but also that this argument should be able to be treated as an $\mathsf{int}$, expressed via the type intersection $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int}$ on the left-hand side of the function type. Keeping track of the precise argument type $\alpha$ is important: it could be later substituted with a more specific type than $\mathsf{int}$, such as $\alpha = \mathsf{nat}$, which would give us $\mathsf{nat} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,;\; r: \mathsf{nat}}$.</p> <p>On the other hand, there may be type signatures where some $\alpha$ becomes undistinguishable from $\mathsf{int}$. For instance, consider the term $\lambda{x}. {\mathsf{if}\ \mathsf{true}\ \mathsf{then}\ {x - 1}\ \mathsf{else}\ {x}}$, whose simplified inferred type would be just $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, as the seemingly-more precise type $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \alpha \sqcup \mathsf{int}$ does not actually contain more information (see the MLsub paper for details).</p> <p>The beauty of algebraic subtyping is that this sort of reasoning scales to arbitrary flows of variables and higher-order functions; for instance, the previous example can be generalized by passing in a function $f$ to stand for the $\cdot - 1$ operation, as in …</p></div></div>

July 26, 2020 | https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/07/24/Managing-One-Person.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/07/24/Managing-One-Person.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s easier to manage 4 people than it is to manage one person. The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report. Let’s dive deeper.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for a first-time manager to get a single direct report. Try it out. See how it goes. Here’s what this ends up looking like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new manager is over-reliant on making sure their single report likes them and is doing well. If they give feedback that their manager stinks, that’s 100% bad feedback from your reports. If the report doesn’t do well, that’s 100% of your reports that aren’t succeeding.* If the report quits, you just lost your whole team.</li>
  <li>The manager’s over-reliance on the direct report’s success and happiness leads to risk-averse behavior, like not giving critical feedback or overcompensating. It also regularly leads to micromanagement.</li>
  <li>The single report is isolated. They don’t have any peers on the team to reach out to for help. If their manager is bad, they don’t have any corroborating voices. Anything that goes wrong is a they-said I-said debate. Any debate inside of the team is a faceoff with your manager.</li>
  <li>No one in this relationship has the ability to get context. With more reports, a manager gets clearer signals when they’re wrong. A report could look to teammates to corroborate or dissuade their ideas. With one report, disagreements have little additional evidence, so people have to either approach the situation with a supreme lack of ego, or they can just assume it’s the other person’s fault. Guess which option happens most.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further the problematic conditions, the single report will often be a very junior hire. This compounds the issue. Straight-from-college hires don’t have great context for what it means to be in industry, to have a manager, to work a job with no end-of-semester in sight. And hires aren’t expected to have as much autonomy in their formative early years. With these variables, the requirements on the manager are higher than average.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for these relationships to turn sour. The manager makes mistakes as they always do. The report makes mistakes as they always do. Fingers are pointed. Times are dire. If you ever hear someone call their manager a “first-time manager”, you know the relationship has reached a special level of hell.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, consider doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid having first time managers have a team of 1 individual contributor for a prolonged amount of time. That team size is an <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/06/21/goldilocks-management-structure.html">anti-pattern</a> for more reasons than just this one.</li>
  <li>Try and make sure the manager of a team with 1 individual contributor is also an expert in the domain area. Sometimes managers are explicitly not the domain expert by design, but when you have 1 report, a lack of domain expertise is one of the sure-fire ways to make mistakes and a sure-fire way for your report to get the idea that you’re no good.</li>
  <li>Avoid at all costs the combination of: new manager, 1 report, report is new-to-industry, manager is not a subject-matter expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Note: mangers should be very invested in their report’s success. But when the manager is <em>over-invested</em> it leads to all sorts of unsavory things, some of which are called out above. Another example is when a report is doing well-enough, but because the manager is <em>over-reliant</em> on their performance, they try to push the report beyond what they can or want to do.</p>

		<p>I still remember some of the (written down) expectations I faced when I joined a high-profile consultancy in 2001. One of them was:</p><blockquote>"to effectively solve <strong>poorly-defined</strong> problems"</blockquote><p>The "poorly-defined" is the interesting part here. But at that point in time, it made a lot of sense. We've been paid <em>mucho dinero</em> to tackle whatever was to be tackled, regardless of "minor inconveniences". We couldn't appear helpless, drifting, or simply not smart enough to immediately start smashing obstacles (you know, the style over substance ;P). A client doesn't really know what they want? Well, we'll deliver it anyway!</p><p>I think the intentions behind the statement were fine &amp; reasonable. Even culture-wise, it was quite smart: own the problem even if it's not served on a tray, with a map and guidebook.</p><p>But the execution often used to get skewed &amp; twisted. And so it still does in numerous other companies nowadays:</p><ul><li>instead of solving the most important/meaningful problem, we navigate our efforts in a way to focus on the ones we fill comfortable with (e.g., technical ones, not business ones)</li><li>we keep mixing (various, co-existing, but inherently separate) problems and get lost in the meanders of their overlapping impacts</li><li>we mistake problems with their visible symptoms because fixing a visible effect is frequently much easier/cheaper than going for the full score</li></ul><p>All of those are results of <strong>poor problem definition</strong> (&amp; framing, &amp; scoping, etc.). Obviously, there are tools, techniques &amp; practices to deal with such challenges. However ...</p><p><br>..., there's a separate category of poorly-defined problems that are even harder to deal with. They are called <strong>"wicked problems"</strong> &amp; they are the main topic of this blog post.</p><p>What's wicked problem (WP)? Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">Wikipedia</a>, a wicked problem is ...</p><blockquote>... a problem whose <u>social complexity</u> means that it has no determinable stopping point.</blockquote><p>It's not the only definition provided, but I find it the best - very short &amp; perfectly captures what distinguishes WP. Take note - the challenge here is not the domain, technical or mechanical but SOCIAL complexity. In my case, it was enough to grab my attention.</p><p>This concept of WP comes straight from sociology and it's best to illustrate it by listing the key properties of a wicked problem (again, quoting Wikipedia)</p><ol><li>The problem is not (properly/correctly) understood until <strong>after the formulation of a solution</strong>.</li><li>Wicked problems have <strong>no stopping rule</strong> (criteria of being "solved").</li><li>Solutions to wicked problems are <strong>not right or wrong</strong> (in a binary way).</li><li>Every wicked problem is essentially <strong>novel and unique</strong>.</li><li>Every solution to a wicked problem is <strong>a "one-shot operation"</strong> (it's not possible to try it out / evolve it).</li><li>Wicked problems have <strong>no given alternative solutions</strong>.</li></ol><p>The most common wicked problems come from domains of economics, politics, global ecology, etc. Take an issue of handling COVID-19 pandemics, controlling the national debt/inflation rate, qualifying any Polish team to UEFA Champions League, dealing with recent migration movements in Europe, reducing traffic jams in Warsaw or preventing alcoholism &amp; drug abuse among adolescents.</p><p>Everyone knows these are actual, significant problems. Everyone has an opinion (on what would work best in each case), but it's not possible to come up with a consensus &amp; agree on a common way to deal with literally any of those problems. Wicked problems polarize opinions, escalate conflicts, slow down or event prevent any actions &amp; in the end - infuse the environment with helplessness &amp; frustration.</p><p>To be honest, there's a fascinating piece of theory behind "wicked problems" ("super-wicked problems", so-called "social messes" - yes, it's an actual term!, divergent vs convergent problems, etc.), so feel free to take a deep dive (the Wikipedia page linked above is a GREAT starting point), but the purpose of this article is different than playing with the academic considerations.</p><p>My point is: any work environment (it doesn't even have to be dysfunctional) is capable of growing nearly every problem from a category of a "standard" <strong>into the "wicked" one</strong>. It doesn't take the whole nation but only a bunch of individuals (with colliding standpoints, misaligned goals &amp; overgrown egos) to paralyze the organization &amp; cause the disorder. Examples?</p><ol><li><em>"Which web framework would work best in our next project we're just about to start?"</em></li><li><em>"How to deal with the technical debt we've accumulated for the past 5 years?"</em></li><li><em>"We'd like to have a unified logging mechanism across all X teams, but how to get there?"</em></li><li><em>"We have a bunch of components created 'the old way' and some in 'the new way' - how do we fix this situation?"</em></li></ol><p>Do these look familiar? Don't problems like that keep popping up (every few weeks) at your guild/status meetings, make people vent out for 40 minutes, until they get exhausted and you can move to the next point in agenda without anything conclusive?</p><p>I thought so. Yes, these are <u>your local, wicked problems</u>.</p><hr><p>Everyone has encountered some of those. The goal is to avoid creating them if possible. Here are my suggestions on what could help you in succeeding in that field. Do your best ...</p><ul><li>to put ALL the politics, religion and other social topics OUT of work environment (to avoiding mixing in the problems which are inherently wicked!)</li><li>to make sure that the decision-making policy in your organization is clear (it's known who makes the decision (the "owner" of the problem) &amp; what kind of responsibility it means)</li><li>to avoid "direct democracy" (and all sorts of committees) as a form of decision making</li><li>to dissect very clearly the diverging (brainstorming, looking for alternatives, building up knowledge) and converging (eliminating options to determine the best direction) phases of decision making</li><li>to be able to separate (unequivocally) the facts from opinions - because we're emotionally very closely attached to the latter, but the decisions should be based on facts whenever possible</li><li>to have a dedicated role of someone keeping the "discussion hygiene" high (by avoiding re-iterating topics, getting de-railed with meaningless edge cases or watering down precise issues)</li><li>to build up the "bias towards action" - because one can always come up with a reason not to do something (as it's safer &amp; doesn't make you personally accountable), but action is the engine of progress</li><li>to work out a habit of dissecting problems into smaller but independent ones - so the burden of decision-making is more bearable, there are less factors to consider and the decision itself is reversible/adjustable</li></ul>

<p>This is just a story of my day. It was an incredibly boring day. Why do I write about it? I analyzed why it was so dull and uncovered a great insight. What is the most critical factor in software engineering productivity? I think it is the time it takes to deploy your app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beautiful start of the day</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988.jpg" alt="The picture of an engineer writing code." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-ad60c7827ccce42ea134acdb3a46d988-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I woke up at around 10 am. Not too bad, given that I’ve stayed late the night before – I have been trying to solve an engineering problem at work. The problem was adding a new feature to the gigantic project with a not so scalable architecture. The project was born out of the hackathon, so it’s nobody’s fault… Anyway, the engineering problem. It wasn’t even that hard because as soon as I woke up, I had it all figured out in my head. I just needed my morning coffee first.</p>



<p>I started coding right after my first sip. Something really happened in my head during sleep, because it felt so easy to write code. The solution was pretty obvious, and it did not introduce any unneeded complexity to an already chaotic code base. It looked good, so I ran the code locally. Oh, yes, I forgot to import the module here. Oops, this variable is NULL now, let’s fix that. Okay, it seems to work now. So I committed changes to my branch and created a PR. It’s 11 am on the clock. Pretty sweet as a start of the day, ha? Now what? Even if I solved the problem, it’s not going to do much good without getting into production. Now it’s time to get my code to the finish line.</p>



<p>My open PR had automatically triggered tests. We have all kinds of tests: unit, integration, code style, you name it. I knew I had some time because this process is not usually fast. However, I didn’t have enough time to shift my focus to another task or fully relax. So I kept on checking my messengers, social apps, and news feed. Then a message arrived in Slack. “Lint-check failed.” Oh, I hate those! I thought I had everything right! Okay, it looks like I forgot to remove this import, and it’s not used anymore. I removed one line from the code and committed my changes. 5 minutes wait, again. What’s going on on Twitter?</p>



<h2>We all hate waiting</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg" alt="The picture of a man looking at his phone waiting for the code deploy to finish." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I did not notice how 15 minutes passed. Then I got another slack message – integration tests failed. At least my code style is right. So, I spent another 5 minutes fixing the issue (integration test actually did an excellent job catching a tricky bug, so I’m not mad at it). Then I committed my changes and played the waiting game again.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of tests, but 20 minutes, come on! Of course, I could’ve made some progress on another task, meanwhile. No, not really. I don’t know about you, but I hate switching focus. It takes so much time to get into a really focused state. So I’ve checked all my apps on the phone a couple times and found the bottom of the twitter feed before I saw a Slack notification about the successful deployment of my code. </p>



<p>Just to be safe, I need to test the app on production to see if the new feature works. From first glance, it did, but there was a small glitch. I had to update the code in the UI of a web application, nothing fancy, just changing a string. This turned out to be a header on the page, and I added redundant whitespace at the beginning, so now it looks weird. Okay, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now all tests passed, but the deployment took forever. I’m not sure what kind of computation is involved in moving a folder with files around 10 megabytes from my laptop to the server, but it sure feels like it could’ve trained a conscious AI by now. I don’t remember how much time it took for me to refresh the page and finally see the whitespace disappear, but it definitely took another cup of coffee. I managed to check my emails during this time, so I was productive, I guess. Anyway, it’s 2 pm, and it’s time for lunch.</p>



<h2>How much time we waste</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg" alt="The picture of a clock to illustrate time we waste when the deploy is slow." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>As you may have noticed, I’m complaining. That day I really spent around 1 hour actually solving an engineering problem, including bug-fixing time. But it took me 4 hours until I saw my changes in production. There are many days like this, so time adds up. I feel righteous anger because this thing is common in the industry, and many people experience the same thing.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Not writing tests? Of course, not, tests are freaking great. The issue is more generic – it’s all those inefficiencies that are easy to introduce to the deploy time (I bundle tests and all CI/CD stuff in the deploy time). It’s easy to write an inefficient CI/CD job. Its intent could be positive, and at the time, it may seem like a great idea. But a little delay is multiplied by the number of people working on the project and frequency of changes they make. Because deploy time affects EVERY contributor and EVERY code change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slow deploy means slow feedback loops. Imagine you’re an artist. Now imagine each time you move your brush on the canvas, you need to wait 5 minutes before the paint appears. That would be the most annoying thing ever.</p>



<h2><strong>The feedback loop (deploy) has to be fast</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg" alt="The picture of an artist that compares painting and seeing result with the feedback loop of software deploy." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I believe that each developer who likes to solve creative problems needs to have a fast feedback loop. You change the code – “snap” – it’s updated on the server – “snap” – you see the result.</p>



<p>Please think about this next time you want to add something to the deploy time. And also, think about improving deployment speed next time you work on technical debts. If you cut just 1 minute for a project with 5 contributors, each of them contributing once a day (only on workdays), it saves more than 100 hours a year. And I don’t know how to count improved productivity because of not having to switch the focus, but for me, it would multiply this time by 2 at least. To create better software, we need to improve how we write software.</p>



<p>PS. There is a great talk that inspired me&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a>. You should check it out, it’s mind-blowing.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://blog.grahamyooll.com/assets/images/copy-paste-twins.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As seen in numerous pull requests, the conversation goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: “Interesting solution. Where did this come from?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “I found it on Stack Overflow.”</p>

  <p>Me: “Did you copy/paste it?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Yes”</p>

  <p>Me: “Do you <strong>KNOW</strong> what it does?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Um… yeah.”</p>

  <p>Me: “What does it do then? What are the implications of this solution?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Let me find out…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I call, the Copy/Pasta Driven Development® pattern.</p>

<p>Don’t know what to do? Google it. Find it. Copy it. Paste it. Profit?</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>Everytime you select code from a browser, followed by pressing cmd+C and then cmd+V, I surmise you are robbing yourself of precious time to up your knowledge.</p>

<p>Copy/pasting is even more harmful, I argue, to more junior developers. Junior developers need to be able to bang their heads against a problem a bit before realizing their pitfalls, eventually coming out of the deep end with a clearer vision of the tools they use. By copy/pasting, you short circuit this learning opportunity, and end up looking for the “easy answers” without understanding <strong>why</strong> that is the easy answer.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I must say that copy/paste is a very powerful concept, something that we all do. Almost magical. However, just like everything in life, too much of something can be detrimental.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.grahamyooll.com/assets/images/victor-garcia-0yL6nXhn0pI-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>By copy/pasting, you are taking someone else’s answer to a very specific problem and using it for yours. On the face of it, that statement seems perfectly reasonable, right? But the trouble comes when you do not understand, or even worse, do not contemplate its interaction with your specific problem.</p>

<p>To build up the habit, referencing someone else’s answer to solve your given problem is perfectly valid. If you are to use the given solution, do not copy/paste it. Instead, line by line, type it out. While typing, go line by line figuring out what every variable, argument, loop, etc. is doing. Don’t know what that argument does? Look it up. Don’t get this loop? Write it out so you do understand it. The key here is not being able to understand the code you are writing, but being able to read code quickly. This practice will help with that.</p>

<p>Finally, yes, there are times to copy/paste. For instance, if you are doing something repeatedly and you understand its functionality, you probably can copy/paste. Even better, you should figure out how to automate that repetitive task. However, you should not be copy/pasting stuff that you don’t understand.</p>

<p>Take the couple of minutes to fully digest what is happening in the code you are executing. You will not regret it.</p>

<p>Bonus conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colleague: “Hey, Andrew, this piece of code doesn’t work like it’s supposed to. Could you take a look? My tests are failing, and I don’t know why.”</p>

  <p>Me: “Where did this new line come from?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “From this other file.”</p>

  <p>Me: “So, you copied it?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Yeah”</p>

  <p>Me: “Do you know what it’s doing then?”</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Not really…”</p>

  <p>Me: “Ok, then delete that code and start over without copy/pasting.”
10 minutes later I hear…</p>

  <p>Colleague: “Ohhhhhhhh!”</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>
Prospect, connect and converse with your leads at scale."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="FR">Monsieur Zoller,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">La
 Commission nationale pour la protection des données (CNPD) se permet de
 revenir vers vous concernant votre réclamation du 5 avril 2019 à 
l’encontre de la société RocketReach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cadre de l’instruction de votre réclamation, la 
société RocketReach nous a communiqué qu’elle considère que ce sont les 
utilisateurs de ses services, et non elle-même, qui sont les 
responsables du traitement pour ce qui concerne les
 données à caractère personnel traitées sur son site internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Par ailleurs, il ressort également de cette instruction 
que la société RocketReach est une société située aux Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique <b>ne disposant pas d’un représentant dans l’Union au sens de 
l’article 27 du règlement général sur la protection
 des données (RGPD). </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Au sujet des responsables du traitement établis dans des
 pays tiers, comme les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, nous souhaitons attirer 
votre attention sur le considérant (116) du RGPD qui précise que:</span></p>
<p>
«&nbsp;<i>Lorsque
 des données à caractère personnel franchissent
 les frontières extérieures de l'Union, cela peut accroître le risque 
que les personnes physiques ne puissent exercer leurs droits liés à la 
protection des données, notamment pour se protéger de l'utilisation ou 
de la divulgation illicite de ces informations.
 De même, les autorités de contrôle peuvent être confrontées à 
l'impossibilité d'examiner des réclamations ou de mener des enquêtes sur
 les activités exercées en dehors de leurs frontières. Leurs efforts 
pour collaborer dans le contexte transfrontalier peuvent
 également être freinés par les pouvoirs insuffisants dont elles 
disposent en matière de prévention ou de recours, par l'hétérogénéité 
des régimes juridiques et par des obstacles pratiques tels que le manque
 de ressources.&nbsp;»</i></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cas de votre réclamation cela signifie que, <b>bien
 que nous ne partagions pas le point de vue de RocketReach et que nous 
sommes au contraire d’avis que cette société est bien à considérer comme

réclamation</b>. En effet, nous ne disposons pas des pouvoirs de mener des 
enquêtes et de faire appliquer les décisions
 que nous serions amenés à prendre sur le territoire des Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Nous sommes dès lors au regret de vous informer que nous
 considérons qu’il nous est impossible de poursuivre de façon effective

<blockquote><b>English Translation</b><p>
Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.  Furthermore, it also emerges from this instruction that RocketReach is a company located in the United States of America that does not have a representative in the Union within the meaning of Article 27 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD).&nbsp;</p> <p>As regards data controllers established in third countries, such as the United States of America, we would like to draw your attention to recital (116) of the DPMR which states that: 'When personal data crosses the external borders of the Union, this may increase the risk that individuals may not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect themselves against unlawful use or disclosure of such information.</p><p>Similarly, supervisory authorities may be faced with the impossibility to investigate complaints or activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventive or remedial powers, heterogeneous legal regimes and practical obstacles such as lack of resources. »&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of your complaint, this means that, although <b>we do not share RocketReach's view and to the contrary believe <span>that RocketReach is the data controller</span> </b>for the processing of personal data on its website, <b>we are unable to take any further action in relation to your complaint.</b> We do not have the authority to investigate and enforce any decision we would have to take in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>We regret to inform you that we consider it impossible for us to proceed with the processing of your case.</b></p></blockquote>
<div><p>In Summary -&nbsp; Rocketreach has <b>not met the requirement</b> of the GDPR to name an EU representative (Art27) to account for the processing of European Personal Data. <b>In their answer, the CNPD makes it sound like it is optional, it isn't.</b> Instead of pursuing Rocketreach locally on that basis alone, the CNPD just gives up arguing it has no jurisdiction in the US.</p></div>

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case). The overall question you should ask is: Do we need a European Institution that handles extra-territorial investigations and fines? <b>Why should it take the time, money, and energy from an individual when the DPA is supposed to defend the rights of the data subjects</b>?</p>
<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to, or instead of measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;</span></span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-a0ba2051dedfb653ca45"><div><h3><strong>Building Beauty invites computer professionals to:</strong></h3><p><strong>Work, study, and conduct research with a network of&nbsp;Christopher Alexander’s colleagues and students</strong></p><p>The architect and urbanist Christopher Alexander, and his coworkers, produced a body of insights, practical methods, and research results, which inspired countless movements and products in the computer world -- from <strong>structured programming</strong> to <strong>design patterns</strong>; from the <strong>wiki</strong> to the <strong>sims</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these were side-effects. His major drive was to understand the <strong>nature of beauty</strong>, and the processes that create life and beauty in nature, so people could make beautiful things.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who wants to build beautifully, and anyone interested in resolving the countless troubles and problems in the world of computing, would benefit from understanding Alexander’s underlying research program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most direct way to do that, and the most engaged approach, is to study the material <strong>with a network of people who worked closely with Christopher Alexander</strong>, and who are continuing to develop his approach to theory and practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Building Beauty is an architectural graduate program. Its goal is to provide the opportunity to join this network and pursue this research.&nbsp;</p><p>If you work in <strong>computing</strong>, we invite you to study this material with us in its <strong>original</strong> form, for the<strong> built environment</strong> -- and join in parallel seminars, projects, and conferences to explore a disciplined, rigorous, and authentic recasting of this material, within the world of technology. We will pursue research in the natural sciences and explore the nature of engineering, while growing beautiful projects that move us towards a better world.&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Alexander made sure that his colleagues, no matter their background, went through&nbsp; fundamental, practical training on the nature of beauty. We've continued that tradition at the Building Beauty program. Now, in parallel, within our new Beautiful Software initiative, we’ll get everyone up-to-speed regarding ambitious technology that can assist in the spread of beauty. The first lesson is that putting nature, beauty, and feeling in the <strong>center</strong> of processes and practices will engender positive, revolutionary changes in the world we live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The case for beautiful software</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>There are <strong>three</strong> strange facts that force us to consider <strong>good</strong> software to be (among other things) <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>natural</strong>, compelling us to examine closely what these mean.&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>People can tell the <strong>difference</strong> between something that is natural -- that is, <strong>not</strong> man-made -- and something that is a human artifact.</p></li><li><p>However it's measured, <strong>nature</strong> makes <strong>more complex</strong> products than we can. Of course, the human species is an 'artifact' of nature, so we can never win that game.</p></li><li><p>Among the products of nature and humans, we judge the <strong>best</strong> to be 'natural and 'beautiful'.</p></li></ol><p>Regarding (1) -- of course it’s possible to fool people: with a photograph, for example. But when we do so, we are merely re-emphasizing that there <strong>is</strong> a perceptual faculty that reacts to impressions of natural structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (2) -- nature produces beauty and adaptation wonderfully. It's enviable. But nature's precise physical and chemical mechanisms are terribly complex and hard to uncover, while the mechanisms behind good software must be clear, consistent, and comprehensible. So why study natural processes? Because nature doesn't only work at a single, low-level scale. Nature works with overlapping layers of means and ends, which we can make immediate use of, it turns out, when we direct our efforts towards beauty and feeling. We don't need to copy nature exactly. We just need to do better, and natural processes provide the clues.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (3) -- there are many human artifacts and processes, even extremely 'popular', 'successful', and 'productive' ones, that are neither beautiful nor natural. This may be a good indication of a harmful product or process. Things that are popular, dominant, and stimulating are not necessarily good. But, unfortunately, by habit, and power projection through our society, bad results are often called 'best practices'. Learning to question dogmas is one of the most important skills one can develop in life and in the sciences -- along with an ability to piece together theories that displace the dogmas. This process of enlightenment, in the broad sense, should never end.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, even the most beautiful and natural software will do harm if it was not created freely and cooperatively, for the purpose of healing and helping people and nature. <strong>Responsibility</strong> is rarely practiced in the creation of any technology, but we need it: we won't survive unless we become truly, doggedly responsible.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll be examining these ideas and practices in our seminars and projects. <strong>You are all invited.</strong></p><p><strong>To express your interest in joining us, please write to </strong><a href="mailto:software@buildingbeauty.org"><strong>software@buildingbeauty.org</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

					<div><p>I have a strange relationship with hypomania. I LOVE IT but I know that what goes up must come down and when it comes down it <span><strong>REALLY</strong></span> comes down. And the next time is even worse than the last. The relief of coming out of depression and speeding towards hypomania is magical. Waking up and jumping out of bed, rushing to get dressed so I can go outside. So I can experience the sun on my skin, the air is fresh and the grass is greener than I remember. Everything is great. I want to share my happiness with my friends, family and the world. I laugh harder than I have ever laughed before. I very rarely wear make-up but when I’m hypomanic I absolutely must. I’m confident in every aspect of life. I even love going to work. I have the best ideas. I could definitely do that. My taste in music changes I’m forever searching for an up-beat song that has a fast beat that I can sing to, dance to. I’ll skip 100’s of songs until I find the one and when I do it’s AMAZING.</p><p>In social situations during a hypomanic episode you’ll often find me surrounded by people. I love talking and I love listening. People tend to be really drawn to me when I’m like this because I’m fun to be around and I make them laugh. I often go days with barely any sleep. I don’t need it. I don’t need to eat either.&nbsp; I can sleep when I’m dead, eating is a distraction from what I want to be doing and I have lots of things that I want to do. Sounds great right? How is this even considered a mental illness? Let me tell you… During this episodes one of my symptoms is hypersexuality.</p><blockquote><p><span><strong>Hypersexuality</strong></span> is defined as an increased need or pressure for sexual gratification. It can often be a symptom of mania, and may also include decreased inhibitions or a need for forbidden sex.</p></blockquote><p>For me I become preoccupied with the thought of having sex and I’ll pursue someone hard. Not just with my partner at the time but anyone who takes my eye. In fact, I don’t even need to feel that attracted to them. The thrill of flirting, the thrill of making them want me is my objective. I consider myself a straight female (Though I have had sexual encounters with women in the past) but it doesn’t matter. I’ll flirt and have sex with women too. I don’t want or need it to be intimate. It’s an hedonistic, animalistic desire to have sex. And if I don’t get it? It pisses me off. This again probably doesn’t sound like the end of the world does it? But what if you’re flirting and perusing your boss? A married man or you’re in a relationship yourself? Not so funny when it can fuck up your life and other peoples. </p><p>This behaviour has led me into dangerous situations. I have been sexually assaulted numerous times and now what would be defined as rape. At the time I had no awareness that it was. For this reason amongst others I never reported it. Victim blaming is prevelant in society. I saw it as me putting myself in a&nbsp; situation where it could happen, thus it was my own fault.</p><p>Reflecting on my teenage years I can now really see that hypomania was very present. After my dad died when I was 16. I stopped turning up at school I made friends with people much older than me. Many of them I’m still friends with and they really are great friends.&nbsp; But during this period of my life I ended up using recreational drugs EVERY weekend, ALL weekend.&nbsp; Not just a bit of weed but ecstasy and cocaine whilst drinking heavily too. Sometimes I took all of those drugs on the same night. I remember the day I turned 18. Finishing work, the guy I worked with (also my best friend at the time) handed me some money to buy ecstasy for the party were planning to have. I walked into my Mum’s house filled with family there to wish me happy birthday. I stood there and chatted to them, the whole time I had 200 ecstasy tablets in the front pocket of my hoody. I didn’t care. I didn’t care that taking one of those ecstasy tablets could have killed me. Because it wouldn’t would it? I’m indestructible. I’m having so much fun. Life is great.</p><p>If all that hasn’t persuaded you that hypomania is a bad thing… What about the racing thoughts? The irritation that consumes you and the full-blown anger that comes because of it? I’ve lost friends and I’ve upset people because something relatively minor has pissed me off and I have completely lost self-control. I can’t control what comes out of my mouth, I don’t have the restraint or the ability to filter what I say. I’ve thrown things, I’ve smashed things. I’ve screamed, caught my breath and screamed again.&nbsp; I’ve promised to do impossible tasks. I’ve spent money I didn’t have because I wanted, no needed those clothes,shoes and that new laptop. I have at least 15 bottles of shampoo in my bathroom, drawers full of make-up all that I very rarely use. The result of a hypomanic episode.</p><p>During some episodes the “fun bit” hasn’t come. Sometimes hypomania for me has had more psychotic and paranoid features such as hearing voices talking about me. My anxiety increases beyond its normal threshold to the point I have panic attacks. I can feel my heart beating so fast that it feels like it’s going to come out of my chest. I shake uncontrollably. And have lost control of my bladder. Yes I’ve actualIy pissed myself fully clothed where I stand. I can actually see my thoughts swirling around above my head so fast that they I can barely read them. I’ve found myself putting my hands over my head and squeezing just to get some sort of relief. Hypomania at some points has led to me trying to, or wanting to kill myself. Not so fun now is it? It’s hard not to get addicted to the euphoria of hypomania. I try to remind myself that there are very real consequences to these episodes when I consider not taking my medication just to feel that euphoria again.</p><p>When it’s all over I’m left to pick up the pieces, to fix (if they are even fixable) the stupid shit I’ve done. Hypomania isn’t fun when it’s over. The depression that comes after hypomania is possibly the worst type of depression. My mind is broken and so is my body. The embarrassment of my behaviour after some of these episodes is awful. I sink lower and lower after every hypomanic episode and it scares me that one day I will really hit the bottom of rock bottom and I’ll never get back out of it. Some of the worst things that have ever happened to me are the result of a hypomanic episode. I’m lucky I’m not dead. Seriously.</p><p>Fortunately, with a combination of medication, psychiatric help and maturing as a person dealing with the depression and hypomania has become easier and I can most of the time diffuse situations or at least deal with the fallout from them better than I have before. &nbsp;Taking diazepam for 7 days at the start of a developing hypomanic episode is necessity for me and can often stop it in its tracks.</p><p>The biggest thing I have learnt after having Bi-Polar is that <span><strong>SLEEP</strong> </span>and <span><strong>STRESS</strong></span> management are key to staying well. When one of those tips the balance, that’s when things start going wrong.</p><p>Although the original idea for this blog was meant to be cathartic release for me. I hope that in some way I can give people a platform to express themselves and the opportunity just to “get it all out” and I hope you feel less alone when reading my posts. Please feel free to engage with me on one of my various social media accounts. Even if it’s just to say Hi or tell me your story.</p><p><img src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" data-src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" alt="" width="160" height="76"></p></div>

		<p>I was on <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/zombie-animals-encounters-terrifying-creatures-rise-42966">Inside Edition last week to talk about zombies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a weird sentence to type.</p>
<p>While the story was dramatic, television clips are notoriously difficult to discuss anything of real significance. I had two main messages I wanted to get across.<strong> One</strong>, that we can’t be sure what these animals are suffering from just by appearance (this message kind of got missed in the clips they chose) and because of that, message <strong>two</strong>: you shouldn’t approach a potentially diseased animal yourself, but instead call animal control or your local wildlife professionals to come help (at least they did include me saying not to approach these animals).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lGACWoZL0-PNLWs0LGJsYz8XoSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHSNF332IQZR5MZDXT5VKCWWTA.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="410"><figcaption>A “zombie” raccoon, probably infected with canine distemper virus. Photo by Robert Coggeshall.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all likelihood, most of the animals they showed and that have been recently been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/zombie-raccoons-are-terrorizing-city-youngstown-ohio-180968704/">“terrorizing” individuals in Youngstown, Ohio</a> are suffering from infection with <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Distemper.aspx">canine distemper virus</a>. This is a virus related to human measles, and like measles, is very contagious. From the name, it obviously affects dogs, but isn’t limited to only dogs. It can also infect raccoons, foxes, opossums, ferrets, and even wild <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/canine-distemper-could-wipe-out-siberian-tigers/">tigers</a>. Among animals, the distemper virus can be transmitted by bites or simple close contact, so it can spread quickly within groups of animals living together. The infected animals then either recover and develop immunity, or pass away from the infection.</p>
<p>The animals exhibiting “zombie” symptoms like those shown in the clip are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s likely that many other animals in the local population are also ill, but perhaps not dramatically so; like any infectious disease, there will be a spectrum of symptoms in infected individuals, so not every wild animal infected with canine distemper will “go zombie.”</p>
<p>Wildlife authorities have noted that these outbreaks of animals acting like “zombies” happen every few years: the virus will sweep through a population lacking <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unforgiving-math-that-stops-epidemics-20171026/">herd immunity</a>, infect many of the individuals, and those who are infected but recover will be immune. A few years later, when the population again contains large numbers of susceptible individuals due to births of new animals, the virus can again cause an outbreak—and the cycle continues over and over.</p>
<p>While canine distemper infection doesn’t cause symptoms in humans, <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/rabies.aspx">rabies absolutely does</a>—and that’s a key reason people need to avoid these animals and leave them to the professionals. Based on the symptoms alone, you can’t tell if an aggressive, strangely-behaving animal is suffering from distemper or rabies. And while distemper isn’t harmful to humans (though it <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/canine-distemper#1">definitely could be to your dog</a> if they’re not up-to-date on their vaccinations), rabies is almost 100% fatal if not quickly treated with anti-rabies immunoglobulin and prophylactic vaccination. In the rare cases who have survived after symptoms developed, it was only with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm">extreme interventions</a> which are <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/six-year-old-dies-rabies-after-experimental-treatment-milwaukee-protocol-fails-782168">not always able to be replicated</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to see these epidemics of “zombie animals” on a regular basis in different locations around the country—but don’t try to be a hero. That never turns out well in the movies.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_322570"><p>The Dodo – endemic to Mauritius, made extinct at some unknown point in the late 1600s (Roberts &amp; Solow 2003, Hume <em>et al</em>. 2004, Cheke 2006) – was a giant, flightless pigeon, closely related to Nicobar pigeons (<em>Caloenas</em>) and crowned pigeons (<em>Goura</em>). This affinity is demonstrated by numerous anatomical details (Fjeldså 1976, Janoo 1996, 2000, Livezey &amp; Zusi 2007, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and also by genetics (Shapiro <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2007). Just knowing about the Dodo’s affinities is useful, since there are a few aspects of Dodo anatomy where we can look to its extant relatives for guidance. Example: obvious sexual dimorphism in plumage (at least, visible to the human eye) is not present in those close living relatives.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_123254"><div>

Supposedly based on a live bird kept in Holland, it’s today at the Natural History Museum, London (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Incidentally, we’re not <em>completely</em> sure that Savery really was the creator of this painting but I will – from hereon – assume that he was for the sake of convenience. A second very famous Savery Dodo painting – this time by Roelandt’s nephew, Jan or Hans Savery – is on show at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and might have been produced in 1631. Regardless, all of these ‘Savery’ Dodo paintings show grey (though read on), chunky, exceedingly bulky, short-legged birds with yellowish wing and tail plumes.</p><p>Despite claims that R. Savery’s 1626 painting was produced from life, it doesn’t match other images which more certainly were and it seems likely that it was based on taxiderm specimens or written accounts. For these reasons it (and other ‘Savery Dodos’) can’t and shouldn’t be taken as providing especially important insights into Dodo appearance or anatomy.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_187214"><div>

The drawings depict both a dead or stunned Dodo laid out on a table as well as one or more live Dodos in standing pose (Kitchener 1993a, Hume 2003, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Another Dodo drawing from the early days of Mauritian discovery and exploration is that featured in the Dutch volume <em>Het Tvveede Boeck</em> of 1601. This reported a 1598 expedition led by Admiral Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, Hume 2006, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and hence the Dodo featured therein has often been called the Van Neck Dodo. A very influential illustration and account produced by the French naturalist Carolus Clusius in 1605 – it will be referred to a few times in this article – was apparently copied from a drawing in Van Neck’s journal, but the original has been lost.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_43525"><div>

An interesting colour painting produced by Cornelis Saftleven in around 1638 has an air of realism which forces writers like myself to pay attention to it (this might be a trick and it could be worthless), and it also gets mention here.

Mansur illustrated animals for Emperor Jahangir of the Mughul Empire who kept a menagerie at Surat, India; Jahangir’s scientific curiosity led him to order the creation of technically rigorous works which were meant to be as accurate and detailed as possible (Dissanayake 2004). As we’ll see, Mansur’s Dodo is one of the most significant depictions of the species in life. And, yes, it seemingly means that at least one live Dodo was present in an Indian menagerie during the 1620s.</p><p>The Dodos of Van Neck, Clusius and Savery are essentially the ‘originals’ from which virtually all later Dodos were copied, and both Kitchener (1993a) and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish (2013)</span></a> produced genealogies showing how subsequent artists based their Dodos on those of these artists.

Peters sees stuff that no-one else can see, reports findings that no-one else finds, perpetually declares everyone else to be wrong, is vastly prolific, and has been very, very good at sharing and disseminating his stuff online. If Peters were reliable, trustworthy, careful, conscientious, and good at doing science, this would be great, and he would be a significant force for good. </p><p>But Peters is not reliable, or careful, or conscientious, or good at doing science. He is the opposite of those things. And yet he’s on a crusade whereby he aims to share his views – proclaimed by him as representing The Truth – as widely and frequently as possible, all the while decrying the mainstream palaeontological world as if it’s part of a conspiratorial cabal of blinkered elites. Peters is a significant source of miseducation, whose work floods the internet, and who aims to bamboozle those unaware that he’s peddling nonsense.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_546745"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_35989"><p>But at some point between the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became clear from his online writings and published articles that Peters had become <em>very strange</em>. Thanks to a unique kind of magic, super-powered vision, he claimed to find hitherto undetected babies, soft-tissue frills, umpteen new anatomical structures <em>and more</em> on pterosaur fossils. These claims were awfully reminiscent of those fringe announcements on the finding of skulls and bits of technology in NASA’s photographs of Mars or the moon, or of Jon-Eric ‘the fruitbat’ Beckjord’s proposals that frames of the Patterson-Gimlin film reveal hidden Bigfoots lurking in the shadows. Today, the Peters of 2020 thinks that at least some of these claims – documented in Peters (2004) and reported at conferences (e.g., the 2003 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting at San Antonio, Texas, the 2006 Flugsaurier meeting at Munich) – should be ignored as “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”. Making mistakes is part of science, we all do it. But claiming with confidence (in print and at conferences) that you’ve found a ton of incredible stuff that others have not is a red flag, especially when the Peters technique of finding stuff that on-one else can has the vile, distinct stench of pseudoscience about it. And despite arguments that those weird claims of the past were “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”, the fact is that Peters has never stopped doing whatever it is that he does.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_41793"><div>

By now, the proverbial cat (a vampire cat, covered in hitherto unseen babies and sporting a <em>Longisquama</em>-like frill of dorsal plumes and with a previously unnoticed long, tassel-tipped tail) was out of the bag, and it became less easy – although not impossible – for Peters to get his stuff into the literature, and presented at conferences. Several of his manuscripts – I believe submitted to such journals as <em>Nature</em> and <em>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</em> and mostly aimed at tackling big picture issues of reptile phylogeny – were rejected at around this time (for the record, I have not ever, not once, acted as a reviewer for a Peters paper).</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_203035"><div>

He stepped up his game online, giving us the outpouring that is ReptileEvolution.com and the updated daily, twice daily, thrice daily, infinity-times daily blog The Pterosaur Heresies. Though starting this grand online project with pterosaurs as his focus, Peters has expanded his interest to include reptiles of all sorts, mammals, all tetrapods and FISH as well. To those mammal, bird and fish experts who didn’t care about Peters when he was just ‘that weird pterosaur guy’, I say… well, now you know what it’s like.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_92439"><div>

Or, restated: why can’t I just mind my own business and leave Peters alone? I will tell you why. If ‘the published literature’ is regarded as a synonym for ‘the accepted canon of human knowledge’, then efforts to curtail the spread of Peters’ ideas (e.g., <a href="http://bigcat.fhsu.edu/biology/cbennett/Bennett-PT-article.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Bennett 2005</span></a>) have been successful. His efforts to instigate paradigm change (that pterosaurs are lepidosaurs, that mammals are archosauromorph reptiles, that bats are civets, that mysticete whales are desmostylians and so on and on and on and on) have failed and are being ignored by working scientists. </p><p>If, however, you think that material shared online – in blog articles and so on – has some impact on what people think worthy of attention or allocation to memory, Peters is successful. Peters is not, dear reader, just doing his own thing in some quiet corner of the internet, beavering away in earnest, minding his own business. He is instead on some kind of eternal crusade to promote promote promote his ideas CEASELESSLY. I can confirm from working with students, the interested public and even other qualified scientists that his stuff is often assumed to be real science, on equal footing with that of those he criticises. All of which means that his efforts need countering. </p><p>My interest in the dissemination of knowledge and public education, and my respect for the due diligence of those people whose work is criticised, admonished or …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div>

<h2 id="about-rengine">About reNgine</h2>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17223002/86880620-92814300-c10a-11ea-9b27-627f43934221.png" alt=""></p>

<p>reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework meant for information gathering during penetration testing of web applications. reNgine has customizable scan engines, which can be used to scan the domains, endpoints, or gather information. The beauty of reNgine is that it gathers everything in one place. It has a pipeline of reconnaissance, which is highly customizable.</p>

<p>reNgine can be very useful when you want to perform the reconnaissance, gather endpoints, directory and file search, grab screenshots, and gather all the results in one place.</p>

<p>Suppose, if you have a domain hackerone.com, reNgine can perform the scan based on your scan engines, gather all the results in one place. reNgine makes it possible for use cases like, “I want to search the subdomain which has page title “Dashboard” and has page status as 200, and I quickly want to have a look at the screenshot”.</p>

<p>Another use-case could be, “I want to list all subdomains that use PHP, and the HTTP status is 200!”</p>

<p>On the endpoints part, reNgine is capable of gathering the URL endpoints using tools like <code>gau</code>, <code>hakrawler</code> which gathers URL from many sources like common crawl, Wayback engine, etc.</p>

<p>reNgine also makes it possible for the use case like, “search the URLs that have extension .php and HTTP status is 200!”</p>

<p><strong>Suppose if you are looking for open redirection, you can quickly search for <code>=http</code> and look for HTTP status 30X, this will give high accuracy of open redirection with minimal efforts.</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-it-is-not">What it is not</h3>

<p>reNgine is not a:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vulnerability scanner!</li>
  <li>Reconnaissance with high accuracy (No! reNgine, uses other open-source tools, to make this pipeline possible. The accuracy and capability of reNgine is also dependent on those tools)</li>
  <li>Speed oriented recon framework with immediate results</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17223002/86508685-ba696180-bdff-11ea-9def-f45e5b059f0f.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, at this point, reNgine does not give the best of the best result compared to other tools, but reNgine has certainly minimal efforts. Also, I am continuously adding new features. You may help me on this journey by creating a PR filled with new features and bug fixes. Please have a look at the <a href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section before doing so.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine.git
<span>cd </span>rengine
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Docker
    <ul>
      <li>Install docker based on your OS from <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>docker-compose
    <ul>
      <li>Installation instructions for docker-compose from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Assuming that you have followed the above steps and inside rengine directory</p>
<div><div><pre><code>docker-compose up <span>--build</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The build process may take some time.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you also can run the project with pre-built Docker images (with 2FA enabled, you have to <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">create a new personal access token</a> with <code>read:packages</code> scope):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker login docker.pkg.github.com
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the setup is done, you need to setup the password.</p>

<h3 id="register-account">Register Account</h3>

<p>Once the application is up and running, you need an account for reNgine. This can be easily created using <code>createsuperuser</code> from Django.
Open a new terminal tab, and run the following command:</p>

<p><code>docker exec -it rengine_web_1 python manage.py createsuperuser</code></p>

<p>You may now enter your username and password. Remember to keep a secure password.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>:warning: reNgine does fingerprinting, port scanning, and banner grabbing, which might be illegal in some countries. Please make sure you are authorized to perform reconnaissance on the targeted domain before using this tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the installation is successful, then you can run reNgine by using the command</p>


<p>The web application can then be accessed from <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a></p>

<h2 id="vps-https-installation">VPS HTTPS Installation</h2>

<p>If you are considering to install on VPS with https, here is an awesome blog written by @J0_mart <a href="https://www.jomar.fr/posts/2020/07/en-install-rengine-with-nginx-and-ssl-auto-renew/">https://www.jomar.fr/posts/2020/07/en-install-rengine-with-nginx-and-ssl-auto-renew/</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                
                    <p>Accidents, tragedies, or negative outcomes, all entice a usual reaction: whoâ€™s at fault for this? Who is to blame? Our instinct drives us in that direction. The reasoning seems pretty obvious: if something bad has happened, it must have been because of someone screwed up by being negligent or maybe they were malevolent all along.</p>

<p>However, sometimes thereâ€™s no one we should be blaming. If we think in calm and measured wayâ€”before scapegoatingâ€”it becomes obvious that no oneâ€™s guilty.</p>

<p>I recently saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUCfY270l7k">video of killing</a> of Haramabe, a silverback gorilla, by Cincinnati Zoo authorities. The video shows a disoriented, agitated gorilla dragging a toddlerâ€”who had fallen into the enclosure after climbing the 3-foot fenceâ€”with intense force. After deliberating for ten minutes, the Zoo authorities decided to shoot the gorilla. Silverback gorilla is an endangered specie and Harambe was only half-way through his expected lifespan. Naturally, the action invited a ton of angry reactions.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s to blame?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the zoo authorities. They point out that Harambe wasnâ€™t trying to hurt the child, and a tranquilizer could have been employed instead. The other camp questions the negligence of having a miniature fence.</li>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the parents (the mother here). For letting the kid out of sight. Many, including prominent stars like Ricky Gervais, have targeted the mother for being an awful parent.</li>
  <li>The more misopedic ones blame the toddler and even question the decision of prioritizing a human life over the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>But thereâ€™s no one to blame if you ascertain all the facts of the case.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Silverback Gorillas are extremely powerful. It could be argued that Harambe didnâ€™t intend to harm the child, but even without effort, Harambe couldâ€™ve seriously hurt him. He was visibly getting more and more upset by the commotion.</li>
  <li>Tranquilizer darts take about ten minutes to work. The gorilla could have potentially injured the child in that time window, especially after being shot at.</li>
  <li>The fence could have been taller, but that only became obvious after the fact. The fence was erected in 1978 and they had no incident of visitors crossing till 2016. Additionally, the zoo passed inspections without being cited even once for the fenceâ€™s height.</li>
  <li>The mother had four kids with her. The toddler skipped fence when she was strapping the other kids to the stroller. Kids, especially if youâ€™ve multiple, canâ€™t be watched 24x7.  Parents are humans, not robots, and they have limited attention span. The fence climbing could have happened in a 10-20 sec window while she was focused on her other kids. (<a href="https://people.com/celebrity/witness-describes-moment-when-4-year-old-climbed-into-gorilla-enclosure/">ref</a>)</li>
  <li>Finally, kids that young are still impervious to dangers of their actions. They are still learning about the world and can unknowingly attempt something very perilous.</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, thereâ€™s no one to blame. It just an unfortunate incident that happened with no one at an obvious fault. You could invoke the moral culpability in keeping animals away from their natural habitat, but that is far removed from the incident.</p>

<hr>

<p>In 2009, Gene Weingarten, touched on a similar subject with his Pulitzer winning story, â€œ<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html">Fatal Distraction</a>.â€� Around 15-25 times a year, a parentâ€”an â€œotherwise loving and attentive parentâ€�â€”forgets a child in the carâ€™s backseat resulting in a tragic death. Such a horrifying mistake would register as  gross neglect to must of us, but we should ask, can our disgust be more than the â€œlifelong sentence of guiltâ€� that the parent has to bear? This isnâ€™t wilful negligence, itâ€™s a mistake like any other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memory is a machine, and it is not flawless. Our conscious mind prioritizes things by importance, but on a cellular level, our memory does not. <strong>If youâ€™re capable of forgetting your cellphone, you are potentially capable of forgetting your child</strong></p>

  <p><em>â€”  David Diamond, professor of molecular physiology, University of South Florida</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The search to blame someone can actually exacerbate the situation as Margarethe Wiersema, professor of management at University of California, observed in her <a href="https://hbr.org/2002/12/holes-at-the-top-why-ceo-firings-backfire">study of CEO firings</a>. Often, because of poor earnings and growth, the board of directors relent under the pressure and dismiss the CEO. However, having a new head doesnâ€™t translate to a turnaround; in fact, the decline could potentially accelerate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typically a CEO gets fired not because the board has thoughtfully and deliberately concluded that itâ€™s time for a change at the top but because investors, concerned about poor performance, demand a change. Board members, who have little idea how to address the underlying problems that got their company into trouble in the first place, seek to appease investors in the short term by handing them the CEOâ€™s head on a platter.</p>

  <p>â€¦</p>

  <p>Company performance relative to industry average failed to improve significantly after bringing in a new CEO. And performance lagged behind that of companies with routine CEO successions. I couldnâ€™t find a single measure suggesting that CEO dismissals have a positive effect on corporate performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism">politicianâ€™s syllogism</a> at work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We must do something</li>
  <li>This is something</li>
  <li>Therefore, we must do this.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Rather than asking whoâ€™s to blame, the more productive thing is to assess a situation from everyoneâ€™s point of view, understand that humans are fallible, and think what we can do improve the future outcomes. Blame is an easy game, but compassion is harder.</p>

<h4>Gout termed as rich man’s disease caused a significant impact in Europe and US&nbsp;history.</h4>

<p>The king of the Holy Roman Empire laid siege on the city of Metz in France. The blockade would have been an instant victory if the king had barged into the city. Severe pain in his feet delayed the king to start an offensive. The delay caused the king to lose the battle. The entire European monarchy crashed with it. The Kings’s pain was due to a disease that impacted European history for years to come. The condition was Gout, also called as Foot grabber.</p>



<p>Gout has been part of the royal disease list for centuries. Gout is inflammation in bone joints and termed as the Arthritis of the rich. Gout has affected a meager portion of the world population but has influenced some of the world’s significant political events. Gout occurs due to excessive meat and alcohol consumption, which is the trademark of Europe’s aristocratic life. Gout is mostly formed in the feet and caused unbearable pain.</p>



<h4>Charles V’s Gout Problem and Fall of&nbsp;Europe:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/00cf6-0pfleiado4dmcexib.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Charles V.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles V was the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and waged war against the French and led a successful crusade. During one of his campaigns, Charles V laid siege on the crucial town of Metz in France. Metz was the last major town in French control. Charles V had the habit of exhaustive drinking and meat consumption due to which Gout developed in his leg. On the siege day due to unbearable Gout pain, Charles V stopped the offensive and took rest. During the period of rest, the French reinforced the town. When he recovered and went for an invasion, Charles V lost the battle. After the loss and due to Gout pain Charles V abdicated the throne and split the Holy Roman Empire among his son and brother. Gout brought in the Holy Roman Empire’s downfall and cut Europe into two factions the Spanish Habsburgs and Austrian Habsburgs.</p>

<h4>William Pitt, the Elder, and US Independence:</h4>

<p>William Pitt, the Elder, was a British parliamentarian who influenced the British parliament. He was the grandson of the famous Thomas Diamond Pitt. William had Gout from a young age and skipped college graduation due to it. William Pitt spoke for the rights of the people in the American colony. When the British parliament voted on imposing taxes on tea, William Pitt spoke against the bill. He convinced many members to vote against the law. Unfortunately, on the final day of the debate, William could not attend the session, which passed the tax bill.<br>The high tax on tea created the Boston tea party and ultimately sown the seeds for the American revolution. Had Gout not caught William that day, American independence would not have happened.</p>



<p>Other famous personalities who had Gout are Cosmo de Medici, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry VIII.</p>



<p>Physicians came up with remedies to the Gout issue with stool or glass boot, but the relief was temporary. Gout got its portrayal as a rich man’s disease due to its patient history.</p>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Last Sunday the 19th July 2020 I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>, a Decentralised, Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like microBlogging Platform.</p>

<p>You can read about my previous <a href="https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/20/ann-announcing-twtxtnet.html">Announcing twtxt.net post</a>.</p>

<p>Today however I want to share more about <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> and the software behind it <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a>; Why I’ve done all this, Why it is important to me and Why you should care.</p>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background Story</h2>

<p>So before we go into the Why and How, let’s first of all talk about how we go here in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in ~2015 I got head hunted by <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>™ and after turning them down twice (<em>three was a bit much!</em>) I accepted the offer and relocated my family to the Bay Area at the Menlo Park HQ ala Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>There I spent ~3.5yrs as a Production Engineer (<em>Google it, or think DevOps/SRE if you’re unfamiliar, but not an apt description</em>).
Meanwhile, while I was <em>trying</em> to be good at my new found ay job, interesting developments were happening in the Social Media industry. Not only was Facebook copping flack for the Cambridge Analytics series of events, but <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>™ was going through some changes as well…</p>

<p>Twitter (_allegedly, although I never really got into Twitter myself…)( was introducing new automated algorithms to change what users on their platform saw on their timeline. This has significant impact on usability of the original intended use of the platform. Naturally <em>some</em> users did not like this and sought out other avenues and solutinos.</p>

<p>One such avenue was <a href="https://github.com/bucket">bucket</a>’s <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a>. As I understand it he created a very simple file format specification, a canonical client and unleashed this onto the world! 👏</p>

<p>This was all around ~2016. I was too busy at Facebook to notice :)</p>

<h2 id="present-day-2020">Present Day (2020)</h2>

<p>Fast forward to ~2020 (<em>20th July 2020 to be exact</em>) and a few weeks earlier while I was on holidays I was up late one night just poking around on the Internet (<em>as you do</em>) and looking for “Decentralized Social Media” software. I found quite a few; here are some of the better known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other not so well known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU Social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This this very blog’s underlying platform <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> where I now write and publish longer pieces like on my <a href="https://prologic.blog/">Blog</a></p>

<p>There’s even an article on Wired entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/">Decentralised Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>! Well I’m here to tell you  I formally challenge this and am here to throw the gauntlet down! 🧤</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way… I <em>might</em> have caught twtxt sooner back in ~2018 when I got back from the US, but I was also (<em>at that time</em>) too busy moving around, working and trying to get bak into our family home that was still being rented at the time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I said I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>the first of what I hope will be many instances</em>) on Sunday the 19th July 2020. I wrote the software <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a> in just a few short weekends in my “spare time” and licensed it under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<p>📕 If you haven’t already checked it out, created an account and played around. I would encourage you to do so! I run a freely available for anyone to use instance over at <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are non-technical and read this far… Firstly congratulations I like you already! Second, don’t worry, <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is just a platform to voice/share your thoughts, wisdoms, rambling, short-form text or anything else you want. Think of it like a miniature Facebook or Twitter but without all the advertising or tracking.</p>

<p>I believe in this very simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a diary and a Parker™ Pen.
If you then write down your thoughts, wisdoms, experiences, rambling or whatever you want to and share this with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who owns what you have written? The manufacturer of the paper? The manufacturer of the diary? The manufacturer of the pen?</p>

<h3 id="so-why-why-should-i-use-twtxt-net">So why? Why should I use twtxt.net?</h3>

<p>You should use <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> if you are the type of person that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoys writing and sharing interesting things with others.</li>
<li>Just have interesting things to say in general. Knowledge and Wisdom should be shared!</li>
<li>Are tired of all the issues of all the <strong>BIG</strong> Social Media giants that now plague the f<em>, g</em> and t*.</li>
<li>No longer <em>wish</em> to be the product of Facebook or Twitter and want to <strong>own</strong> your own posts and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See whilst <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is brand spanking new, there are a few principles that will always remain true even now and going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> User behaviour tracking of any kind.</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong> Advertising anywhere  of any kind.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> be capable of being self-hosted.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> allow users to take their data somewhere else and use another <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a> client</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-how-will-you-make-any-money">So how will you make any money?!</h3>

<p>Good question! Glad you asked. I probably won’t! But one of my primary goals is for users to “Self Host”.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well it simply means that you run your own server instance of the software that is behind <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-technical person (<em>which would be true of most people as there are only about ~1M software developers in the world</em>) then you’re probably asking yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do I do this?! I don’t know anything about computers! I just use apps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well don’t worry. Even through (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) it’s really early days for <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> there are plans for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paid single-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> that is <strong>your very own</strong>, personalised to you, with your own domain name but with all the same features.</li>
<li>A paid multi-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> with all the same features but more suitable to small communities, schools, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much will this cost when it becomes available? Short answer is I don’t know. But I can tell you this, it will cost you less than what you are paying for Facebook and Twitter today (<em>remember that even through the f<em>, t</em>, g* are all FREE, there is an implicit cost, which is to say that you are implicitly paying for it as you are their product!</em>).</p>

<p>Let’s just say that once we’re ready to launch single-click hosted instances for the masses that it will cost you next to nothing. And if you can’t pay for your own instance, just use a friend’s instance or jump on any other instance you can find like <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>!</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-today">twtxt.net Today</h2>

<p>So let’s talk about what <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> can do for you today.</p>

<p>Today you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signup as a new user at <a href="https://twtxt.net/register">https://twtxt.net/register</a></li>
<li>Login at <a href="https://twtx.net/login">https://twtx.net/login</a></li>
<li>Make your first post by entering some prose of wisdom in the text box and hitting Submit!</li>
<li>You can follow other feeds by entering a Nickname for the feed and their URL in <a href="https://twtxt.net/follow">https://twtxt.net/follow</a></li>
<li>You can discover other users on the same instance as you by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/discover">https://twtxt.net/discover</a></li>
<li>You can find interesting external feeds and even external users outside of the instance you’re on by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/feeds">https://twtxt.net/feeds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And most of all. You can have engaging, fun and interesting interactions with all sorts of people! <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) is growing at a rate of ~2-3K requests per day and 3-5 new user signups per day. WOW! 😱</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-tomorrow">twtxt.net Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Now there’s still loads more work to do and all of this is happening in “spare time”. No one is paying me or contributors to do any of this. We do this out of the love and kindness of our hearts 💚</p>

<p>Nevertheless progress will continue and here’s what we have planned already:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Native Mobile iPhone / iOS App! 🎉</li>
<li><code>@mentions</code> where you can easily see who has mentioned you in a post (<em>we call them <code>twt</code>s</em>)</li>
<li><code>#hashtag</code> searching where you can see other similar posts that users tag.</li>
<li>Always continuing to improve the UI/UX and overall user experience.</li>
<li>Uploading images/photos! 📷 This will come pretty quickly actually because there is already a demand for this!</li>
<li>Instance&lt;-&gt;Instance interactions. Basically strengthening the first-class decentralised nature of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>. 👌</li>
</ul>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is a <strong>FREE</strong> new type of Social Media that has a strong focus on Self-Hosting, Decentralisation without any of the bloat, tracking or advertising that we’ve all come to take for granted.</p>

Come, follow me down into the realm of gloom.” Goethe, <em>Faust</em></strong></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1939, <em>Minneapolis Journal </em>photographer David Dornberg went on a “Camera Safari,” as he called it, through a large cave under downtown Minneapolis. He described it as “a ‘lost world,’ weird and spooky—the darkest spot for adventure into which my four years as a Journal cameraman ever led me.” Some may discount this as sensationalistic tripe, but read the testimony of Roger Kehret, a seasoned Minnesota caver with years of experience, in his 1974 booklet, <em>Minnesota Caves of History and Legend</em>: “When cavers think of remote hard to reach caves it brings to mind scenes of high mountains of the Pacific Northwest or the steaming jungles of the Amazon. The most remote and hard to get to cave that I have ever reached is found on Fourth Street near Marquette Avenue in down town Minneapolis, Minnesota.” This chapter describes my own ordeal to reach this lost world.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave, as it has become known among urban explorers, has also been called “Loop Cave,” “Manhole Cave,” or “Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank Cave.” It got the name from Schieks Palace Royale, a gentlemen’s club that now occupies the Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank building, under which the cave is located. Journalist Kay Miller once described the nightclub as “topless above, bottomless below” because of the underlying cave, but there’s no humanly enterable physical connection between them.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave is the largest natural cave under downtown Minneapolis, extending for a city block through the St. Peter Sandstone. Carl J. Illstrup, city sewer engineer, who discovered the cave in 1904, described it as a “cave shaped like an inverted bowl,” a description that seems puzzling to anyone who has actually been there. (It’s shaped more like a pancake that has gone awry on the griddle, if that helps.) In 1931, an enthusiastic journalist, Fitzsimmons, waxed poetical about “the beauties of the sewer system” and described Illstrup as “the ruler of this fantastic world.” The discovery of the cave in 1904, during which the crews braved “the lethal breath of deadly gases,” is presented as the highpoint of Illstrup’s life.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest known documentation of Schieks Cave is the 1904 Lund survey, which is good for showing the former “creeks” and “lakes” of the cave. Reportedly, the cave was kept a secret for years because city officials feared the public would think downtown Minneapolis was built on a thin shell that would plunge into a hole in the earth. Another concern was that burglars might have worked undetected and bored directly into the bank’s treasure vaults. By 1921 it was reported that “The entire business portion of the city is built over a series of subterranean lakes and caverns as mysterious and baffling as the Mammoth caves of Kentucky or catacombs of Rome.” The 1929 Lawton survey depicts the cave extensively modified by the construction of piers, walls, and artificial drainage systems. It also shows the 75-foot entrance shaft on Fourth Street and the 15-foot shaft from the cave to the underlying North Minneapolis Tunnel, a sanitary sewer.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;"><img src="http://gregbrick.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg" alt="1939 Dornberg map" width="738" height="631" data-mce-src="/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg"></span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1952 the Twin Cities Grotto, local chapter of the National Speleological Society, visited Schieks Cave, and it was written up for the Sunday supplements. The late architectural historian David Gebhard, author of many architectural guidebooks, was a member of this club. In 1983, a successor organization, the Minnesota Speleological Survey (MSS), visited the cave, and their lurid account of the gloomy cave whose walls were black with cockroaches, and the roaring sewer that ran under it, only fired my enthusiasm to get there someday—one way or another. Perhaps even by climbing up from the sewers rather than down from the streets?</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest published account of someone visiting Schieks Cave without official sanction has been quoted above. In a chapter titled, “The Minnesota Rovers Great Manhole Cave Expedition,” Kehret went on to reveal how the Rovers, an outing club, dressed as sewer workers, surrounded the entrance manhole with barricades, and used a truck-mounted winch to remove the heavy, hexagonal lid (which in recent years has been welded shut). Getting there must have been more than half the fun, however, because Kehret said little about the cave itself, except that it was “almost filled with sand, concrete, pipes and other debris.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1993, John and I examined the storm drains under the Minneapolis loop with the hope of getting into Schieks Cave. Located far below street level, the system drains to the Mississippi River by a large outfall in the milling district. With reference to the most famous sewer of Antiquity, it’s the very “Cloaca Maxima” of Minneapolis. Because no connection from the storm drains to the cave, or to the sanitary sewer known to run under the cave, was found, we shelved the project. Shortly thereafter I left for the University of Connecticut, where I did graduate work on barite mines.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1996 a college student, along with several friends, began a series of attempts to get to Schieks Cave. He created a website, perhaps the first of its kind in this area, called “Minneapolis Draining Archive,” where he posted trip reports of these and other adventures. After exploring the storm drains without result, he tried wading upstream in the North Minneapolis Tunnel (NMT). This sanitary sewer, eight feet in diameter, carries the great river of human waste from the Loop, and runs directly under the cave, as noted above.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">NMT is the very gut of Minneapolis. Wading upstream is fatiguing owing to the swift, chest-deep current (2.5 feet per second), and the well-lubricated invert (floor). Occasionally one of them would lose his footing, even to the extent of full immersion in the warm, gray fluid, and get swept back to the starting point. He persevered to the extent of going two city blocks, with four blocks remaining to get to the cave. In desperation, he considered driving climbing pitons into the sewer walls, but nothing came of it. While NMT has been called a lot of things over the years, my favorite was the “Silk Road,” an allusion, you might imagine, to all the little bits of toilet tissue swirling through there. It took an effort to maintain a sense of humor in such grim surroundings.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1999,<em> National Geographic Adventure</em> magazine commissioned a writer to report on urban exploration, which came to focus on the efforts to get to Schieks Cave. By this time I had met him and we agreed to join forces. I advocated an “upstream strategy”: to find a safe entrance to NMT upstream from the cave and “go with the flow,” rather than buck the current. The summer of 1999 was devoted to this task. In keeping with the magazine’s hip, youthful, target audience, however, my critical role in the exploration, without which it would not have succeeded, was to be downgraded to that of a “wizened elder” who “smokes cheap cigars.” All the locations appearing in the photo shoot, for example, were picked by me, and I was the only person who knew how to access them. But I was in my thirties at the time, a bit too long in the tooth for their demographic. By contrast, the youthful explorer was compared with world-renowned physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, apparently for things like crafting a make-shift sewer canoe out of “an old file cabinet.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The first upstream entry point we investigated was the venerable Bassett Creek Tunnel. Running below this storm tunnel for a short distance was a sanitary sewer, the whole thing forming somewhat of a double-decker arrangement. The plan was to drop into the lower tunnel and head downstream to the cave. But upon removing the lids in the floor of the upper tunnel, and allowing the mephitic vapors to exhale, we got cold feet. The sewage just seemed to be moving too fast down there.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">More to be feared, however, was the inferred existence of a waterfall at some point along the sewer line. While at Bassett Creek the sanitary sewer was somewhat near street level, at Schieks Cave, NMT is 90 feet down. Somewhere along the way there had to be a big drop. And the small-scale sewer maps that we had didn’t indicate details of this nature.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Tracing the sanitary sewer downstream by peeping through the holes on manhole lids, we found a “good lid” farther along, on a little used side street. The sewage was not moving so fast here, but it appeared deeper. Surrounding the manhole with orange cones, we descended a rope ladder and walked downstream. My thigh waders soon overtopped and filled with sewage, so that I appeared to have elephantiasis. Condoms, distended with raw sewage, dangled from the vaults above our heads. The hypothetical waterfall, located near Déjà Vu Nightclub, proved very real. Affixing a safety line to a pipe jutting from the walls, we approached the slippery brink of the cataract and peered into the abyss. I recalled the ending of Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</em>, where a chasm opened to swallow the hapless explorers.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">This sanitary waterfall marked the beginning of the deep NMT proper. From here, NMT ran under Schieks Cave and then on towards the treatment plant. We saw ladder rungs in the wall of the dropshaft, in the midst of the waterfall. We briefly toyed with the notion of sealing ourselves in trash bags, diverting the waterfall, and descending the ladder, but it all seemed just a bit too weird. Such situations are dangerous for another reason, namely, that the turbulence of the splattering sewage causes deadly gasses to bubble off. We gave up on that approach.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In August, 1999, we investigated another tributary of NMT, running under the warehouse district. We found good lids situated among deserted construction sites, but here again we faced the daunting prospect of a waterfall. Soon after, the young explorer returned to the manhole with his buddies, descended into the tributary on a …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>

<p>With a physical device you can create a <strong>logical device</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical devices represent the GPU, and logical devices are what you use to create resources and access <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<p>Keeping the logical device separate from the physical device is also useful because it allows you to have multiple logical devices, each with their state and resources, for a single physical device. One example of where this would be useful is if you had a Vulkan rendering application that also used a UI Toolkit (also running on Vulkan) that was completely separate. They’d each need their own logical devices to operate, but they’re both using the same physical device.</p>
<p>Logical device creation is also where you create queues.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Ideally you should reuse command buffers, but generally you can re-record them every frame without a large performance hit, and it makes some things easier (e.g.&nbsp;sending uniform buffers to shaders).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. One reason why this is useful is that it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later).</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for recording to a command buffer and render pass </b></summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>// Create a command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>vk::CommandBuffer cmd;</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span>// Start recording to the command buffer and render pass</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>cmd.begin(vk::CommandBufferBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>// Bind a graphics pipeline (covered later)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>cmd.bindPipeline(vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics, graphicsPipeline);</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a><span>// Bind vertex buffers containing info needed to draw vertices</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>cmd.bindVertexBuffers(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, vertexBuffers, offsets);</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a><span>// Draw the buffer currently bound to this command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>cmd.draw(vertices.size(), <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);</span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>// Stop recording to the render pass and command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-18"><a href="#cb2-18"></a>cmd.endRenderPass();</span>
<span id="cb2-19"><a href="#cb2-19"></a>cmd.end();</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Sync within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Sync between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A common use case for any software product is the ability to run a certain business logic whenever a particular event gets triggered. This event could occur in the form of a webhook fired by a 3rd party service to your server or it could be generated via your product itself. The point being this event triggers a transaction in your system and the loss of even a single transaction is not acceptable.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This seems straightforward enough when dealing with a low rate of such events, but if your server receives these events at the rate of 200 requests per second and each of these events require significant resources for processing them, it is no longer a trivial thing to do.</p><p>We had a similar requirement while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> which is a tool that helps e-commerce merchants notify their customers when orders are confirmed/shipped via WhatsApp. To implement this we register webhooks to receive order lifecycle events whenever a new e-commerce store signs up with our product.&nbsp;</p><p>This did not seem like a big deal at first until we released that if we acquire even a handful of stores that have a very high volume of orders, the number of webhooks we will receive is going to increase exponentially and if we need the product to scale, we would have to queue up the events and process them asynchronously instead of processing it the moment we receive a webhook.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Expectations from a message queue system</strong><br></p><p>There are 4 primary things that are needed if you want to queue up messages and process them asynchronously.</p><p>‍<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: A dashboard where you can view all the current asynchronous jobs and make sure all of them are running smoothly and there is no clog anywhere.</li><li><strong>Error handling</strong>: The ability to retry failed transactions without having to receive the event again.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Zero loss</strong>: None of the events must be lost and must stay in the queue until they are picked up.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: If the volume of messages goes up, handling them should be as simple as adding another worker to the pool.</li></ol><p><strong>Available methods for doing this</strong><br></p><p>The above mentioned problem is not something new and has already been solved in many ways. Here are a few that I am aware of.</p><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">AWS SQS</a> as the queue and AWS Lambda as the handler for the jobs in the queue.</li><li><a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Celery</a> is a great framework that solves exactly this and it has compatibility with AWS SQS, Redis and Rabbit MQ.</li><li><a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">Python-rq</a> with Redis as the queue.</li></ol><p>I immediately ruled out the first method because it would involve too much vendor lock in with AWS and out of the remaining 2 methods, I personally got a little bit spooked by Celerys documentation as it seems a bit overwhelming for my simple use case of being able to deploy worker programs that pick up items from a queue and process them.</p><p>Therefore I decided to <a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">go with python-rq</a> as it was something I had previously tinkered with, so let's go through each of the expectations that I listed earlier and see if python-rq satisfied all of them.</p><p><strong>Monitoring</strong><br></p><p>To quote one of the lines from the python-rq documentation, “Monitoring is where RQ shines”.&nbsp; You get access to a dashboard where you can view jobs that are currently being processed, pending jobs and failed jobs.</p><figure id="w-node-2f944d69418b-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765a977f73edea652de_BbkLnSZEcAQHbsz0e0tZvReFQzpRB1-tVoLDh3cKhIOpqKbD-h7ByCKokqzSMK-KwHnEYlkiQH56Yq4TKg9z5rtKDLO7e4DgCOWWHgn7foxSa_6Lk10DEhBBUsvyG8tnrmcJo8Vl.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ dashboard for viewing status of jobs</figcaption></figure><p>If you do not specify any queue while deploying the service, there is one queue created called “default” and all the jobs you enqueue will go into this queue.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively you can define as many queues as you want, and put jobs into the respective queues based on their priority. All of this is very well documented.</p><p>If you need to monitor some more things like how many jobs are queued at a given time in the form of a time series database or the maximum queued jobs within a given time range, you could export these metrics using <a href="https://github.com/mdawar/rq-exporter" target="_blank">rq_exporter</a> and display them on a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">grafana</a> dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Error handling</strong><br></p><p>Python-RQ has several ways to retry failed jobs, you could specify a retry count while enqueuing the job itself as mentioned in their documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>You could also specify a time interval between each retry if you don’t want the job to be retried immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly you can also specify different time delays between each retry and achieve a system where if a job fails,&nbsp; you retry after 10 minutes and if it fails again, you could retry after 20 minutes, etc.</p><p>Even if you don’t specify any retry count, there is a default safety net built in where the failed jobs go into a “failed” queue and the same is displayed on the dashboard. You can retry them manually by clicking on “Requeue”.</p><p>You can even see the stack trace of the failed job so that you can make changes to the code if required before retrying the job.</p><figure id="w-node-6b3d732c052e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07659bfb9af7bf8dec02_F7KGjCLUhQ6nGEDjK-qpq4jooON2TyQkDBLzi1ova-tz3zSVAgimJ9mIycGnvHcxcCnAUr0Wl5pIHO7OzVEtJLR2D3go52skcan8DTAkYWA05o1AXUmH4ojKFfbT2qXSPBOUUG79.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Failed jobs displayed on RQ dashboard</figcaption></figure><div><p>Python-rq also allows you to define a custom exception handler at the time of starting your workers which you can use to do stuff like sending an alert to yourself over email/slack whenever there is an exception.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Zero loss</strong><br></p><p>When you restart python-rq it does a warm shutdown where new jobs from the queue are no longer accepted and existing jobs will finish running completely before shutting down the service. This ensures that there is no loss in data.</p><p>The producer program which is responsible for enqueuing the jobs must make sure that as soon as an event is received, it is immediately enqueued before running any other logic and this will ensure that there is no loss due to the producer failing to enqueue a job in time.&nbsp;</p><p>Since all the jobs will be saved in the Redis database and Redis has its own methods for prevention of data loss, this pretty much ensures that all your transactions will be executed.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong><br></p><p>The Beauty of this setup is that if your application scales and you start receiving too many events, the server responsible for enqueuing the events will not face any lag and the only implication of this is that there might be a lag between the time a job is enqueued and the time it is executed.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to reduce this lag, all you have to do is deploy another RQ worker that listens on the same Redis queue and the tasks will automatically get shared between all the existing workers that are subscribed to that queue. Based on how your traffic scales, you can keep deploying new workers on new instances without having to change anything else.</p><p><strong>Scheduling tasks with python-rq</strong><br></p><p>An added advantage of this infrastructure is that it also takes care of the case where one has to schedule a task to be executed at a later time. There are of course many ways of achieving this including cron jobs, but having this ability within your queuing infrastructure is very handy because all the other aspects like error handling and monitoring automatically get applied to this as well.&nbsp;</p><p>To add job scheduling abilities to python-rq, you would have to install <a href="https://github.com/rq/rq-scheduler" target="_blank">rq-scheduler</a> and run it as a separate service. This service will take care of picking up jobs that are to be executed at a given point in time and enqueue them into the queue that python-rq listens on.</p><p><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></p><p>For our particular use case, we receive close to 200 transactions per second and because they all go straight into a queue, 99% of these requests have a response time of 25 milliseconds or less.</p><figure id="w-node-2247ea7692bf-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07651bda1c0398075cb6_oDk9wAzBCG3Dmao13tDK-uvkRTWHWk16MZrwMP7IjpnbbKTFElg35xOjtS6KtMfN6epWMPbyH25HySChqv-szF4bu5qGAMeOqxuQyD1Sx3sSwX92G3qdOsR2e09uGv1EnGxSWYW6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Server response time for enqueing jobs</figcaption></figure><p>As for the performance of the workers, we have currently deployed 5 workers and their capacity based on their free time vs busy time looks something like this.</p><figure id="w-node-bd68bbc03805-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765b5a619cd968b387a_zlVorXocx5iEHbrrk0QC_84rfs2IvRLyaKmaFUbMYyGXKw6NTApQfqaxkZPRMaMHX19BOo4510pTC4HuaWGpbzhHVnUFsMdV8jk33AQUU6fDdR42Lv-vaI8zHnJwsRWD5l3QiR89.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ&nbsp;worker capacity</figcaption></figure><p>The blue shade represents workers being busy and the rest of the time workers are free.

        <p>With the unveiling of iOS 14 following WWDC 2020, Apple has again updated its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml?changes=latest_minor">Core ML framework</a> with even richer interfaces for training, running, and fine-tuning machine learning models on users’ devices. Among these improvements, neural network models can now  support <a href="https://lukereichold.com/blog/posts/3d-mnist-swift-for-tensorflow/#3d-convolutional-networks">3D convolutional and pooling layers</a>, which are the backbone of many popular video classification models. Today, we’ll walk through <strong>how to take a pre-trained, off-the-shelf video classification model and get it running on iOS!</strong></p>
<p><em>For an incredibly thorough overview of the other new ML advances for Apple platforms introduced this year, I recommend Matthijs Hollemans’ article,  <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/new-in-apple-machine-learning-2020/">Apple machine learning in 2020: What’s new?</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="-fetching-the-pre-trained-model">⬇ Fetching the pre-trained model</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">Inflated 3D Convnet (or I3D)</a> is an architecture created by DeepMind researchers to perform human action classification for videos. We will use the I3D model that has been pre-trained on DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics">Kinetics 400 dataset</a>. That is, given a tensor containing frames of a video, this model will output probabilities that the given video belongs to any one of 400 respective action classes (e.g. “air drumming”, “making tea”, “bench pressing”, etc).</p>
<p>As this is a TensorFlow model, our goal is to convert it to an <code>MLModel</code> that can be consumed natively on Apple platforms. To get started, we’ll open up <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=gTW3l22wUdHD">a new Colab notebook</a> and import <a href="https://github.com/apple/coremltools"><code>coremltools</code></a>, Apple’s Python library for model conversion, editing, and validation.</p>

<p>The model expects a tensor of shape <code>(1, NUM_FRAMES, 224, 224, 3)</code>, that is, an array of RGB frames, each of size 224 x 224 and – according to the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">model’s original specification</a> — pixel values rescaled to between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>We’d like to make the number of frames dynamic, so that our model works for any video containing between, say, 25 and 300 frames. Therefore, we create a <code>TensorType</code> with a flexible shape that will be passed into the converter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">range_input <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>TensorType(shape<span>=</span>(<span>1</span>, ct<span>.</span>RangeDim(lower_bound<span>=</span><span>25</span>, upper_bound<span>=</span><span>300</span>, default<span>=</span><span>250</span>), <span>224</span>, <span>224</span>, <span>3</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Also, to make using our classifier model easier to consume, we tell the model about our explicit class labels so that these are explicitly visible within Xcode.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">config <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>ClassifierConfig(class_labels)

<span># This is where the magic happens:</span>
mlmodel <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>convert(<span></span><span>"</span><span>kinetics-i3d/frozen_model.pb</span><span>"</span>, source<span>=</span><span></span><span>'</span><span>tensorflow</span><span>'</span>, classifier_config<span>=</span>config, inputs<span>=</span>[range_input])
</code></pre></div><p>We can also choose to add additional metadata to our model:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Optionally, add metadata to be visible in Xcode.</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>license <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Apache-2.0 License</span><span>"</span>

mlmodel<span>.</span>short_description <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Convolutional neural network performing human action recognition on video data, trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset.</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>🎉 With the conversion successfully performed, we’ll save our new <code>mlmodel</code> to disk! It’s now ready to be imported into an Xcode project.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">mlmodel<span>.</span>save(<span></span><span>'</span><span>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</span><span>'</span>)

<h2 id="-consuming-the-model-with-visualactionkit">📦 Consuming the model with VisualActionKit</h2>
<p>As of Swift 5.3, we’re now able to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package">bundle resources with a Swift package</a>, so <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit"><code>VisualActionKit</code></a> was created to leverage this new functionality by effectively acting as a convenience wrapper around our <code>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</code>. It offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepts an <code>AVAsset</code> as input</li>
<li>Pre-processes the asset’s data into a format the model expects, including resizing each frame of the video to 224 x 224 pixels using the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">custom resizing strategy outlined in original I3D model repo</a>.</li>
<li>Builds an <code>MLMultiArray</code> tensor containing the asset data</li>
<li>Feeds the input tensor into our model and asynchronously returns the resulting predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this package for use in our own apps, we add the following to our app’s <code>Package.swift</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>let</span> package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: <span>"</span><span>https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit.git</span><span>"</span>, from: <span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span>)
    ],
    ...
)
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can perform action classifications on any provided videos, regardless of the source or input format! Here’s some example usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>VisualActionKit</span>

<span>let</span> url = Bundle.module.url(forResource: <span>"</span><span>writing</span><span>"</span>, withExtension: <span>"</span><span>mp4</span><span>"</span>)
<span>let</span> asset = AVAsset(url: url)

<span>try</span> Classifier.shared.classify(asset) { predictions <span>in</span>
    print(predictions)
    <span>//</span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>l</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>s</span><span>L</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>e</span><span>l</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>w</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>i</span><span>n</span><span>g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>o</span><span>b</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>i</span><span>l</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>y</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9</span><span>9</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>8</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>3</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>1</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Outside of this specific action classification model, we can use these same steps to convert any arbitrary pre-trained model</strong> to run on Apple platforms by using <code>coremltools v4</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, different than what we did here, if we were interested in <em>training our own action classifier from scratch</em> – without touching any Python or model conversion code – we also have ability to do so now. For more info, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/">2020 WWDC session covering Create ML</a>. Until next time!</p>

																				<p>HANOI: Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease.</p><p>“Patient 416” is a 57-year-old retired Vietnamese man in the southern city of Danang, and the first case of community transmission since April 16.</p>
<p>Local health officials have tested 105 people who had been in close contact with him, the Ministry of Health said.</p>
<p>The man had taken his mother to a hospital in the days before after showing symptoms of the sickness, authorities said, but gave no confirmation of how he was infected in a country where the virus appeared to have been stamped out for several months.</p>
<p>Vietnam has not recorded a single death from Covid-19.</p>
<p>“The patient is currently on ventilator support due to respiratory failure,” the ministry said, adding that his family believe his contacts with others were limited.</p>
<p>“He didn’t go out of the city and only stayed at home to look after his grandchild and interact with neighbours, he didn’t make contact with strangers,” it said.</p>
<p>Danang has been packed with local tourists returning to its beaches and restaurants since Vietnam lifted its lockdown.</p>
<p>Despite sharing a long, ungovernable border with China, Vietnam has recorded just 416 virus cases, including the latest from Danang.</p>
<p>Communist authorities were quick to lock down the country after the virus emerged in China, with a rigorous state quarantine and contact-tracing system put in place.</p>
<p>International flights remain strictly limited with a two-week mandatory quarantine laid out for visitors.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the tough response to the virus will help the economy as foreign investment and local consumer confidence bounces back.</p>									</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The four noble truths in Buddhism forms the core of the Buddha’s teachings. These are explained in the very first sermon delivered by Buddha, known as&nbsp;<em>dhammacakkappavattana sutta</em>, which in English loosely translates to, “Settings the wheel of dhamma or the truth in motion.”</p> <p>Understanding <strong>the four noble truths</strong> is a vast subject that needs a detailed and thorough explanation, and it’s impossible to cover it in a single blog post. However, the information I present here will serve as an introductory text for those who wish to understand Buddha’s teachings.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>What differentiates Buddha’s teachings from others is that he mentions that his teachings should be understood through direct experience rather than simply believing what he says.</p><p>The experiences that he talks about can be verified through different mindfulness practices and meditations. These find mention in the texts (<em>suttas</em>) and practiced by a lot of people all across the world.</p><p>Four noble truths form the foundation of a deep-rooted philosophy that can be applied to daily practical life. The primary focus of his teachings is on the&nbsp;<em>here and now</em>. Although these teaching were delivered sometime around 500 BCE, they have stood the test of time and are still applicable today.</p><p>At first glance, you may find Buddhism to be very pessimistic, as it starts with the concept of dukkha or suffering. Dukkha is a word of the Pali language, which is a combination of two words:&nbsp;<em>du</em>&nbsp;means “hard,” and&nbsp;<em>kkha</em>&nbsp;means “to endure.”<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>Translation of dukkha in English, referred to as the suffering, is a gross oversimplification of the term. Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent in the English language. It has a much deeper meaning, which we shall explore next.</p><h2><span id="The_First_Noble_Truth_There_is_Suffering_or_Dukkha"></span>The First Noble Truth: There is Suffering or Dukkha<span></span></h2><p>The word dukkha is much more subtle than the English word suffering. It constitutes injury, sickness, old age, mental pain, death, sorrow, grief, anguish, and more. It further includes minor frustrations such as disappointments, dissatisfactions, and irritations encountered in daily life.</p><p>It also includes even the most subtle sources of stress like:</p><ul><li>Having to work for longer hours than usual occasionally.</li><li>Not being appropriately apricated for the efforts put into a piece of work.</li><li>Not being correctly greeted by a friend or a colleague at work.</li><li>Having to give more than you receive in a relationship.</li><li>Being rudely spoken to in a demeaning tone.</li><li>Being made fun of in a covert manner.</li><li>Getting irritated standing and waiting in a queue for a cup of coffee.</li><li>Frustration when the server at the coffee shop hands you a latte instead of the cappuccino you asked.</li></ul><p>I can go on and on, but you get the idea. All of this is dukkha. Now you may argue that this is just a normal part of daily living. How can you call it dukkha or suffering? It happens to all of us, and it’s normal, right?</p><p>You may argue that the real dukkha is passing away of a loved one, or losing a job overnight, or losing all of your income because of the collapse of the economy, or getting a divorce. These are more pressing matters. And yes! You’re right. All of the above are dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>But here’s what most people don’t understand. The minor frustrations and dissatisfaction that we encounter in our daily lives have a cumulative adverse effect on our psyche. It grows very slowly in a subtle manner.</p><p>While the death of a loved one hurts a lot initially, the wounds heal with time. The created void may never go, but eventually, much of it is filled up with time. However, the subtle injuries caused to our psyche go undetected in many of the cases.</p><p>Over time, these frustrations get accumulated to such an extent that one resorts to ending one’s life to escape the pain. The problem is that we have normalized ailments like stress, anxiety, and depression, as a part of daily life.</p><p>For example, you might argue that losing a job is much worse than being rudely spoken too. Now, this would depend on your personality.</p><p>But in general, I have observed that people soon forget about the hardships they face during the times of unemployment. But even after years, they still remember the incident where they were ill-treated or rudely spoken too.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Once you get a new job, you forget about the pain of losing your old job. But the incidents of offensive and demeaning behaviors go directly into your subconscious.</p><p>These get accumulated over time and create great mental suffering, and sometimes even manifest as a disease in the physical body.</p><p>Again, you may argue that one cannot escape these unpleasantries of life. And yes! You are right again. But the question is – How much do you intend to suffer these unpleasantries? What we call as ups and downs of life are merely just events. There’s nothing good or bad about them.</p><p>Yet we suffer! And still, continue to suffer.</p><p>Buddha explains that there are three kinds of dukkhas:</p><ol><li>The first is simple to understand suffering, like sickness, injury, old age, death, grief, despair, sorrow, etc. It includes both physical and mental pain. We have already covered this kind of suffering above.</li><li>There is a second kind of suffering that is caused by change. Everything is subject to change and finally comes to an end. There is no such thing as a permanency. However, the mind craves for permanency, and therefore, the suffering arises. For example, expecting secure attachments in relationships, friendships, work, etc.,  results in unhappiness.</li><li>Finally, the third kind of suffering buddha talks about is suffering due to the conditioned states. The word used for this suffering is “<em>Sankara.”</em>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no parallel English word that can describe it. There are five conditioned states, also known as the five aggregates, or&nbsp;<em>skandhas</em>, where one is physical, and the other four are mental.</li></ol><p>Now here’s something to think. If you notice carefully, there’s a contradiction between the statement of the first noble truth and the fourth noble truth.</p><p>The first noble truth says that all in this world is suffering, while the fourth noble truth says that there is a way out of it. How can both of these statements be true?</p><p>You see, the statement of the first noble truth is not an absolute, because the dukkha is born out of ignorance or&nbsp;<em>avidya</em>. Hence, one perceives this world as dukkha. The understanding of the fourth noble truth enables us to experience the world as it is.</p><p>Now that we know what dukkha is let’s get to the next section: the origin of suffering.</p><h2><span id="The_Second_Noble_Truth_%E2%80%93_The_Origin_of_Suffering"></span>The Second Noble Truth – The Origin of Suffering<span></span></h2><p>The origin of suffering is attachment (or L<em>obha</em>) to three kinds of cravings, also known as Tanha (or Trishna in Sanskrit).</p><h3><span id="The_Kama_Tanha_Craving_for_Sensory_Pleasures"></span>The Kama Tanha: Craving for Sensory Pleasures<span></span></h3><p>This kind of craving or thirst comes with the attachment to sensory pleasures. We always seek things that excite our senses. For example, we get exciting seeing a nice car, and a strong desire to acquire it arises from within. In Buddhism, this is the beginning of dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>Anything that satisfies the craving of the five senses: vision, smell, hearing, taste, and touch – is Kama Tanha. The main reason behind this is that these cravings only give temporary satisfaction.</p><p>The moment you set your attention to sensory pleasure objects, that very moment marks the beginning of suffering. The problem with this kind of craving is that it is insatiable. The more you have, the more you want.</p><p>Another example would be eating your favorite food or dessert. Even after you’ve finished eating, you crave more. For some, this craving comes back after a day or two, while for others, it comes back instantly.</p><p>However, the past conditioning of the mind is so intense that we do not see anything wrong with it.

One example would be the desire to continue in the heavenly realms as consciousness after death. In this case, the attachment to life and existence is so high that the very thought of not existing after death scares people.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>Similarly, becoming a monk with the desire to attain enlightenment is also Bhava Tanha. Practicing meditation, chanting, reciting mantras, performing rituals in the desire to achieve the&nbsp;<em>nirvana</em>&nbsp;(the freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth) is again Bhava Tanha.</p><p>It is easy to misunderstand this Tanha. For example, when I started my spiritual practice a couple of years ago, I found myself falling into this trap.</p><p>As I read more into the philosophical aspects of these scriptures, I was so impressed that I immediately started giving sermons to the people around me, even when they didn’t ask for it.</p><p>I had built such strong identifications with these philosophical ideas that I used to get upset when people showed disinterest.</p><p>But my thirst for being the “most knowledgeable” and “all-knowing” had blinded me. I was always keeping a check on how other people perceived me. And I didn’t like it when people disagreed with my ideas.</p><p>What I realized was that I had fallen into the same worldly trap once again. I was indirectly seeking recognition as a spiritual teacher. The desire to be known as the great teacher was deluding me.

It is known as Vibhava Tanha, that is the desire to get rid of things.</p><p>This craving generally happens when we fail in our endeavors, such as building a profitable business or attaining spiritual enlightenment. We quickly get disillusioned by the present circumstances and become opposed to it, believing it to be the root cause of our suffering.</p><p>Therefore, we create a desire to get rid of things that leads to unhappiness. For example, it is seen that people who get disillusioned with money and fame turn towards spirituality in search of solace.

<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>

<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>

<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Poll<span>&lt;</span>Result<span>&lt;</span>usize<span>,</span> T<span>::</span>Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>match</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>byte<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>*</span>ptr <span>=</span> byte<span>;</span>
                Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span>WouldBlock<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span>Pending<span>,</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span><span>Other</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinted-attributes">Fingerprinted Attributes</h2>
<p>We will now look at the attributes collected by the script.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>* Cookie enabled status - navigator.cookieEnabled
* User agent - navigator.userAgent
* Emails in input forms - all non-hidden or blurred inputs are checked with a Regex for emails which are then associated with a Device ID
* If the site is using the Facebook SDK (window.FB is defined), call window.FB.api("/me") and return username and email.
* Do Not Track status - navigator.doNotTrack || navigator.msDoNotTrack
* Audio information - Creating a new HTML5 AudioContext and getting its sampleRate, maxChannelCount, numberOfInputs, numberOfOutputs, channelCount, channelCountMode, channelInterpretation
* Timezone - Creating a new Date object and calling getTimezoneOffset()
* Adblock status - Creating a new element with class "adsbox," adding some text to it, appending it to the body, and checking that its height equals 0 (if yes, then an adblocker is enabled)
* Canvas fingerprinting - Creating a new Canvas, drawing "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/" over it in multiple different colors with a rainbow background, then using the toDataURL function to get the base64 PNG representation
* Private Browser Mode detection - Trying to write data using localStorage, indexedDB, or requestFileSystem
* Font detection - Getting the width/height of the browser "fallback" (default) serif, sans-serif, and monospaces fonts, then measuring the width of a bunch of fonts (Augur's list has over 800) and seeing if there is any differences between the tested font and the defaults
* Media devices (speakers, cameras, microphones) enumeration - navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices
* Installed plugins enumeration - navigator.plugins
* Spoofing detection
    * Browser build number (always 20030107 on Chrome/Safari) - navigator.productSub
    * toString length of eval (33 on Chrome, 37 on Firefox/Safari, 39 on Internet Explorer) - eval.toString().length
    * Error toSource support (Firefox only)
* Touch support - navigator.maxTouchPoints || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints || "ontouchstart" in window || attempting to create a TouchEvent
* Local and remote IP addresses with WebRTC STUN

    * ALPHA_BITS
    * DEPTH_BITS
    * STENCIL_BITS
    * MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE
    * MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

		<p>Do you want to learn how to utterly destroy SJWs in an argument? How about those fascist, right-wing Nazis?</p>
<p>Well, you’ll have to figure out how to do that on your own.</p>
<p>But if you’re one of those buzzkills who wants to give your argumentative opponent a fair shake, the philosopher Daniel Dennett has some advice. In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/0393348784/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><i>Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</i></a>, he provides four simple rules (adopted from those crafted by the game theorist Anatol Rapoport) for criticizing the views of those with whom you disagree:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, ‘Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.’</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An immediate effect of taking such an approach, Dennett says, is that your opponents “will be a receptive audience for your criticism: you have already shown that you understand their positions as well as they do (you agree with them on some important matters and have even been persuaded by something they said).”</p>
<p>Dennett admits that not all opponents are worthy of such respectful treatment, but when they are it pays off to be as charitable as possible. “It is worth reminding yourself,” he says, “that a heroic attempt to find a defensible interpretation of an author, if it comes up empty, can be even more devastating than an angry hatchet job. I recommend it.”</p>
<p>And so do I.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome has been something I've dealt with my whole life. And it seems to follow me, no matter what position I'm in or where I go.</p><p>In middle school, I was in awe of high schoolers and how much they seemed to know. When I became a high school student, I was intimidated by college students who had started to creep their way into the working world. Now, as a college student in that position, I feel like an imposter around students with impressive resumes, including those who interviewed me to join different student organizations.</p><p>It was after joining one of those organizations that I started to see how wrong my perceptions were. These students weren't superhuman figures, they were just kids with hobbies, interests, and really cool personalities.</p><p>At that point, I'd realized the fact that's helped me get through future instances of imposter syndrome: <em>everyone's a human being, just like you and I.</em></p><p>That includes Jeff Bezos, your job interviewer, your high school teacher, your mentor. They're all humans, who've probably gone through the same experiences you have. At some point, your job interviewer was the interviewee. They know your heart's racing, that there are thick beads of sweat building up around your temple, that your brain is just 70% in the game —&nbsp;because they've been there.</p><p>This lesson has helped me in so many places. At work, I'm constantly confused with our massive codebase. Asking questions was a pretty scary thing, especially at the beginning. I didn't want to seem like I didn't know what I was doing, or that I wasn't capable. Plowing through the unknown headfirst didn't work so well for me —&nbsp;I later found out that those confusing things I'd spent 3 hours on could be answered in a minute from someone who knew better. And there was never any judgement, because they'd been there themselves.</p><p>So don't sweat things too much. There's no need to put others on a pedestal. Just see them as another person, not too different from yourself, in a position you want to get to. Reach and ask for help; chances are, they'd be happy to.</p></div><div><div><p><a href="https://roland.imprint.to/">Roland's Notes</a></p><p>My thoughts, stories, and ideas</p></div></div></div>]]>

What is Nintendo playing at?
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-8506159587861018996">
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

July 25, 2020 | https://django-hordak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounting-for-developers.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://django-hordak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounting-for-developers.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">
           <div itemprop="articleBody">
            
  <div id="double-entry-accounting-for-developers">

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23964513">Hacker News discussion</a>, some of what follows may be either incorrect
or abhorrent to those with a good knowledge of accounting practices. I still
feel the following is useful, and that taken as a whole it describes a working
double entry accounting system.</p>
</div>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): -£500 * -1 = <strong>£500</strong></li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>

<p>Let's step back for a second.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Open"AI</a> is not open at all. In fact, everything is closed source and proprietary.</li>
    <li>The ramifications of this blackbox API processing these kinds of queries is enormous.</li>
    <li>Do we want to centralise the worlds AI decision making on a single service/company?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">
<p>commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research, safety, and policy efforts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They recognise that open-sourcing the data means they have no leverage.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">
<p>many of the models underlying the API are very large, taking a lot of expertise to develop and deploy and making them very expensive to run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. You can open-source AND run the infrastructure to make it "more accessible" at the same time.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">
<p>the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology ... harassment, intentional deception, radicalization, astroturfing, or spam ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a losing battle. Other models will come along shortly. By being actually open, they will be infinitely more socially and technically scalable.</p>

<p><strong>Information (and technology) wants to be free.</strong></p>

            <p>Variables are one of the fundamental blocks of any programming language, the way each language defines how we declare and interact with variables can make or break a programming language. Thus any developer needs to understand how to effectively work with variables, their rules, and particularities. In today’s tutorial, we are going to learn how to declare, interact, and scope variables in JavaScript. We will introduce new concepts and important JavaScript keywords like <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>

<h2 id="declaring-variables">Declaring variables</h2>
<p>Nowadays JavaScript has three different keywords to declare a variable, <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and, <code>const</code>. Each with its own properties and particularities. Let’s start by making a simple comparison table of the 3 and then getting into the details.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Keyword</th>
<th>Scope</th>
<th>Hoisting</th>
<th>Can be reassign</th>

<tbody>

<p>Don’t worry if for now, you are not sure what we mean by scope, hoisting, or any of the other attributes. We are going to cover them in detail next.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-scope">Variable Scope</h2>
<p>Scope in JavaScript refers to context (or portion) of the code which determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. In JavaScript, we have 2 types of scope, <strong>local</strong> and <strong>global</strong>. Though local scope can have different meanings.</p>
<p>Let’s work out through the definitions by giving some examples of how scoping works. Let’s say you define a variable <code>message</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// 'Hello World'
</span></code></pre></div><p>As you may expect the variable <code>message</code> used in the <code>console.log</code> would exist and have the value <code>Hello World</code>.  No Doubts there, but what happens if I change a bit where I declare the variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>true</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: message is not defined
</span></code></pre></div><p>Ups… Looks like we broke it, but why? The thing is that the <code>if</code> statement creates a local <strong>block scope</strong>, and since we used const the variable is only declared for that <strong>block scope</strong>, and cannot be accessed from the outside.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit more about block and function scopes.</p>
<h3 id="block-scope">Block Scope</h3>
<p>A block is basically a section of code (zero or more statements) which is delimited by a pair of curly braces and may optionally be labeled.</p>
<p>As we already discussed the use of <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> allows us to define variables that live within the block scope. Next, we’ll build very similar examples by using different keywords to generate new scopes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
{
    <span>const</span> <span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x1</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x1</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>Let’s explain this one as it may look a bit strange at first. In our outer scope, we are defining the variable <code>x1</code> with a value of <code>1</code>. Then we create a new block scope by simply using curly braces, this is strange, but totally legal within JavaScript, and in this new scope, we create a new variable (separate from the one in the outer scope) also named <code>x1</code>. But don’t get confused, this is a brand new variable, which will only be available within that scope.</p>
<p>Same example now with a named scope:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>myNewScope</span><span>:</span> { <span>// Named scope
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x2</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x2</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>While example (<strong>DO NOT RUN THE CODE BELOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong>)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x3</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>while</span>(<span>x3</span> <span>===</span> <span>1</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>x3</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x3</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x3</span>) <span>// Never executed
</span></code></pre></div><p>Can you guess what’s wrong with that code? And what would happen if you run it?… Let me explain, <code>x3</code> as declared in the outer scope is used for the while comparison <code>x3 === 1</code>, normally inside the while statement, I’d be able to reassign <code>x3</code> a new value and exit the loop, however as we are declaring a new <code>x3</code> withing the block scope, we cannot change <code>x3</code> from the outer scope anymore, and thus the while condition will always evaluate to <code>true</code> producing an infinite loop that will hang your browser, or if you are using a terminal to run it on NodeJS will print a lot of <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>Fixing this particular code could be tricky unless you actually rename either variables.</p>
<p>So far in our example, we used <code>const</code>, but exactly the same behavior would happen with <code>let</code>. However, we saw in our comparison table that the keyword <code>var</code> is actually function scope, so what does it mean for our examples? Well… let’s take a look:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
{
    <span>var</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x4</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x4</span>) <span>// 2
</span></code></pre></div><p>Amazing! even though we re-declared <code>x4</code> inside the scope it changed the value to <code>2</code> on the inner scope as well as the outer scope. An this is one of the <strong>most important</strong> differences between <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code>  and is usually subject (in one way or another) for interview questions.</p>
<h3 id="function-scope">Function Scope</h3>
<p>A function scope is in a way also a block scope, so <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> would behave the same way they did in our previous examples. However, function scopes also encapsulate variables declared with <code>var</code>. but let’s see that continuing with our <code>xn</code> examples:</p>
<p><code>const</code> or <code>let</code> example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x5</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>const</span> <span>x5</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x5</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>myFunction</span>()
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x5</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>Exactly as we expected it, and now with <code>var</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>x6</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>x6</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x6</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>myFunction</span>()
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x6</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this scenario, var worked the same way as <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.  Moreover:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>x7</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x7</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: x7 is not defined
</span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, <code>var</code> declarations only exist within the function they were created in and can’t be accessed from the outside.</p>
<p>But there’s more to it, as always JS has been evolving, and newer type of scopes has been created.</p>
<h3 id="module-scope">Module Scope</h3>
<p>With the introduction of modules in ES6, it was important for variables in a module not to directly affect variables in other modules. Can you imagine a world where importing modules from a library would conflict with your variables? Not even JS is that messy!
So by definition modules create their own scope which encapsulates all variables created with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, similar to the function scope.</p>
<p>There are ways though that modules provide to export variables so they can be accessed from outside the module, and that I covered already in the article <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-08-an-intro-to-javascript-modules/">An Intro To JavaScript Modules</a>.</p>
<p>So far we talked about different types of <strong>local</strong> scopes, let’s now dive into <strong>global</strong> scopes.</p>
<h3 id="global-scope">Global Scope</h3>
<p>A variable defined outside any function, block, or module scope has global scope. Variables in global scope can be accessed from everywhere in the application.</p>
<p>The global scope can sometimes be confused with module scope, but this is not the case, a global scope variable can be used across modules, though this is considered a bad practice, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>How would you go about declaring a global variable? It depends on the context, it is different on a browser than a NodeJS application. In the context of the browser, you can do something as simply as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
    <span>let</span> <span>MESSAGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>MESSAGE</span>)
&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Or by using the window object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
    window.<span>MESSAGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>MESSAGE</span>)
&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>There are some reasons you wanna do something like this, however, always be careful when you do it.</p>
<h3 id="nesting-scopes">Nesting scopes</h3>
<p>As you probably guessed by now, it is possible to nest scopes, meaning to create a scope within another scope, and its a very common practice. Simply by adding an <code>if</code> statement inside a function we are doing this. So let’s see an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>nextedScopes</span>() {
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span>

    <span>if</span> (<span>true</span>) {
        <span>const</span> <span>fromIf</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello If Block!'</span>
        <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// Hello World!
</span><span></span>    }

    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>fromIf</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: fromIf is not defined
</span><span></span>}

<span>nextedScopes</span>()
</code></pre></div><h3 id="lexical-scope">Lexical Scope</h3>
<p>In a way, we already made use of lexical scope, though we didn’t know about it. Lexical scope simply means that the children scopes have access to the variables defined in outer scopes.</p>
<p>Let’s see it with an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>outerScope</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Juan'</span>
    <span>function</span> <span>innerScope</span>() {
        <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>) <span>// 'Juan'
</span><span></span>    }

    <span>return</span> <span>innerScope</span>
}

<span>const</span> <span>inner</span> <span>=</span> <span>outerScope</span>()
<span>inner</span>()
</code></pre></div><p>That looks stranger than what it is, so let’s explain it. The function <code>outerScope</code> declares a variable <code>name</code> with value <code>Juan</code> and a function named <code>innerScope</code>. The later does not declare any variables for its own scope but makes use of the variable <code>name</code> declared in the outer function scope.</p>
<p>When <code>outerScope()</code> gets called it returns a reference to the <code>innerScope</code> function, which is later called from the outermost scope. When reading this code for the first time you may be confused as to why <code>innerScope</code> would <code>console.log</code> the value <code>Juan</code> as we are calling it from the global scope, or module scope, where <code>name</code> is not declared.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is thanks to JavaScript closures. Closures is a topic of its own and you can read more about it on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">MDN docs</a>. I’m planning an article to explain closures on simple terms but is not ready at the time of this writing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hoisting">Hoisting</h2>
<p>Hoisting in terms of JavaScript means that a variable is created in memory during the compile phase, and thus they can actually be used before they are actually declared. Sounds super confusing, let’s better see it in code.</p>
<p>This is what a normal flow would look like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>displayName</span>(<span>name</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>)
}

<span>displayName</span>(<span>'Juan'</span>)

<span>//***********************
</span><span>// Outputs
</span><span>//***********************
</span><span>// 'Juan'
</span></code></pre></div><p>Awesome! as expected that works, but what would you think of the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>hoistedDisplayName</span>(<span>'Juan'</span>)

<span>function</span> <span>hoistedDisplayName</span>(<span>name</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>)
}

<span>//***********************
</span><span>// Outputs
</span><span>//***********************
</span><span>// 'Juan'
</span></code></pre></div><p>Wait wait wait…. what? As crazy as it sounds, since the function is assigned to memory before the code actually runs, the function <code>hoistedDisplayName</code> is available before its actual definition, at least in terms of code lines.</p>
<p>Functions have this particular property, but also do variables declared with <code>var</code>. Let’s see an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x8</span>) <span>// undefined
</span><span></span><span>var</span> <span>x8</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Not what you guessed? The fact that the variable is “created” before its actual definition in the code doesn’t mean that its value …</p></section></div>

      <div>
        <p>This post is a recipe for setting up a minimal Kubernetes cluster on
Fedora without requiring virtualization or a container registry. These
two features make the system cloud-agnostic and the cluster entirely
self-contained. The post will end with us running a simple Flask app
from a local container.</p>
<p>This setup is primarily useful for simple CI environments or
application development on Linux. (Docker Desktop has better tooling
for development on Mac or Windows.)</p>
<h3 id="getting-kubernetes">Getting Kubernetes</h3><p>The core of this effort is <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a>, a Kubernetes
distribution that allows us to run on a single node without
virtualization.</p>
<p>But first off, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/">install Docker</a>.</p>
<p>Then install K3s:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
</code></pre>
<p>It may prompt you to adjust some SELinux policies like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install -y container-selinux selinux-policy-base
$ sudo rpm -i https://rpm.rancher.io/k3s-selinux-0.1.1-rc1.el7.noarch.rpm
</code></pre>
<p>Swap these out with whatever it prompts and retry the K3s install.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">install
kubectl</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
</code></pre>
<p>Now copy the global K3s kubeconfig into <code>~/.kube/config</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
$ sudo chown $USER:$GROUP ~/.kube/config
</code></pre>
<p>And enable K3s:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl enable k3s
</code></pre>
<p>If you're on Fedora 31+ you'll need to disable cgroups v2 and reboot:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo grubby --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0" --update-kernel=ALL
$ sudo reboot
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can run <code>kubectl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="a-simple-application">A simple application</h3><p>We'll create a small Flask app, containerize it, and write a
Kubernetes deployment and service config for it.</p>
<p>We begin with <code>app.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello World, Flask!'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Then a <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python:3-slim

RUN pip install flask
COPY . /app

CMD python3 /app/app.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then the deployment in <code>manifest.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: helloworld
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: helloworld
          name: helloworld
</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-in-kubernetes">Running in Kubernetes</h3><p>First we build, save, and import the image into <code>k3s</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build . -t helloworld
$ docker save helloworld &gt; helloworld.tar
$ sudo k3s ctr image import helloworld.tar
$ kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml
$ kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods | grep helloworld | cut -d ' ' -f 1) 5000 &gt; log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
$ curl localhost:5000
Hello World, Flask
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>

<![CDATA[Compilers Do Static Analysis, They Just Don't Tell You]]>

July 25, 2020 | https://pdimov.github.io/blog/2020/07/24/compilers-do-static-analysis/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pdimov.github.io/blog/2020/07/24/compilers-do-static-analysis/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Let’s take the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int * f()
{
    int x = 2;
    return &amp;x;
}

int g( int * p  )
{
    return 3 + *( p? f(): p );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has two errors in it. First, <code>f</code> returns a pointer to a local variable,
which goes out of scope. Second, the check in <code>g</code> is reversed; in the case
<code>p</code> is a null pointer, it dereferences it, instead of doing the opposite –
dereference <code>p</code> only when it’s not null.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rbn9KP">GCC emits</a> for <code>g</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g(int*):
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR ds:0
        ud2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is, it can obviously see that <code>g</code> will either dereference a null pointer
(undefined behavior), or an invalid pointer (undefined behavior), so it generates
code that dereferences a null pointer (<code>mov eax, [0]</code>), which crashes, and then
emits the guaranteed-invalid instruction <code>ud2</code>, which crashes.</p>

<p>(You can’t be too sure, is GCC’s motto.)</p>

<p>And this is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/zW5dzY">Clang emits</a> for the same function:</p>



<p>Presumably, the logic here is that one of the branches leads to undefined behavior,
and the other also leads to undefined behavior, so we might as well remove the whole
thing, it’s not going to get called anyway in a correct program. (But if it does, let’s
just return, as crashing would be gauche.)</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m left wondering here; if the compilers can clearly
see that all possible code paths through this function lead to undefined behavior,
why don’t they <em>tell us that</em>? Something like “Warning: function invokes undefined behaviour
on all control paths, you might want to check your code, mate”, except less formal.</p>

<p>Who cares about that, some might say, nobody writes such code anyway, this will catch
no bugs. Well, I have obviously oversimplified a bit. Let’s take a slightly more
realistic example, such as this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int slice_sum( std::vector&lt;int&gt; const&amp; v, int i, int n )
{
    int s = 0;

    for( int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j )
    {
        assert( i+j &gt;= 0 );
        assert( i+j &lt; v.size() );
        
        s += v[ i+j ];
    }

    return s;
}

int f()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    return slice_sum( v, 3, 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5YGYYd">GCC do</a>?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LC0:
        .string "int slice_sum(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp;, int, int)"
.LC1:
        .string "./example.cpp"
.LC3:
        .string "i+j &lt; v.size()"

f():
        sub     rsp, 8
        mov     ecx, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
        mov     edx, 11
        mov     esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1
        mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC3
        call    __assert_fail
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Goes straight to <code>__assert_fail</code>, without passing Go and collecting $200.</p>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aP5qEW">Clang do</a>? Same thing.</p>

<p>Again, if the compilers can clearly see that calling <code>f</code> produces a guaranteed
assertion failure, why don’t they tell us?</p>

<p>Because we are put here on this planet to suffer, that is why.</p>

<p>(Also because <code>assert</code> is a macro that the compilers do not even see, and they
don’t know that <code>__assert_fail</code> is the assertion failure handler, and contracts,
which would have allowed us to write <code>[[assert: i+j &lt; v.size()]]</code> , were removed
from C++20 as being too useful, but those are just random second-order
manifestations of the cosmic need for suffering.)</p>

</p><p>
According to a report in The Information, an internal programme at Google known as "Android Lockbox" gives employees access to data on how Android users interact with popular, non-Google apps like </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="TikTok" actualkeyword="TikTok">TikTok</keyword><p>, </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Facebook" keynameseo="facebook" actualkeyword="facebook">Facebook</keyword><p> and </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Instagram" actualkeyword="Instagram">Instagram</keyword><p>.
</p><p>
    "When YouTube was planning the rollout of its rival to TikTok in India earlier this month, employees turned to a valuable source of market research: how people in the country were using TikTok and its competitors on Android", the report claimed.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>The programme works via Google Mobile Services (GMS).
</p><p>
    "In some cases, such as YouTube in India, this data helps Google advance its own competing apps, say the people, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely," the report added.
</p><p>
The Google employees can reportedly see "sensitive" data about other apps, including how often they're opened and for how long they're used.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Google-owned YouTube is working on a TikTok rival called Shorts, to be introduced by the end of this year.
</p><p>
"Google is also thought to have used the internal programme to plan the launch of its TikTok competitor called Shorts", according to the report.
</p><p>
    "Android Lockbox" works after Google users agree to share information as part of the Android setup process.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Users are told that this data allows Google to offer a more personalised experience. According to the report, it also provides data for competitive research.
</p><p>
    Google admitted that it has access to usage data from rival apps.
</p><p>
A Google spokesperson told The Verge in a statement: "Since 2014, the Android App Usage Data API has been used by Google and Android developers who have been authorized by Android OEMs or users to access basic data about app usage -- such as how often apps are opened -- to analyze and improve services".
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>"The API doesn't obtain any information about in-app activity and our collection of this data is disclosed to and controllable by users," the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
</p><p>
The US government is set to grill Google along with other tech giants over its dominance in their fields of Search and anti-market practices. The panel announced its antitrust probe into the tech giants in June last year.
</p><p>
    Google isn't the only company that's been accused of such data gathering practices.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>In 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook used a VPN service called Onavo to monitor rival services.
</p><p>
    Onavo Protect -- a Facebook's software that was going to get the functionality -- was billed as a piece of VPN software. Onavo was used primarily to gather information about what other apps Facebook users were using on their mobile devices.
</p><p>
The app was shut down in 2019.

<span><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer.png" alt="Technical drawing of keyboard keys" title="Typometer"></span>Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text / code editors.</p>
<p>Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen update, in particular case – delay between keystroke and character appearance. While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.), typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.</p>
<p>Check my article <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure">Typing with pleasure</a> to learn more about editor latency and its effects on typing performance.</p>
<p>Project source code is available as a <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer/releases/download/v1.0.1/typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip">typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip</a> (0.5 MB)</p>
<p>Java 8 or latter is required to run the program. You can <a href="https://java.com/download">download Java</a> from the official site.<br>
<span id="more-1135"></span></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).</li>
<li>Native API calls for faster screen access.</li>
<li>Synchronous / asynchronous modes.</li>
<li>Import / export of CSV data.</li>
<li>Summary statistics, frequency distribution.</li>
<li>Line / bar charts (including comparative ones).</li>
<li>Chart image export (with legend).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Main window:</p>
<p><img alt="Typometer, main window" title="Typometer, main window" src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-window.png"></p>
<p>Frequency distribution chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-distribution.png" alt="Typometer, frequency distribution chart" title="Typometer, frequency distribution chart"></p>
<h3>Principle</h3>
<p>The program generates OS input events (key presses) and uses screen capture to fully automate the test process.</p>
<p>At first, a predefined pattern (“<code>.....</code>“) is inserted in editor window in order to detect screen metrics (start position, step, background, etc.).</p>
<p>After that, the program types a predefined number of “<code>.</code>” characters into the editor (with given periodicity), measuring delays between key presses and corresponding character drawings.</p>
<p>To achieve high accuracy of measurement, only a single pixel is queried for each symbol. Moreover, the program can use fast native API (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">WinAPI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">XLib</a>) calls on supported platforms, offering <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">AWT robot</a> as a fallback option.</p>
<p>There are two modes of testing available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> – the program always waits for typed character to appear before making a pause and typing the next character. It’s the most accurate method (because there’s no threading overhead).</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> – the program types and recognizes characters independently. This method is slightly less accurate, but it’s useful for testing rapid typing, when editor drawing might easily lag by multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To register only essential editor latency, text must be rendered directly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">framebuffer</a>, without intermediate image processing that might introduce additional delay. Prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">stacking window managers</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositing window managers</a> for the testing purposes, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Classic theme in Windows. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">Windows Aero</a> enforces internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_television#Vertical_synchronization">vertical synchronization</a>, which leads to minimum 1 frame lag (about 17 ms for 60 Hz monitor refresh rate) and delay discretization. It’s also possible to disable the compositing directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021060058/http://www.softwareaudioconsole.com/Tweaking_Windows_7.htm">in Windows 7</a> and <a href="http://www.rlauncher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Input_Lag_Checklist#Disable_Desktop_Composition_in_Windows_8_and_8.1">in Windows 8</a>.</li>
<li>Use Linux distributive with lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, like <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox">Openbox</a>). Complex, 3D-based windows managers might substantially increase system rendering latency, for example, on my hardware, Ubuntu’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a>, adds ~10 ms unavoidable lag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Close all programs that add system-wide keyboard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking">hooks</a>, as they might process the keyboard events synchronously and affect the results (for example, <a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is known to noticeable increase the typing latency).</p>
<p>You may consider switching your machine in a particular hardware mode (power scheme, integrated / discrete graphics, etc.). In power save mode (and on battery), for example, editor responsiveness is usually much lower, so it’s possible to detect significant performance glitches which are less frequently observable otherwise.</p>
<p>Before you start benchmarking, make sure that other applications are not placing noticeable load on your system. It’s up to you whether to “warm up” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">VM</a>-based editors, so they can pre-compile performance-critical parts of their code before proceeding.</p>
<p>If possible, enable non-block caret (i. e. underline / vertical bar instead of rectangle) in editor. This might increase measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>Typical action sequence is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a measurement title, like “HTML in Vim” <em>(optional, can be set later)</em>.</li>
<li>Configure test parameters <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Launch an editor, maximize its window.</li>
<li>Open some data in the editor, for instance, a large HTML file <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Place editor caret in desired context (like comment, etc.), at the end of short / empty line.</li>
<li>Start benchmarking process in the program.</li>
<li>After a corresponding prompt, transfer focus to the editor window.</li>
<li>Wait for test completion, don’t interfere with the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always interrupt the testing process simply by transferring focus back to the program window.</p>
<p>After test result is acquired, you may either analyze the singular data by itself or perform additional tests (different editors / conditions) to do comparative analysis.</p>
<p>Both source- and aggregate data is easily accessible, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy table content  as text,</li>
<li>save chart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> file (with legend and summary stats),</li>
<li>export raw data in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, if you fancy).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible to merge results either by inserting data from an existing CSV file, or by appending data to a CSV file on saving.</p>
<h3>Recipes</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can use the tool to detect performance bottlenecks in text / code editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether number of lines influences the latency. If so, typing might “lag” inside a large file.</li>
<li>Check whether editor window size influences the latency. If so, the editor probably does excessive repainting instead of drawing only a newly inserted symbol.</li>
<li>Check whether latency depends on horizontal symbol position. Ideally, that correlation should be undetectable.</li>
<li>Try to enable highlighting / autocomplete / folding / spellchecker / etc. Those features should be processed asynchronously, without affecting the typing as such.</li>
<li>Try to run the test in power-saving mode. Ideally, typing should be handled decently even on less powerful hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re implementing a text / code editor, take a look at the <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/low-latency-painting-in-awt-and-swing/">programming techniques</a> to significantly reduce the drawing latency.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>To make benchmarking possible, correct screen metrics must be detected at the initial step. The program attempts to recognize a custom pattern (5 new dots) in order to determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting position,</li>
<li>horizontal step,</li>
<li>background color,</li>
<li>line length,</li>
<li>caret type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are many editors (and multiple versions of each editor), which looks different on different platforms, and there are many possible color schemes and fonts, the metrics recognition algorithm has to be very flexible. While the program sources contain a great deal of test cases, some glitches are still probable.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of typical problems and corresponding solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor background is non-uniform (gradient, picture) – set solid color background.</li>
<li>Characters are too low-contrast and obscure – use a crisp color scheme.</li>
<li>Dot characters merge with the caret – increase font size.</li>
<li>Editor replaces multiple dots with ellipsis – disable that auto-correction.</li>
<li>Spaces between dots are uneven – use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced font</a> in the editor.</li>
<li>Editor has a left panel that melds with the text area – hide the panel.</li>
</ul>

        <p><em>(This post was originally written as a reply on the mailop mailing-list, but
a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</em></p>
<p><em>Context: someone with a mail-server hosted in a German facility with a
poor reputation for handling abuse reports was asking for help on
sending email to their Gmail-using friends; they had SPF and didn't see
the point of DKIM; they had TLS setup for their mail-server, using a
certificate from CACert.</em></p>
<p>There's a PDF from Google from 2006 which is still worth reading:
<a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf">https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf</a>, entitled
“Sender Reputation in a Large Webmail Service” by Bradley Taylor.
Anyone running a mail-server today needs to read that document.</p>
<p>If you don't send much email, then the only IP-based reputation which
Google can assess you on is the reputation of your address-block, so
being in a “troublesome” hosting provider will score heavily against
you.  At that point, if not moving away, you need to try to balance out
that negative score with enough positives that any of the large
providers using reputation scoring will accept the mail.</p>
<p>Working forward-and-reverse paired DNS is even more important for IPv6
than for IPv4; for better or worse, some of the large providers have
decided that exemptions in old standards for old behavior should not
apply when folks deploy standards which are far newer.  So you
absolutely need an <code>MX</code> record, you must not just rely upon
address-records (<code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>).</p>
<p>With a poor IP-based reputation, you need to see if you can score a
better domain-based reputation.  This is where DKIM comes into play:
once you can provably link a message to really be from a given domain,
then even if you don't send much mail you can benefit from stuff like
“not on day-old-bread domain-lists”.  But having DKIM and then a DMARC
record does help (and <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2014/04/dmarc-stance/">I'm no fan of DMARC</a>).</p>
<p>For the mail-server's TLS: for that to count in your favor instead of
being a wash, I strongly suspect that it needs to be a certificate which
senders can verify.  For those people scoring up for “better TLS”, those
senders using DANE will be happy with a TLSA record in DNSSEC for your
CACert anchor.  But the large webmail providers are Resistant to having
to deploy DNSSEC verification, so instead have pushed out an alternative
called MTA-STS.  With MTA-STS, you're tied into “whichever subset of CAs
all the large senders you care about will trust”, and then using that CA
for the certificates both for the MTA-STS web-server and for your
mail-server.  Note that you don't need to implement the client logic for
MTA-STS (and I think it's antithetical to an open federated platform)
but do need to just publish the static information for those senders who
do use it. At that point, CACert is not going to cut it.  You'd need to
try Let's Encrypt instead.</p>
<p>The ongoing natural tendency from larger providers is to favor
supporting what the majority of their users want the majority of the
time.  With so many people using larger providers, they naturally tilt
towards stuff which works with the larger senders, and requiring more
hoops.  Those additional hoops create more work for smaller providers
and self-hosters doing thing manually.</p>
<p>We need better automation tools around all of this.  The below will make
it clearer why.</p>
<p>So, here is my current understanding of the best current practices here,
in reality not IETF idealism.  This includes making mandatory stuff
which some folks insist must be optional, because realistically to send
to some large providers it's not optional.  This list includes features
to make you compatible with ongoing trends in the EU (particularly
Germany) to strongly disfavor allowing clear-text SMTP.</p>
<p>This assumes that you are <em>not</em> a large sender who should also be
setting up feedback loops, learning how to “warm” IPs, considering BIMI,
postmaster tooling domain verification, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deliverability-fixes">Deliverability fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>reverse DNS with matching forward DNS; the name used should not
pattern-match anything generic and ideally would include a DNS label
of <code>mail</code> or <code>mx</code> or the like in it.</li>
<li>MX record, always.</li>
<li>Accurate SPF;
<ul>
<li>ideally not too broad; pay attention to SPF's query limits.</li>
<li>avoid <code>-all</code> at the end because, with the sole exception of “this
domain never sends email” records, the larger operators have metrics to
show that using <code>-all</code> <em>tends</em> to be a sign of over-enthusiasm rather
than reality, so it will slightly count against you;</li>
<li>remember to have an SPF record for your <code>HELO</code> hostname, because
when you send a “bounce” rejection, this is the thing which will be
looked up (since there's no domain in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DKIM set up, with thought towards the selector namespace.
<ul>
<li>RSA2048 key is effectively a hard-requirement
<ul>
<li>DNS TXT records consist of one or more DNS strings, each of which
is limited to 255 ASCII characters.  For a key of this size, you
will end up needing two DNS strings in the zonefile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed25519 keys are not yet widely supported, but by now are not
likely to actively break and make things worse for you, if you
dual-sign.  This needs to be a different selector.</li>
<li>Note that for various good reasons you should design this to be
something you routinely rotate.
<ul>
<li>Some folks use yearly, some monthly</li>
<li>I rotate every three months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DMARC record; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489" title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)">RFC 7489</a>
<ul>
<li>But for domains which humans send from <em>don't</em> use
<code>p=quarantine</code> or <code>p=reject</code>;</li>
<li>Do consider setting up a receiver for reports, just so that you can
see how much of a privacy breach DMARC reporting is when you send
to mailing-lists which don't re-sign. :-/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS certificate from a CA in the main trust anchor bundles;
<ul>
<li>Just use Let's Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MTA-STS web-server with HTTPS certificate from the same CA, and the
relevant MTA-STS txt file in place; add the DNS record when it's up
and happy.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" title="SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)">RFC 8461</a>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/">https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/</a> for a testing validation tool
(with thanks to Luis Muñoz for the pointer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the independent mail providers using the stuff broadly supported
in open source MTAs, you should look at DNSSEC, because the patterns
here are less susceptible to rent-seeking pressures:
<ul>
<li>DNSSEC-signed zone for your own domain
<ul>
<li>Use whichever signing algorithm CloudFlare are currently using:
this should be both current for cryptography and widely enough
supported that if it's not supported by someone's resolver, then
they have bigger problems than just your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNSSEC validating resolver for you to look up records of others
(consider <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> or <a href="https://www.knot-resolver.cz/">Knot Resolver</a>)</li>
<li>DANE records for your own domain (TLSA records in DNS)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7672" title="SMTP Security via Opportunistic DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS)">RFC 7672</a> for the SMTP details.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA">RFC 6698</a> for the base spec with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7218" title="Adding Acronyms to Simplify Conversations about DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">RFC 7218</a> for some common
acronyms which make talking about it easier.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7671" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Protocol: Updates and Operational Guidance">RFC 7671</a> for the updates and operational guidance.</li>
<li>There are other RFCs, for SRV records and for OpenPGP, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell your mail-server to obey DANE stuff, so that if there's a TLSA
record in DNSSEC-verified DNS then the mail-server can disable
fallback to cleartext for delivery to MX (and ideally also then
verify the TLS connection has a cert chain which is anchored in one
of the TLSA records)</li>
<li><a href="https://dnsviz.net/">https://dnsviz.net</a> is your friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>_smtp._tls</code> record so you can get reports of TLS failures sending to
you</li>
<li>Seeing if you can get your IP onto one of the open DNS-based
allow-lists (also called “whitelists” but some folks are moving away
from that term), such as <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/">https://www.dnswl.org/</a> or Spamhaus's SWL.</li>
<li>Periodically check if you appear in any DNS-based deny-lists.</li>
<li>Make sure you're not sending from “ISP residential address-space”; if
need be route your mail outbound via a host in better address-space
(and update SPF etc to match)</li>
<li>Don't do sender call-out verification to SMTP servers which aren't
yours.</li>
<li>For your own sanity, do make sure you set up <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>, or something
like it, scanning your mail-server logs, because SMTP AUTH online
cracking is widespread.  If they ever get in, your deliverability
will be negatively impacted by their spam campaign through your
mail-server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convenience-stuff">Convenience Stuff</h3>
<p>Outside of “Phil's BCP” above, additional non-deliverability but
convenience options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS SRV records for submission(s)/imap(s)/pop3(s)/sieve, even if just
to say with «<code>0 0 0 .</code>» that it's not supported.</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using OpenPGP with email,
then set up WKD to publish OpenPGP keys for your domain too.
<ul>
<li>This is just a fixed schema for laying out keys for HTTPS retrieval.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/?include_text=1" title="OpenPGP Web Key Directory">WKD draft</a> for details.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control">https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control</a> as a
management framework for an organization; the
<code>other/standalone-update-website</code> script is designed to be
embeddable into an existing site-building workflow without anything
else from the repository.</li>
<li>The GnuPG project has tooling available which manages the WKD layout as
an email-integrated workflow, for people to update their own keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using S/MIME then set up
SMIMEA records in your DNSSEC-signed DNS.
<ul>
<li>They look a lot like TLSA records; both are trust anchors in DNS.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8162" title="Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names for S/MIME">RFC 8162</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The moment you start specifying “must be TLS-secured” it's worth
adding <code>CAA</code> records into DNS, so that Certificate Authorities which
are broadly trusted will refuse to issue for your domain unless you
list them.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659" title="DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record">RFC 8659</a> for details</li>
<li>The values checked by each Certificate Authority as indicating they
have permission are required to be listed in their Certification
Practice Statement, as part of the CA/Browser forum's Baseline
Requirements.  If it's missing, then browsers are not supposed to
be trusting that CA.</li>
<li>For domain-validation CAs such as Let's Encrypt, consider adding
account information to those records to tie it to your specific
account.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8657" title="Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding">RFC 8657</a> for details.</li>
<li>Beware that at time of writing, Let's Encrypt only honors the
<code>accounturi</code> restriction in their staging environment, not their

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This is a short post reflecting on some pretty basic C++ that bothered me
because I felt like I didn't fully understand it. I felt that the language
should be able to do more, and wanted to understand why it could not.</p>

<p>In C++, subtype polymorphism allows pointers and references of child classes to
be treated as their parents<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span><span> Parent</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    Child<span>*</span> child <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>    <span>foo</span><span>(</span>child<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>    
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is at the core of Object Oriented style programming in C++, and, like all
forms of polymorphism, allows us to write code that is only tied to an
interface, not its implementations. We can swap out implementations easily,
making the code more flexible, as well as more testable: test doubles that
implement the interface can be injected during tests.</p>
<p>C++ also provides another mechanism for polymorphism: templates. Templates
allow us to parameterise interfaces by type. The template <code>std::vector</code>
describes a growable list and is parametrised by the type the list contains.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in C++, you cannot combine these two forms of polymorphism in a
way that you might like to.</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1">1 </span><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2">2 </span>
<span id="L3">3 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4">4 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5">5 </span>    <span>bar</span><span>(</span>children<span>)</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L6">6 </span>    
<span id="L7">7 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>It's easy to explain this by pointing out that <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> does not
inherit from <code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code>, and so why would you expect to be able to
use them interchangeably?</p>
<p>This explanation makes sense intuitively, but I found it to be lacking. I
thought about this:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children_as_parents <span>=</span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span>        <span>*</span><span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>*</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span>children<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    <span>bar</span><span>(</span>children_as_parents<span>)</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>I thought this would be "safe" (we'll see why not below): the memory layout
will still be valid, as the
vector contains pointers, so accessing elements of the vector would work as
expected; and of course, because <code>Child</code> inherits from <code>Parent</code>, accessing the
<code>Parent</code> members after the cast would also work as expected.</p>
<p>I thought: if I know that this is safe, why can't the compiler? If the compiler
can know that it's safe, why doesn't the language allow it without circumventing
the type system with <code>reinterpret_cast</code>?</p>

<p>The example above is not actually safe because the vector is mutable. We could
add pointers to other subtypes of <code>Parent</code> to <code>children_as_parents</code> while still
being able to access <code>children</code>, which would now be undefined behaviour.</p>
<p>This suggests we could never have <code>std::vector</code> behave the way I've described
with subtypes, and immutable containers would be needed instead.</p>

<p>The <code>reinterpret_cast</code> done above would only work because I know that the
implementation of <code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code> and <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> is
identical.</p>
<p>However, that of course isn't the case in general for templates: part of their
function is that you can specialise them for different type arguments.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span><span>class</span><span> A</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>...</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>class</span><span> A</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    <span>double</span> m_<span>;</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>template</span><span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>class</span><span> A</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span>    <span>int</span> bar_<span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you were able to pass <code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> as if it were <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code>, what could that
look like?</p>
<p>When a <code>Child</code> object is copied to a <code>Parent</code> object, it is <em>sliced</em>. This just
means that any data in the child object that isn't part of <code>Parent</code> is not
copied.</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span>        <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span>    <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span>        <span>return</span> foo_<span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L13">13 </span>
<span id="L14">14 </span> <span>private</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L15">15 </span>    <span>const</span> <span>int</span> foo_ <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L16">16 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L17">17 </span>
<span id="L18">18 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L19">19 </span>    Child child<span>;</span>
<span id="L20">20 </span>    Parent parent <span>=</span> child<span>;</span>  
<span id="L21">21 </span>    <span>return</span> parent<span>.</span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L22">22 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>There's no obvious way for this to work for our template example above:
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> does not share the members of <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code>, how could it be sliced
down?</p>
<p>Even if we were to take a reference (which means no slicing would occur), the
problem is essentially the same: <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code> could have a method that
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> does not have.</p>

<p>Of course, we can still write a function that could take a <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code> or
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code>: with templating:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>    <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>        <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span>
<span id="L13">13 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span id="L14">14 </span><span>int</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span> vec<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L15">15 </span>    <span>return</span> vec<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L16">16 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>But what I wanted was to be able to express that my function can take a vector
of any type that implements <code>Parent</code>. This doesn't express that. There's no way
in C++ to explicitly constrain the types on templates. In C++20, concepts
provide a minimal way to do this<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concept constraints are implicitly met, not explicitly implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concepts are orthogonal to the subtype polymorphism I want to ergonomically take advantage of.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the explanation of why you can't pass <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> as
<code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code> is really the same explanation we had at the start: you
can't pass templates of subtypes as templates of parents because the template
itself is not a subtype.</p>
<p>But really, a more meta-explanation is that C++ lacks the ability to constrain
template type arguments. This makes templates inherently inexpressive, and
makes it difficult to harmoniously use templates with inherited types.</p>
<p>This is one place where Rust shines in comparison to C++.</p>

<p>I really like the way Rust approaches polymorphism. Traits are Rust's only
mechanism for polymorphism. They provide a unified way for specifying both
static and dynamic interfaces. They facilitate designs based on composition,
reducing coupling. They allow for explicit constraint of type arguments in
generics.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In Rust, we can express the equivalent of what we wanted above easily:<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<div>

<p>This is the power of a more expressive type system, which to me is such a
crucial part of a programming language. C++'s type system always falls flat for
me, for many reasons: the limited expressiveness shown above; the lack of a way
for the type system to to track object lifetime, so we have a library of smart
pointers instead which can easily be abused; implicit type conversion that can
make code less clear and cause bugs; references that are taken implicitly; a
confusing value taxonomy.</p>
<p>I am definitely complaining here; but I also think part of developing a good
understanding of a system is understanding its limitations, being able to
understand why some things aren't possible, and knowing what a different system
would (or does!) look like. I hope this Rust example has helped with that.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any C++ insight to share I'd appreciate it: it's a
complex topic and I always have more to learn :)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/smattrr">Matthew Fernandez</a> kindly sent me <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/covariance-and-contravariance-in-subtyping/">this blog
post</a>
about the concept of type variance, which gives us a more formal language to
talk about some of the ideas discussed in this blog post, namely that C++
templates are <em>invariant</em>. I desired for them to be <em>covariant</em>.</p>
<p>From the linked blog post, "variance refers to how subtyping between more
complex types relates to subtyping between their components". In Rust,
implementing a trait does not create a subtype of that trait, so there's no
concept of variance to apply to our example above.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The issue of variance in C++ is relevant due to the use of both templates and
subtyping; Rust's unified mechanism for polymorphism, with explicitly met
constraints on type arguments, avoids this issue.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What does it mean to have freedom of speech? Naively, it means that you have the right to express ideas without fear of governmental retaliation or censorship. But that’s not worth much in a vacuum. Free speech is valuable when you are communicating with others: abstractly, freedom of speech means the right to distribute information to an audience.</p> <p>If you frame freedom of speech not in terms of what comes out of your mouth, but in terms of the interaction between yourself and another party,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> then edge cases rapidly emerge. For example, suppose that you are on the street, lawfully raising a protest sign supporting X. You are hoping to persuade passers-by. The government sends in <em>five hundred</em> counter-protestors, peacefully raising <em>not X</em> signs. Your voice is drowned out in the crowd. You are unable to reach the passers-by; it’s as if you were not there. Is this censorship? I am no constitutional lawyer, but the effect is undeniably censorious – it is practically as if you had been sent home by the police.</p> <p>Historically, I haven’t seen this type of scenario give rise to much concern among constitutional scholars – perhaps for reasons of practicality. Perpetually mobilizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf</a> brigades to drown out individual voices is hardly practically feasible.</p> <p>However, this has dangerously changed as discourse has moved online. The real-world constraints to astroturfing do not exist online. With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/">GPT-3</a>, the marginal cost of distributing astroturfed propaganda online has firmly hit zero. GPT-3 represents the newest generation of text-generating AI, and it is extremely good – perfectly indistinguishable from a human in short form, articulate, detailed, and capable of infinite variety in style and tone. Now it is actually possible for any online group discussion to be brigaded by thousands of automated users – indistinguishable from real humans – twisting the conversation, while drowning out the voices of real humans.</p> <p>This will become common in no time. It’s too effective a weapon for malicious states to pass it up. Manual online astroturfing is already widespread. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">Russia</a> pay thousands of state employees to spread propaganda online. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections">Russiagate</a> and the now widespread conspiracy theories on Antivax, 5G, COVID-19, etc. show, it’s very effective: social media platforms have enabled divide-and-conquer strategies at unprecedented scale and granularity. They have become a battleground for the opinions of people in the West, and these people haven’t realized it yet. Using fully automated, infinitely scalable tools to infect the minds of your opponents with malicious ideas and sow discord offers an unprecedentedly high ROI to the villains of the world.</p> <p>Thus, we are moving into a world where bad actors can interfere with free speech with a new form of censorship: the use of automated voices, indistinguishable from real ones, to overpower genuine voices online, and to shape the appearance of public discourse according to their goals. If you believe, as many scholars do, that democratic societies are critically reliant on your freedom to distribute information, then this poses a severe threat.</p> <p>The abstract problem is that on the internet, we don’t have a good way to tell real humans from fake ones. The current state-of-the-art tests are CAPTCHAs with challenges that “only humans could pass”: read the word, click all the squares with traffic lights, and so forth. Obviously these aren’t going to resist automation for long. They will be useless across the board in a few years, once general image recognition tools are as good as some substantial minority of humans.</p> <p>In the long term, AI will be effectively impossible to distinguish from humans online. The only solution is to use what we have and they don’t – real-world identification. A real-world ID could correspond to some set of private keys, so you could sign your online actions to prove their human authenticity. You could have a large number of private keys, so as to enable ample pseudonymity. However, true anonymity – not leveraging real-world identity in some sense – becomes impossible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> without opening up the possibility of mass creation of automated trolls.</p> <p>In conclusion: free speech is not just about freedom from straight-forward censorship, but about your ability to participate in discourse without state interference. GPT-3 marks a new generation of tools enabling states to interfere in online discourse with unprecedented scale and persuasiveness, enabling great damage at low cost. It is clear that on the internet, AI will become indistinguishable from genuine humans in the next few years. To that extent, we have to protect our freedom of speech. It seems like requiring real-world IDs and coupling them with public key cryptography is the only way out, which keeps pseudonymity but loses anonymity.</p> <p>Losing anonymity to protect free speech is counter-intuitive and somewhat repulsive. I believe in individual freedom as the highest ideal. I used to think anonymity was one of the greatest values provided by the internet. And I acknowledge that eliminating anonymity to protect free speech comes with its own issues in the long run: for example, a malicious government could abuse the real-world-ID-to-private-key link to very effectively crack down on free speech. I don’t <em>like</em> the solution I am advocating, but it’s a difficult trade-off.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DevOps doesn’t have to be all work and no play. I built 5 stupid (but fun!) GitHub actions… because <em>why not</em>?</p>
<p>The full code for these actions can all be found in this <strong><a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions">GitHub repo</a></strong>. I encourage you to fork and/or add issues/PRs with impractical actions of your own!</p>
<p>I also recorded a video about this project on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-ugGAYVCo">YouTube</a></strong>. ← Check out the video and subscribe if you are into this sort of thing 🙏</p>

<h2 id="what-is-github-actions">What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It can be used to automate things such as building, testing, and deploying code and can be triggered by any GitHub event.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> where developers can publish their actions for others to use.</p>
<p>While I have used many CI/CD systems including Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, and CircleCI, prior to this project I hadn’t explored GitHub Actions, so I thought I would try it out and have some fun along the way.</p>
<p>Enough preamble, let’s get to the stupid stuff!</p>
<h2 id="the-actions">The Actions</h2>
<h3 id="1----holiday-reminder">1 – Holiday Reminder</h3>
<p>Starting simple with this first action, I take advantage of the fact that actions can be triggered on a cron schedule to create the following 10 line action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: holiday-reminder-happy-new-year
<span>on</span>:
  <span>schedule</span>:
    - <span>cron</span>: <span>'0 0 1 1 *'</span>
<span>jobs</span>:
  <span>happy-new-year</span>:
    <span>runs-on</span>: ubuntu-latest
    <span>steps</span>:
    - <span>name</span>: throw error
      <span>run</span>: exit <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The action will run at midnight on New Year’s day and fail every time due to the non-zero exit code. This will cause GitHub to send me an email wishing me a Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉.</p>
<h3 id="2----recursive-action">2 – Recursive Action</h3>
<p>The next idea was proposed by a friend and former colleague (<a href="https://scotchka.github.io/)">https://scotchka.github.io/)</a>. He suggested that I make an action which triggers itself, thus creating an infinite chain of actions.</p>
<p>Given that the GitHub documentation explicitly states <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">“To minimize your GitHub Actions usage costs, ensure that you don’t create recursive or unintended workflow runs,"</a> this seemed like a sufficiently stupid idea. To achieve this, I created an action triggered by commits that makes and commits a code change of its own.</p>
<p>There are two interesting parts to this action:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub helps prevent users from accidentally doing this by not triggering actions based on events associated with the default <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. In order to get around this, I created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/recursive.yml">action yaml file</a> for how this gets used.</li>
<li>In order to prevent the infinite action chain, I persist a count of the action executions within a file in the repo and increment it with each execution. This allows me to terminate the action chain when I reach a specified limit.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">COUNTER_FILE<span>=</span>./recursive/counter.txt
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>5</span>

count<span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat <span>"</span>$COUNTER_FILE<span>"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    echo <span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span> &gt; $COUNTER_FILE
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="ea99838eaa8e8f9c859a998e83988f899e839c8fc4898587">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    git add $COUNTER_FILE
    git commit -m <span>"Incremented counter file"</span>
    git push 
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><h3 id="3----exponential-action">3 – Exponential Action</h3>
<p>The previous action has the potential to run indefinitely, but only one instance executes at a time, so it could be stopped manually if necessary. What if instead, the action triggered itself multiple times? This way, if it got out of hand there would be no stopping the exponential growth 😰. That sounds dumb… lets do it!</p>
<p>The file counter trick from before no longer works because multiple actions would be executing in parallel, all trying to modify and commit simultaneously causing conflicts. Instead, I stored the state in Git tags!</p>
<p>A random UUID is used as the base for the tag and the current iteration is appended to prevent collisions. The current implementation only support single digits, but if I make it past 9 iterations of exponential growth that means I messed up 💀.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> increment_tag_push <span>{</span>
    uuid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span>
    suffix<span>=</span><span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span>
    tag<span>=</span>$1.$uuid.$suffix
    git tag -a $tag -m <span>"New UUID tag"</span>
    git push origin $tag
<span>}</span>

count<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>echo -n $GITHUB_REF| tail -c 1<span>)</span><span>"</span>

echo $GITHUB_REF
echo $count

sleep <span>10</span> <span># In case something goes wrong (this saved me during development 😳)</span>
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>2</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="16657f7256727360796665727f647375627f60733875797b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 1; i &lt;<span>=</span> $1; i++ <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
    <span>do</span>
    increment_tag_push $i
    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><p>If you are looking for a quick way to burn through your 2000 free tier minutes… this is definitely the way to go!</p>
<h3 id="4----smart-lights">4 – Smart Lights</h3>
<p>Thus far, these actions have been implemented in small bash scripts. In order to actually explore the capabilities of GitHub actions I decided the next action should utilize <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action">Docker</a>.</p>
<p>I had a couple of WiFi smart plugs from VeSync that I received as a gift a few years ago and found a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyvesync/">python client for their API</a>. This made it simple to create an action which turns the lights on for a short period of time after each commit (what better way to incentivize code velocity?!💡)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/lights-off.gif" alt="images/lights-off.gif">
<figcaption>Lights on... Lights off!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The code for this one isn’t particularly interesting, but because the action is using more than just bash, it requires an <code>action.yml</code> file in which we can see how inputs get passed into the action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: <span>'Turn on Lights'</span>
<span>description</span>: <span>'Turn on smart home lights for a few seconds'</span>
<span>inputs</span>:
  <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>:  
    <span>description</span>: password for VESYNC_PASS
    <span>required</span>: <span>true</span>
<span>runs</span>:
  <span>using</span>: <span>'docker'</span>
  <span>image</span>: <span>'Dockerfile'</span>
  <span>env</span>:
    <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>: ${{ inputs.VESYNC_PASS }}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="5----tic-tac-toe">5 – Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>With the team starting to get a bit burnt out having to commit code constantly just to keep the lights on, I decided to implement a game of Tic-tac-toe to let them burn off some steam. The trick is that the computer player for this game executes within an action!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="images/tic-tac-toe.png">
<figcaption>Command line interface + board state file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to try out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action">Javascript runtime</a>, so I built the game with Node, persisting the board state in a text file. Since the point of this game was to learn about actions the computer’s strategy is random, but this has the added benefit of letting the human win, boosting morale 🤔.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, GitHub Actions turned out to be fairly easy to work with and the option Dockerize the action steps ensures that it should be able to support pretty much any CI/CD need. Also, GitHub has made sharing and reuse of actions a core part of the experience through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>While I’m won’t be rushing off to port existing CI/CD workloads onto GitHub actions, I will certainly consider it for future greenfield projects!</p>

      <div><p>#SSSSS</p>
<p><em>Stupid</em>
<em>Simple</em>
<em>Static</em>
<em>Site</em>
<em>Starter</em></p>
<p>IMPORTANT: SSSSS requires that a markdown renderer be installed, and be
executable from a shell as 'markdown'. SSSSS assumes that the renderer will
only render exactly what is in the file, and not add anything like &lt;body&gt;
tags.</p>
<p>In addition to this assumption, SSSSS assumes that</p>
<pre><code>$ markdown file.md
</code></pre>
<p>will output the generated html to stdout.</p>
<p>EQUALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT: SSSSS assumes that there is a POSIX sh at
/bin/sh. If there isn't, who knows what will happen, but probably not what
you want. In addition, s5-render does pass some user defined values to sh in
the form of path names. If you run it somewhere where a path includes valid
commands, you're gonna have a bad time.</p>
<hr>
<p>##About</p>
<p>This program will take a directory structure consisting of directories with
images and markdown files and render it to an html website.</p>
<p>The top level directory will include templates for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The html-header.html (<code>&lt;!doctype&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags.)</li>
<li>The document-header.html (<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and whatever html you want to be included in the
header of your website.)</li>
<li>The document-footer.html (Your html for the footer, followed by <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When SSSSS renders a given Markdown file it will place the templates and
markdown in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>html-header.html</li>
<li>document-header.html</li>
<li>input.md</li>
<li>footer.html</li>
</ol>
<p>One final feature. If you put a document-header.html file in the <code>top</code>
directory or one of it's sub-directories, that document-header.html file will
be passed down the directory tree, in order to make things like a tabbed
interface require less JS and/or drudge work. If you use this feature, be aware
that if you put a document-header.html into a child directory, you need to put
one in the parent as well, or else sometimes the child will leak upwards.</p>
<p>This is a bug, but one that I've found easy enough to work around that I
haven't felt compelled to fix it yet. If at some point there is demand for
this, I may fix it.</p>
<hr>
<p>There must be exactly one markdown file in each directory of the structure that
SSSSS is called on. SSSSS will take this:</p>
<pre><code>DemoSite
|- html-header.html
|- document-header.html
|- footer.html
|
\-top
  |- document-header.html
  |- index.md
  |
  \-about
  | |- document-header.html
  | |- about.md
  |
  \-blog
  | |- document-header.html
  | |- blog.md
  | |
  | \-post-one
  | | |- post-one.md
  | |
  | \-post-two
  |   |- post-two.md
  |
  \-other
    |- document-header.html
    |- other.md
</code></pre>
<p>and turn it to:</p>
<pre><code>DemoSite
|- html-header.html
|- document-header.html
|- footer.html
|
\-top
 |- document-header.html
 |- index.md
 |- index.html
 |
 \-about
 | |- document-header.html
 | |- about.md
 | |- index.html
 |
 \-blog
 | |- document-header.html
 | |- blog.md
 | |- index.html
 | |
 | \-post-one
 | | |- post-one.md
 | | |- index.html
 | |
 | \-post-two
 |   |- post-two.md
 |   |- index.html
 |
 \-other
   |- document-header.html
   |- other.md
   |- index.html
</code></pre>
<p>Although it seems strange that it would render every markdown file to a file
called index.html, there are actually two reasons. First, it allows you to have
nice looking URI's without needing to do any extra configuration in your
webserver. Second, it allows for less and simpler code, which makes this easier
to hack on for anyone who feels interested.</p>
<hr>
<p>##Tutorial</p>
<p>So you read through all that and still want to try this out? Cool. Start by
cloning this repository and installing some markdown program. After you have
done this, move the programs s5-generate.sh and s5-render into your path
somewhere, or just remember their fully qualified path.</p>
<p>Next, run</p>
<pre><code>$ s5-generate.sh HelloWorld
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new site called, you guessed it, HelloWorld. Move into the
HelloWorld directory you just created, you should see the template files
mentioned above, and a directory called top. The interior of top is where your
site will start.</p>
<p>Go ahead and cd yourself into top, and create a markdown file with content of
your choosing. I'm just going to go with a nice "Hello, World".</p>
<pre><code>file: WhateverNameYouWant.md
</code></pre>
<pre><code>#Hello, World!

Why does the world never say hello back?

</code></pre>
<p>After doing this, cd back up into the HelloWorld directory. Once there, run
s5-render and go back down into top. There should now be whatever markdown
file you created, along with an index.html file. Go ahead and play around
with changing the template files at the top, and look at how the outputed html
files change.</p>
<p>Presumably if you've found this, you know enough about computers to figure it
out from here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2 id="introducing-the-editor">Introducing the Editor</h2>
<p>Collaborative editors are defined by the size and speed of their
updates. On a website you might submit a form, but in a collaborative
editor you can send a single character or key press.</p>
<video controls="" width="100%">
    <source src="https://caolan.uk/articles/inside-a-collaborative-text-editor/google-docs-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>Those tiny edits are shared quickly so you feel connected to your
collaborators and can anticipate their actions. This experience is
described as <em>real-time</em> editing.</p>
<p>Inside your editor, however, the frequent edits form a hotbed of
conflicting updates. Solving or avoiding these conflicts is the real
challenge of a collaborative text editor.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>
<p>Taking turns, two authors might avoid a conflict - if they have the
patience.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/4154d7b675ec700e00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But our collaborative editor has many authors. To block one author's
key press until another releases their keyboard would be infuriating.
Instead, they each edit a copy of the document and submit changes
when ready.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/57a61b3a6fefc58700.png" title="Their legs are crossed. That's probably not obvious."></p>
<p>To submit, the first author can simply swap his copy for the
original - with no prior updates, his edits apply cleanly.</p>
<p>The second author, however, will find - in place of the original - the
first author's copy. Where she re-worded a sentence, he might have
deleted the whole paragraph. She cannot replace the document without
losing his work, so she must compare the two and decide how, and if,
her edits still apply.</p>
<p>Most collaborative editors do this automatically, behind the scenes,
for every change to a document.</p>
<h2 id="operational-transformation">Operational Transformation</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d16f9e7203a8563100.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The process of re-writing your edits to account for the work of others
is called <em>Operational Transformation</em>. It's the most popular way to
implement a collaborative editor and is used by Etherpad and Google
Docs.</p>
<p>Concrete examples will follow, but for now let's start with two
tubes: the kind you buy tennis balls in.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/155936b3bca3740700.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each tube has a starting state - a yellow ball - and each is held by a
different artist. At the same time, each artist adds a coloured ball
to the tube and informs their partner.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d4d34a8e9cee60a400.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing a yellow ball and a blue ball stacked on top, the right showing a red ball in place of blue. Beside the tubes are two artists saying 'blue' and 'red' respectively." title="We're not acorns, we're artists."></p>
<p>If they apply their partner's update naively, their tubes will look
different: red-blue-yellow one side and blue-red-yellow the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f4f128e9fa2cfce00.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing from top to bottom: red, blue, yellow, the right: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>No single tube is correct - the colours were added simultaneously -
but the artists should agree a result.</p>
<p>To resolve the tie, they can invent an arbitrary rule. One that, when
applied by both artists, will arrive at the same state.
They could discard every ball… but the result is disappointing. How
about: "when inserts are tied, insert red before blue"?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/74a0a8e0c99fd7b500.png" alt="Two tubes, both showing from top to bottom: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>By applying the same rule their states <em>converge</em>. This is the
principle behind Operational Transformation and it can be applied to
many authors typing at once.</p>
<h2 id="handling-text">Handling text</h2>
<p>In a text document, you can improve such a rule by examining the
position of the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/9ae873262f52072300.jpg" alt="Tama under a blanket with the caption 'sleepy cat'." title="Mraow"></p>
<p>Here's a photo of our cat Tama. I've labelled it "sleepy cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui (our other cat) both update my caption at different
positions. When Tama receives Yui's edit, she'll need to
shift Yui's "grumpy" right to account for her insert of "very".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f7a6a5a6edbee75500.png" alt="Two editors with the same state: very sleepy grumpy cat. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;grumpy &quot; 12'."></p>
<p>If she applied Yui's edit at its original character position, Tama
would have the state <strong>"very slgrumpy eepy cat"</strong>. But by understanding
how their concurrent edits affect one another, Tama's editor can
recover.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't rely on position alone - what if they both
insert text at the same location?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d56daf5a9e4e722f00.jpg" alt="Tama on top of the blanket with the caption &quot;Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Another photo, labelled simply: "Tama".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/086ae591d859549800.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;happy Tama&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui both make an edit at the beginning - position 0.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/819f09cfa16942c400.png" alt="Two editors showing a conflict. Tama has applied 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;playful happy Tama&quot;. Yui has applied 'INS &quot;happy &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Like our artists, Tama and Yui are tied for position. To resolve this,
we invent another arbitrary rule and order the inserts by Tama and
Yui's <em>editor ID</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8c2ab5057501f00500.png" alt="Two editors with the conflict resolved. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 6' and now also has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Yui has ID <code>[2]</code>, which is greater than Tama's <code>[1]</code>, so Tama
shifts Yui's insert after her own to converge on: <strong>"happy
playful Tama"</strong>.</p>
<p>We applied only two concurrent edits, but if Tama made multiple
changes, she would need to transform Yui's insert for each -
potentially shifting it multiple times before its final position.</p>
<p>I hope you feel confident after that, because - to demonstrate the
risks - I'm going to present a puzzle that threw the early algorithms
off-course.</p>
<h2 id="false-ties">False ties</h2>
<p><img alt="A photo of Yui with the caption 'little cat'." src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/750197ed186d7d3c00.jpg" title="Ah yes, all innocent - you wouldn't believe the noise."></p>
<p>The puzzle begins with a third author. And, since we only have two
cats - that's Yui above - I've introduced a fictional bunny: Bandit.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f57d6afe96060d5d00.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;little loud cat&quot;. Bandit suggesting &quot;cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;cute little cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Bandit doesn't think Yui is small and deletes the word 'little'. After
applying all their edits, we expect the final caption to read: "cute
loud cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8bd6291f807f45ce00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But there's a problem - because Bandit deletes the word separating
Tama and Yui's edits, a transform step might (falsely) tie them for
position. I'll demonstrate by stepping through Tama and Bandit's
transforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d1431eaff0d5f1a600.png" alt="Tama applying 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 7', 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'DEL 5..12' to get the state &quot;cute loud cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama arrives at the correct result <strong>"cute loud cat"</strong> because she
applies Bandit's delete <em>after</em> her and Yui's inserts. Bandit,
however, applies his delete first.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/09c1793a9bf57cd800.png" alt="Bandit applying 'DEL 0..7', the transformed message 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0' to get the state &quot;loud cute cat&quot;."></p>
<p>His delete shifts Tama's "loud" to position 0. Yui's edit now ties
with Tama's, so Bandit must apply the arbitrary rule and order their
inserts by editor ID - <code>[1]</code> Tama's "loud", followed by <code>[2]</code> Yui's
"cute". Bandit incorrectly arrives at <strong>"loud cute cat"</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn't anticipate that you're in good company. Many academic
papers on Operational Transformation (OT) suffered similar
<em>counter-examples</em> (or bugs, to the practitioner) on publication.
Thankfully these puzzles have now been solved, as evidenced by the
widespread use of OT in the wild.</p>
<p>You can find the solution to our puzzle in the 30 years of OT research
since 1989. But to keep your curiosity in check, consider the
following: if an edit could be <em>undone</em>, conflicts could be rewound
and replayed in a fixed order. It's more work, and could still cause a
false tie, but at least everyone would encounter the <em>same</em> tie.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're now suitably paranoid. Operational Transformation is
easy to explain but complex to implement. If only there was a way to
avoid conflicts altogether…</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-conflicts">Avoiding conflicts</h2>
<p>Remember the two artists? I have another commission for them, this
time using coloured liquid instead of balls.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7039688af6d8494800.png" title="There are plenty of yellow liquids."></p>
<p>They each start with a tube containing yellow dye, to which they add
their own colours. Yellow and blue to make green; yellow and red to make
orange.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/48d447c836121b4600.png" alt="A blue drop being added to the left tube to make green. A red drop being added to the right tube to make orange."></p>
<p>Finally, they inform each other and add their partner's dye to their
own.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/35549bbf749c16a000.png" alt="A red drop being added to the left tube to make a sort of grey colour. A blue drop added to the right tube to make the same grew colour."></p>
<p>What a lovely colour! - but at least they didn't have to apply any
transforms to converge on it. Because the artists used liquid,
the order they added the dye is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Using a data type with the same property for text we could eliminate
conflicts there too.</p>
<h2 id="conflict-free-replicated-data-types">Conflict-free replicated data types</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>One elegant data type, called LOGOOT (an example of a conflict-free
replicated data type, or CRDT) is built upon each edit holding a
unique position - represented by a list of integers.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/1a9e80211f2fe7f900.png" alt="&quot;[10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>The list is comprised of: a positioning number, the author's editor
ID, and a counter.</p>
<p>Every edit increments the author's counter. In combination with their
editor ID, it ensures the position is unique. The positioning number
places the text in the document.</p>
<p>To insert a word at the beginning of the document (before "sleepy")
Tama <code>[1]</code> would create a new position list that starts with a random
value between 0 and 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/db8ec7b35046ae4700.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>Yui <code>[2]</code>, unable to generate an integer between 10 and 11, chooses a
new random positioning number and appends her values to the preceding
list. By growing the list, Yui can always find a position between two
adjacent words.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/e74bdd81e27aab8200.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [10, 0, 1, 130, 2, 1] GRUMPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>You can insert these four words - ordered by their position lists - in
any sequence. You'll always arrive at the same result.</p>
<p>The example above uses a position list per word, but you'll probably
want a position list per <em>character</em> - occupying significantly more
space than the text alone in exchange for predictable performance.</p>
<p>Praise for the performance of CRDTs often rests on the worst-case
scenario: a long conflicting history of edits. In practice,
Operational Transformation can perform millions of simple transforms a
second and grants greater freedom to optimise the data structure - so
you might find OT performs better where fast feedback and short
conflicting histories are the norm.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using a modified version of LOGOOT. In the end,
what convinced me was, not performance, but greater confidence that my
code is correct.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>It seems incredible that, after 30 years of research, many products
still restrict work to a single author or just lose overlapping edits.
If, instead, we apply techniques to detect, avoid, and resolve
conflicts, we <em>can</em> write good collaborative software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in March, my kids were super excited for a few days off for their Spring Break. I took a week off so I could be home with them and not have to worry about work. I still haven’t been back to the office, and they haven’t been back to their school.</p>

<p>I doubt there’s anybody that’s not aware of the current world situation regarding COVID-19. In March, my kids’ school decided that the risk of having all those kids in one place was too great, and they moved to a “School from Home” setup. My work did pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty fortunate in that my work supports a “From Home” option, and I’ve been full time from home before. I was already setup to do anything and everything I needed to do for my job right from my house.</p>

<p>My company offered basic supplies to take home if we needed them. Keyboards, mice, monitors, even chairs. I passed on pretty much all of that because I already have a good setup at home to work with. My laptop is all I need to work from pretty much anywhere in my house.</p>

<p>It’s been four months now. I confess, I’m burning out.</p>

<p>I recently attended a conference called SRE From Home, which was really interesting to me. One of the things said in one of the presentations stuck with me. To paraphrase, the reason we’re all burning out isn't because we’re working from home, it’s because we’re living at work.</p>

<p>That really struck home for me. I took a step back and really looked at how I’ve been doing this.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, I got up in the morning at a fixed time. I showered, got myself and my kids fed, the kids off to school, and then I drove in to work. I plopped my laptop down on my desk at work and <em>that</em> is when my work day started. I did my job until the end of the day, and then I packed up my stuff into my laptop bag and I drove home. I picked up my kids, got dinner ready, did homework with them, and got them to bed. I’d sit with my wife on our couch and watch a TV show or two and then go to bed.</p>

<p>Now, during the pandemic, my schedule is entirely different. I still get up at a fixed time, but the kids don’t go to school and I don’t go to work. I walk the required fifteen steps from my bedroom to my office and I plop down at my desk with my computer already running and open. It never closes anymore. It’s always there. I go grab a quick lunch, but rarely actually take a lunch <em>break</em>. I eat in my office at my desk. When my kids come grab me to tell me they’re hungry, I fix them something to eat, and then I’m right back at my desk. Dinner time roles around, and it’s the same routine. Even after they’ve gone to bed, the computer is still there, open and waiting. I’ll check my email in the evening and manage some small tasks right up until the point I go to bed.</p>

<p>Looking at this now, I realize that I <em>never stop</em> working. If I’m awake, I’m at work.</p>

<p>This is something I’m going to have to change.</p>

<p>I did something different today. I have to work tomorrow for server upgrades, so I “left” early. I closed my laptop down at three o’clock, and I went and took a nap. I haven’t looked at my computer since. It’s still sitting there on the desk, but the lid is closed, and I’m not going to open it until tomorrow night for the upgrades. When those are done, the lid will close again, and I’m sleeping in on Monday.</p>

<p>There are four hours of work scheduled for me Saturday night to Sunday morning, and those are not going to be “Free Work Hours”.</p>

<p>I need to start setting boundaries. There needs to be a line between “work” and “not work”. If I can’t draw that line, I’m going to drive myself crazy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have wanted to build a social network for 8 years, but it was much harder to
make software for the web back then. Also, 8 years ago, I was not even a
software developer yet, so there is that. But now I am (thanks
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a>!), and we are living in the
easiest time to be a software developer since Jeff Goldblum uploaded a virus to
an alien mothership.</p>
<h2>Quid Sentio</h2>
<p>The time was kind to my idea of what a social network should be too. It aged
well, and now it's time to uncork it. I am building <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/">Quid
Sentio</a>, a shareable personal journal. I am not
calling it a social network site, but it is. Well, it will be. It's just the
basics now but open in public beta in the hopes someone will care.</p>
<p>What I am building now is much more mature than what I envisioned back then. The
core idea is the same -- keeping in touch with real friends, the closest friends
and family-- but the foundation is much more robust these days. In the meantime,
Path has come and gone, people saying they have quit Facebook have come and
gone, data leaks and privacy abuses have come and stayed.</p>
<p>I want to build Quid Sentio upon the principle of privacy. Privacy as freedom
from being observed. From being observed by non-friends, from being observed by
companies, from being observed by people who bought your data in the deep web
after a database leak.</p>
<p>The first two are just consequences of design and business choices. Adding a
little bit of friction for adding friends -- so no one can spam-add all their
contact list; keeping shared posts visible only by your direct friends -- so no
virality or friends of friends stalking you. A subscription-based business model
-- so no ads, no invasive tracking. The third level of privacy is not that
simple.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is one thing that gets harder and harder to do in software
development. At the same time, services that do it better than me are more
accessible. This is the first reason why I decided to build my project using
other people's infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second reason is that I want to limit how many things I have to juggle in my
mind while building it. I read in Sapiens that the Cognitive Revolution started
70,000 years ago. I am pretty sure it ended when I made 40. Some things look
attractive from afar, but I can pass without them, and I am happy enough just
hearing people talking about it. Things that fall into that bucket are Finnegans
Wake, EVE Online, Dwarf Fortress, and Vim. Other things I cannot pass by
without, and I have no idea how to do it myself.</p>
<p>The inevitable implication is that I had to find other people to do my job for
me. I wanted to focus on building the UI, creating the application logic,
designing the experience that would make my product unique. Not the devops, not
the infra, not the data plumbing, none of those solved problems. I found people
that do these better than I could possibly ever do in Netlify and FaunaDB. There
is also other software taken for granted that are worthy, but not newsworthy at
this point. Like Stripe, AWS S3, and the plethora of open-source software that
are the buried giants whose shoulders I am standing on while pretending to be in
a mountain that I climbed all by myself.</p>
<p>Economics teaches you about comparative advantage. People in those companies
have the advantage of being smart; I have the advantage of using their service's
free tiers. Not sure I got that economics thing right.</p>
<p>The defining technical characteristic of my application is using good things
with bad names. I built it on a serverless architecture, which is the same as
calling food delivery "kitchenless food". I am using JAMstack, which is an
acronym for static websites or dynamic web apps using a stack with Javascript,
APIs and markup language but not like all those other websites and web apps that
also use Javascript, APIs and markup language in a totally different way. I
would be much happier calling serverless architecture, “Boaty”, and JAMstack,
“McBoatface”.</p>
<p>Still, just like Panama hats from Ecuador, they are great things. They are
powerful ideas, implemented, and popularized by great companies that I am using
to build mine.</p>
<h3>Netlify Build and Netlify Functions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is famous for how simple and intuitive it is
to create static sites that have hosting, continuous deployment, and CDN without
any hassle. With Netlify Functions, I can go one step further; I can make my
React site a dynamic application using APIs. Their serverless Functions make
creating an API a breeze; I drop a javascript function in a folder, deploy, and
I have an API.</p>
<p>Serverless is great for its smaller upfront costs (for low traffic, you are
usually still in free tier range) and zero infrastructure management needs.
Pay-as-you-go is a risk if you go too fast, but that’s not something I am
expecting. With Netlify Functions encapsulating the not that simple AWS Lambda
Functions, it has the extra bonus of keeping me away from the AWS Management
Console interface.</p>
<p>I have a fast CRUD app deployed in my domain, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<h3>Fauna</h3>
<p><a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> is a distributed NoSQL database that is very well
suited to plug into serverless applications. NoSQL, with its flexible schema, is
a blessing for building new projects that will change a lot and quickly. I am
not building a typical social network; I am implementing original ideas that
might or might not work, that have changed and will continue to change as my own
ideas evolve and I get users' feedback. The data structure will reflect that. I
am a Javascript developer; I like how javascript notates its objects; it is
easier for me to understand and change a JSON object. It is also the obvious
solution for going serverless.</p>
<p>I have a safe, reliable, and fast database, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<p><em>update: In the first version of this post I was using Userbase as
authentication solution. Since then, I decided to concentrate more on FaunaDB
tech, including their built-in user authentication.</em></p>
<h3>Putting everything to work</h3>
<p>Quid Sentio core entity is the journal entry. An entry can contain text, audio
recorded by the user, an image, a mood number selected from a range from -100 to
100, and custom tags. Each entry can also be shared and commented by friends.
This data looks like this for the user:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-01.png" alt="Text entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-02.png" alt="Audio entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-03.png" alt="Image entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-04.png" alt="Mood entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-05.png" alt="Tags entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-06.png" alt="Sharing entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-07.png" alt="Commenting entry screenshot"></p>
<p>The entry data is pretty suitable for a JSON structure, as I have to fit all of
these, with its inherent grouping, in one database item. Images and audios are
stored at AWS S3, their URLs are stored at the database item too.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that I can -- and I will -- add more types of content that
the user can add to an entry. Audio, image, and custom tags were all added after
I launched the alpha version. I still consider video, maybe stickers, or other
more creative inputs that I learn from my users. The flexibility of adding more
properties to an entry while keeping it backward-compatible comes much more
naturally to NoSQL.</p>
<p>Quid Sentio is also social. The user creates an entry in their journal and can
then choose with whom, among their friends, they want to share it and allow to
comment on it. The user will also view all of their friends’ entries that were
shared with them. Each entry contains its permissions of access and list of
comments.</p>
<p>I keep the user’s list of friends as one of the profile properties that I keep
in a "Users" collection in FaunaDB. After user authentication I can access it
and then I can keep it in the state of my application. It is basically a list of
userIds, so no big deal. The tricky thing is to make the request that returns
only the entries from those friends who are authorized to be seen by the user.</p>
<p>This is where FQL shines. FQL is FaunaDB’s own query language, but I could use
GraphQL (also supported by FaunaDB) with similar results. I can easily create a
query from a Netlify Function that only brings the authorized entries without
the need of writing a lot of code with the logic required to not expose
unauthorized entries to the client. So it ends up being pretty fast and simple
to get the user’s friends’ entries and show this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/screenshot-friends-entries.png" alt="Text entry screenshot"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I had many technical obstacles between me and the social network that I wanted
to build. Then modern services started to arrive, one by one, and, with more
ease than expected, I got it done. I create-react-apped an app, deployed with
Netlify, wrote Netlify functions for the basic operations, integrated with
Fauna's NoSQL serverless database, including its built-in user authentication,
inserted a Stripe handled checkout page and voilà. The only thing in front of me
now is my vision. And I have all my cognitive resources preserved to reach it.
Or to be consumed trying to write smart comments on Hacker News. Only time will
tell.</p>

<p>My brain basks in this planning process. It feels so productive, but it involves minimal mental effort.</p>
<p>Time and time again this cycle occurs. When it comes to getting down to real work, the euphoric rush fades. It turns out planning is easy and action is hard.</p>
<p>Before long, my interest dies down and it’s onto the next topic. And so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>This happened until I heard a story of two men learning to fish. The first fisherman heads to the marina and buys the best fishing boat money can buy. He specs out a custom carbon fiber rod and spends thousands on a deep-water GPS. He spends time reading up on different casting, reeling, and baiting techniques. A few months later, he feels ready to fish.</p>
<p>But by the time he casts his first line, the second fisherman has sucked the lake dry. </p>
<p>On day one, the second fisherman grabbed a shitty rod, sliced up a hot dog, and started fishing. Every day he honed his technique, finding bait which worked a little better or a spot that had a few more nibbles. After three weeks of iteration, he found the winning combo.</p>
<p>Before long, he was hauling in hundreds of fish every day. From there he opened a restaurant to sell his fresh fish. And then he opened a fishing school to teach others his craft. All while the first fisherman gathered gear.</p>
<p>The moral of this story?</p>
<p>Get to action as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong> When you find yourself gathering gear, grab a shitty rod and start fishing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a minimal static website and blog using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and deploy it on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. To goal is to start simple with a minimal set of features and add more functionality later as needed. I will also explain why I decided to use a static site generator and why I chose Pelican. If you are not interested in the first part, you can directly jump to the <a href="#how-to">How To section</a> of the tutorial.</p>

    </a></p><p>The I Want To Read More website generated with Pelican</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Why static site generator?</h2>
<p>When I <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog/building-a-product-in-the-open/">started building I Want To Read More</a> I wanted to launch a prototype quickly <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/building-the-prototype" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a>, so I could validate the idea. This meant avoiding as much complexity as possible. Using a static site generator and going serverless <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/buidling-serverless" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a> seemed like the best way to achieve this.</p>
<p>A static site generator uses template files to define the structure and design of the site. The content, like for example the blog posts, is stored separately, usually in Markdown format. When the generator builds the site, the final HTML files are generated by combining the templates and the content files. This allows you to avoid code duplication and to be able to focus on the content when writing. Many static site generators are explicitly focused on blogs.</p>
<p>The big advantage of statically generated sites is that their hosting is simple and cheap. The web server simply needs to serve the generated HTML pages. Compared to dynamic content management systems (CMS), like <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, static sites are safer, faster and consume less resources. That's why you can find many static site hosting providers that offer generous free plans like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">AWS S3</a>. Dynamic sites are usually either paid (<a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>) or offer a more limited free tier. For example, using the free plan, you cannot have a custom domain on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> and have very limited bandwidth on <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>.</p>
<p>Some more advanced features may be easier to implement in a CMS, like for example sophisticated publishing systems. Our goal here, though, is to get something up and running quickly and cheaply.</p>
<p>You will also need some technical knowledge to set everything up, but the effort is worth it. It this tutorial I will show you how you can remove a lot of the complexity in the process. I will also provide you with templates so you can create a simple site with a blog with minimal effort.</p>
<h2>Why I chose Pelican?</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of static site generators, so how do you choose one? My approach here was to go for one that is implemented in a language I'm already familiar with. While you will not need to write code to configure the generator, you will probably have some experiences with the tools of the particular language. I decided to go with a Python based static site generator, but here are some ideas for other languages as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python - <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>, <a href="https://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a></li>
<li>Ruby - <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.bridgetownrb.com/">Bridgetown</a>, <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a></li>
<li>JavaScript - <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing to consider is if the site generator has a particular focus. Some are more suitable for blogs, while other specialize in project documentation. Choose one that is suitable for your use case. For <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> it was important for me to be able to easily create static pages and a blog.</p>
<p>When choosing a framework, I like to choose a mature and popular project. Such projects have the advantage that there will be a big community and you will easily find solutions to common problems. If you need some specific feature, though, it may be worth checking some of the more specialized options.</p>
<p>I recommend checking <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>, which is a list of static site generators. You can filter the different projects by their programming language and compare them by popularity and specialization.</p>

    </a></p><p>Choosing a static site generator on StaticGen</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After I compared the different Python options, I decided to go with <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. Another popular Python generator is <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>, but it seems to be specialized for project documentation, instead on blogs. <a href="https://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a href="https://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a> had much less start on GitHub, which I find to be a good proxy for popularity.</p>
<p>In the next section, I will go through the steps that you need to do in order to create a minimal static site with a blog using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. I will also show you how to deploy the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> using the free plan.</p>

<h2>How to create a static site and a blog with Pelican?</h2>
<p>I found Pelican's default configuration and theme a bit overwhelming for a simple website. There are just too many features and options that you don't need in the beginning. So, I created a configuration that is stripped down to only the most important things. I personally like an iterative approach, where I quickly create something working end-to-end and build on top of it.</p>
<p>I went through the code of the default <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms"><code>notmyidea</code></a> theme and stripped it down as much as possible. You can find the code of my <code>minimal</code> theme in the <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/tree/minimalistic_pelican_site/website">here</a>. This is the branch where the basic website is created and you can use it as a template for creating your own. Note, that this branch was merged into <code>master</code> and deployed in production. This is really the code used for the <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read Mode</a> website.</p>

    </a></p><p>The minimal website code on GitHub</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>1. Install Pelican</h3>
<p>You can easily install Pelican with <code>pip</code>. You should also choose what markup language you want to use for your content. Pelican supports both <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, but I went with Markdown since I'm already familiar with it.</p>
<pre><code>pip install pelican markdown
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Create a Pelican project.</h3>
<p>After Pelican is installed, you can create a new project with the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> tool:</p>
<pre><code>pelican-quickstart
</code></pre>

<p>It will ask you several questions like website title, author and URL. You should answer yes to the generation of automation scripts, because they will be useful, when deploying on Netlify. The tool will also offer you configuration for different ways of uploading your website. I rejected all of them because the deployment on Netlify can be easily done when pushing to the git repository. Here is my log of setting up <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to pelican-quickstart v4.2.0.

This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.

Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files
needed by Pelican.

&gt; Where do you want to create your new web site? [.] .
&gt; What will be the title of this web site? I Want To Read More
&gt; Who will be the author of this web site? Vladimir Haltakov
&gt; What will be the default language of this web site? [en] en
&gt; Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., https://example.com   (Y/n) Y
&gt; What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) https://iwanttoreadmore.com
&gt; Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) n
&gt; What is your time zone? [Europe/Paris] 
&gt; Do you want to generate a tasks.py/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) Y
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using S3? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) n
</code></pre>

<p>The newly created Pelican site will contain several folders and files that form the skeleton of your site. The following are the most important:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>content</code> - this is where you put your blog articles. You can also add the images that you will include in your posts here.</li>
<li><code>themes</code> - here you have the <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja</a> template files that will be used to generate the HTML code as well as your static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript). There are many <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes#pelican-themes">predefined Pelican themes</a>, but you will probably want to create a specific one for your website. It is a good idea to start from an existing theme and modify it.</li>
<li><code>pelicanconf.py</code> - the main configuration file of your site. Here, you can set variables to configure the different Pelican features.</li>
<li><code>publishconf.py</code> - configuration that applies when building the site for publishing.</li>
<li><code>output</code> - the folder where all the generated files will be stored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Adapting the theme.</h3>
<p>At this stage, you can take my <code>minimal</code> theme as a basis and change it to fit your website. It is stripped down to the most important features and it will allow you to start quickly. You can get the code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/tree/minimalistic_pelican_site/website">here</a>. Below, I will describe how I created it.</p>
<h3>4. Disabling unneeded features.</h3>
<p>I first disabled the generation of several blog pages that I don't need, like for example the archives, tags, categories or authors pages. This can be done in the <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/8070dba10d73478866bda8ae64d898e0634de5cd/website/pelicanconf.py#L38"><code>pelicanconf.py</code></a> file.</p>
<pre><code># Disable unneeded blog features
ARCHIVES_SAVE_AS = ""
AUTHOR_SAVE_AS = ""
AUTHORS_SAVE_AS = ""
CATEGORY_SAVE_AS = ""
CATEGORIES_SAVE_AS = ""
TAGS_SAVE_AS = ""
</code></pre>

<p>Removing these pages means that you don't have to take care of designing the templates for them in your theme. You can of course enable them again later if needed.</p>
<h3>5. Adapting the templates.</h3>
<p>After removing most blog pages, there are only 3 templates that I needed to adapt to my website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/base.html"><code>base.html</code></a> - this template defines the structure of every page. It contains the common header, navigation bar and footer.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a> - this is your blog's index page, that contains a list of all your articles. While it is possible to have some featured articles on top, I removed them for now in order to keep things simple.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/article.html"><code>article.html</code></a> - this is the template used to render a blog post. It is a small wrapper around the actual text of the article coming from the Markdown files in the <code>content</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Creating static pages outside the blog.</h3>
<p>The default Pelican setup assumes that your website's index will be your blog's index page. However, for <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> I wanted to have a landing page that describes the product. The blog is available at <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog">https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog</a>.</p>
<p>To achieve this, you first need to create the template for your landing page …</p></div></div>

<p>With Software as a Service (SaaS) spawning an entire cottage industry of *aaS, it is fair to wonder if some Silicon Valley startup with try and market themselves as becoming a Farming as a Service operation. One key problem is…FaaS has basically been around for decades, albeit with a less slick name: custom farming. </p>



<p>“Custom Farming” is basically an umbrella term for any operation a producer pays for or offers service for in addition to their own operation. Its so ubiquitous that Universities in the Midwest routinely take <a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/html/a3-10.html">surveys</a> to track pricing and monitor changes over years. Need someone to plant a field for you because you are overextended? According to the linked survey, you will look to pay around ~$25 depending on various options.  Agriculture in the U.S. is not in need of a FaaS startup to disrupt the status quo because a very healthy market already exists. As a plus for farmers (and a hindrance to founders looking for walled-garden approaches), the market is very transparent with several Universities publishing annuals surveys to reflect local fluctuations.</p>



<p>That said, the friction could be improved. With most things having an online presence and as farming communities becoming less face-to-face, perhaps an online (and real-time) marketplace connecting people who want work done posting bids and people who can work posting asks for various calendar-dependent activities. One way SV businesses to connect with the Midwest would be Imagery As a Service (IaaS). Farmers have access to drones and satellite imagery from seed and chemical companies (often at a cost $$$), but these seed and chemical companies have access to the same satellite and imagery systems as SV does (I am not aware of an agriculture company launching their own satellite with proprietary sensors). Working with imagery is a well honed skill for many data scientists and automating it into some sort of IaaS for farmers may be an interesting startup or side hustle. </p>



<p>How cool would it be to just upload some GPS coordinates for a field, pay $5 and get the <em>literal</em> most up-to-date image without driving out to the field (although half the fun of farming <em>is</em> going to the field!)? So if you see a startup marketing itself as FaaS, just know that has already been done and all you are paying for is added overhead!</p>

					<p>Ever tried dealing with a large company, only to get stonewalled? You're talking to a black box that repeats “Sorry, that’s against policy” or “I can’t do that”</p><p>But if you can open up that box the picture changes. The moving pieces become visible. Watch how each one ticks, and you’ll start noticing the systems at play.</p><p>Leaders design incentives to be armor plating for the company, protecting its interests. They work well for the most part, but all plating has seams.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768">Dangerous Professional</a> finds those seams and slips between them. &nbsp;They'll dodge gatekeepers and dance around policies, doing whatever it takes to get the job done.</p><p>Companies setup divisions with the job of managing all the incoming complaints. You know them as customer service. &nbsp;Depending on whether you’re that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy">company’s customer or their product</a>, customer service’s role varies from “keep them happy with minimal effort” to “get these people off our backs.” They’re the ones companies want you to contact.</p><p>When customer service isn’t being that helpful, look for someone else to complain to. Like the CEO.</p><p>Jeff Bezos is famous for reading all customer emails sent directly to him. When a complaint lands in his inbox he forwards it to one of his reports with just a question mark added: ‘?’. Whenever anyone gets this email <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/5-years-later-jeff-bezos-just-confirmed-jeff-bezos-question-mark-method-that-scares-heck-out-of-everyone-at-amazon-heres-how-it-works.html">they drop everything and scramble</a> to solve that customer’s problem. The customer service department doesn’t have that kind of clout.</p><p>I witnessed this at Microsoft. The VP got a complaint and forwarded it down to his direct report.</p><p>Which got forwarded down again. And again. And again. Each level adding one more manager’s weight. Propelling it faster and faster and faster till it smashed into my team’s inbox at critical velocity. All hands on deck!</p><p>Why did &nbsp;this work? Look at what’s happening behind the scenes. Your message went to someone with just enough time to say "This might be important, I’ll delegate it to the relevant team." And it gets fast tracked through the chain of command</p><p>A funny bit of management psychology comes into play here: If your boss’s boss’s boss tells you to “look into this please,” it jumps to top of your priority list. Usually folks don’t bother to ask if it should be prioritized higher or lower than the large pile already on their plate.</p><p>Achievement unlocked: Teleport to front of line.</p><p>Many businesses have departments tasked with nothing but creating rules other departments must follow. Some of those rules get really weird:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m continuously amazed by how many people have to ask permission to buy a $50 book, yet are empowered to call a meeting that costs tens of thousands of dollars.</p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1103868678389420033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Once I was going on a business trip to help with a conference. My company had instituted a hotel budget of $250 per day. But this was a BIG conference. Hotel prices were jacked up, and only the sketchiest places met that price point.</p><p>The cheaper hotels were 30 minutes away, but then I’d blow the budget for uber rides. I asked if I'd have to cancel my conference trip.</p><p>Manager: “There’s not actually an uber limit”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I booked that distant hotel and took an uber everyday. Now here’s the kicker: the hotel + uber cost <em>more </em>than what I would have paid if I had gotten a hotel walking distance from the venue. But that’s too complicated for the finance department to write formal rules around. Imagine if they prevented people from getting a ride when it was <em>really </em>needed!</p><p>Thus the current policy was born.</p><p>It gets better. When you see the policy’s red lines drawn out, you can walk around them like Danny Ocean’s crew navigating a laser maze. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mr834Cs9ncs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Good sales reps know this and use it to push deals through. Patrick McKenzie <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1284404823572410369">offers an example</a>:</p><p><em>"Suppose you are selling a $100k product to a director who has $100k budgeted for it. You do the dance. Purchasing says they need a 10% discount because We're Big Enough To Always Demand One.</em></p><p><em>Three days later you submit the following: $100k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year of SaaS services. Comes out of software budget. $12k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year commitment to professional services. Comes out of consulting budget.</em></p><p><em>Purchasing is *extremely* likely to approve this."</em></p><p>Did the company hire people who couldn’t do basic math? Of course not.</p><p>They pay people who know <em>where their time will be most valuable</em>. Writing a policy that covers 95% of situations will take them 10 hours and saves the companies $XX millions of dollars. Writing policies to cover the remaining 5% will take ten times as long and only offer a tiny fraction of the savings. The cost/benefit analysis doesn’t work out.</p><p>If you learn what was left in that missing 5% you'll have the advantage.</p><p>Remember there is no “company.” All of the company’s decisions are actually individuals acting within their own set of incentives. The “company” is what emerges when those individual incentives interact with each other.</p><p>You don’t have to fight the entire company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/there-is-no-spoon.png" alt=""><figcaption>There is no company</figcaption></figure><p>Hidden incentives exist in your own company too. Is a team resisting doing something you’re asking for? Learn why. Find the fulcrum point. New paths will emerge.</p><p>For example, I used to struggle with people not responding to my emails when I tried to get their approval on a change I was making. “People are busy,” my manager explained. “Instead say, ‘I’ll be making this change on Thursday unless you object before then.’” </p><p>I started doing that.</p><p>The objections were rare. The complaints, non-existent.</p><div><p>You get the best results when you adapt your approach to the person you’re facing</p><p>Now replace "person" with "team" or "department"</p><p>The sentence remains true</p></div><p>Figuring out each team's incentives can <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer#research-like-a-detective">take some detective work</a>. But once you understand them you’ll learn what makes each group tick. As you get better at this you’ll find yourself able to collaborate with others much more effectively and Get Stuff Done.</p>

		<p><em>See <a href="https://www.ollielovell.com/ollielearns/spaced-repetition-incremental-reading-anki-dendro/">this post</a> on how I now combine spaced repetition software with incremental reading software to supercharge my learning! If you haven’t heard of Anki before you may like to read my intro to it <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/tot/spaced-repetition-software-the-most-efficient-way-to-remember-anything/">here</a>, how I’ve been using it in my classes <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/olliesclassroom/instructional-approach-2017/">here</a>, or the previous post in this series on Anki advanced use <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/edtech/anki2/">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>Cloze deletion is a highly effective way of studying content, and making flash cards.</p>
<p>Imagine there’s a question that you would like to be able to remember and recall.</p>
<blockquote><p>in 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first artificial satellite, the Sputnik 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cloze deletion allows you to set up Anki cards where some of the key information is blanked out, and your job is to retrieve it. The above sentence could end up looking like this in a cloze deletion card.</p>
<blockquote><p>In ____, the&nbsp;____________ launched the world’s first artificial satellite, the ___________.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1, Simple cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1392166854">Cloze Deletion Single Card</a>&nbsp;Anki add-on. this allows you to make simple, single cards. Sometimes you might want to have multiple cloze deletions in a single card, or make different cloze deletions appear for different cards, based upon the same core phrase or piece of information. The following video clearly shows how to do this. <span id="more-1818"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRY1rYxd9EM?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Method 2, Cloze deletion and type the answer</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you might want to ensure that you know how to spell the missing words correctly (e.g., Sputnik vs. Sputnic), in this case, it could be helpful to set up anki so that you have to&nbsp;<em>type</em> the answer in. The following video shows you how to do this.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Before you edit the card template (i.e., type in the code) it’s important that you clone the ‘cloze’ card type, otherwise you’ll modify all cloze deletion cards that you have. I’ve included some screenshots at the bottom of this post to show you how to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>, The code given by the person in the video isn’t complete. See the info and the screenshot below this vid to see how exactly to set it up.</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnrigOzpJQo?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the front you should have: {{cloze:Text}}&lt;br&gt;{{type:cloze:Text}}</p>
<p>On the back you should have:&nbsp;{{cloze:Text}}&lt;br&gt;{{type:cloze:Text}}{{Extra}}</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1829"><img src="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-03-10 at 3.57.29 pm" width="592" height="535" srcset="https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png 592w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm-300x271.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 3, Image Occlusion for cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, such as when you are using info from slides and you’re having issues with the formatting of mathematical equations and the like, it may be better off to just take a screenshot of the info and create cloze deletions from the image itself. This would be helpful if you were trying to remember a list of info, such as is demonstrated in the following.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1819"><img src="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png" alt="Ollie Lovell, Oliver Lovell, Anki, Cloze deletion" width="732" height="371" srcset="https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png 732w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion-300x152.png 300w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion-624x316.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px"></a></p>
<p>In a case like this you can use the<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094"> image occlusion enhanced</a> add-on, as demonstrated in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYAMkwBdOas?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can just include the formula part as a screenshot, and use the cloze deletion function on the screenshot. Anki has no issue using cloze deletion on the images : )</p>
<p><strong>Method 4, Cloze Overlapper (more detailed and complex)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/969733775">TheCloze Overlapper</a>&nbsp;Anki addon is good for longer lists of info. A great tutorial video for this is shown below. Happy studying!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<!-- To a functional programmer like me, every programming language is a functional language. --> 

<p>Functional programming is a style of programming and modern languages support this style to a greater or lesser extent. In this article I want to explain how programming in a functional style provides you with powerful abstractions to make your code cleaner. I will illustrate this with examples in Raku and Python, which as we will see are both excellent languages for functional programming.</p>

<h2>Raku: a quick introduction</h2>

<p>The code examples in this article are written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>. I assume most people are familiar with Python, but Raku is less well known, so I will explain the basics first. The code in this article is not very idiomatic so you should be able to understand it easily if you know another programming language.</p>

<p>Raku is most similar to <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>. Both languages are syntactically similar to C/C++, Java and JavaScript: block-based, with statements separated by semicolons, blocks demarcated by braces, and argument lists in parentheses and separated by commas. The main feature that sets Perl and Raku apart from other languages is the use of sigils ('funny characters') which identify the type of a variable: <code>$</code> for a scalar, <code>@</code> for an array, <code>%</code> for a hash (map) and <code>&amp;</code> for a subroutine. Variables also have keywords to identify their scope, I will only use <code>my</code> which marks the variable as lexically scoped. A subroutine is declared with the <code>sub</code> keyword, and subroutines can be named or anonymous:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>square</span> (<span>$x</span>) {
    <span>$x</span>*<span>$x</span>;
}
<span># anonymous subroutine </span>
<span>my</span> <span>$anon_square</span> = <span>sub</span> (<span>$x</span>) {
    <span>$x</span>*<span>$x</span>;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python this would be:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>square</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span>

<span># anonymous subroutine </span>
<span>anon_square</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<!-- Raku also has [twigils](https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-Twigil), secondary sigils that influence the scoping of a variable. For this article, the only twigil used in the code is `.` which is used to declare a role or class attribute with automatically generated accessors (like `$.notes` in the example below). -->

<p>Raku supports sigil-less variables, and uses the <code>\</code> syntax to declare them. For more on the difference between ordinary and sigil-less variables, see <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Sigilless_variables">the Raku documentation</a>. For example (<code>say</code> prints its argument followed by a newline):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>x</span> = <span>42</span>; <span># sigilless</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$y</span> = <span>43</span>; 
<span>say</span> <span>x</span> + <span>$y</span>; 
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the code in this article, I will use the sigil-less variables whenever possible.</p>

<p>Raku has several types of sequence data structures. In the code below I will use <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/list">lists and arrays</a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Range">ranges</a>. The main difference between a list and an array in Raku is that a list is immutable, which means that once created, it can't be modified. So it is a read-only data structure. To 'update' an immutable data structure, you need to create an updated copy. Arrays on the other hand are mutable, so we can update their elements, extend them, shrink them etc. All updates happen in place on the original. </p>

<p>Raku's arrays are similar to Python's lists and Raku's lists are similar to Python's tuples, which are also immutable. Apart from the syntax, ranges in Raku are similar to ranges in Python, and both are immutable.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>@array1</span> = <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>; <span>#=&gt; an array because of the '@' sigil</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>array2</span> = [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>]; <span>#=&gt; an array, because of the '[...]'</span>

<span>my</span> \<span>range1</span> = <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>; <span>#=&gt; a range 1 .. 10</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@array3</span> = <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>; <span>#=&gt; an array from a range, because of the '@' sigil</span>

<span>my</span> \<span>list1</span> = <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>; <span>#=&gt; a list</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$list2</span> = (<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>); <span>#=&gt; also a list</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>list3</span> = |(<span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>);  <span>#=&gt; an array from a range because of the '|' flattening operation</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The equivalent Python code would be</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>list1</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>))</span> <span>#=&gt; a list from a tuple</span>
<span>list2</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>];</span> <span>#=&gt; a list, because of the '[...]'</span>

<span>range1</span> <span>=</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; a range 1 .. 10</span>
<span>list3</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>));</span> <span>#=&gt; a list from a range</span>

<span>tuple1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>#=&gt; a tuple</span>
<span>tuple2</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>])</span> <span>#=&gt; a tuple from a list</span>
<span>tuple3</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>))</span> <span>#=&gt; creates a tuple from a range</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Other specific bits of syntax or functionality will be explained for the particular examples. </p>

<h2><em>A function, by any other name</em> — functions as values</h2>

<p>Functions are the essence of functional programming. As I explained in my article <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/everything-is-a-function">"Everything is a function"</a>, in a proper functional language, all constructs are built from functions. </p>

<p>All modern programming languages have a notion of functions, procedures, subroutines or methods. They are an essential mechanism for code reuse.
Typically, we think of a function as something that operates on some input values to produce one or more output values. The input values can be globally declared, attributes of a class or passed as arguments to the function. Similarly, the output values can be returned directly, to global variables, as class attributes or by modifying the input values. </p>

<p>To benefit most from functional programming, it is best if functions are <em>pure</em>, which means that a call to the function always produces the same output for the same inputs. In practice, this is easier to achieve if the function only takes inputs as arguments and returns the output directly, but this is not essential.</p>

<p>The crucial feature of functional programming is that the input and output values of a function <em>can themselves be functions</em>. So functions must be values in your language. Sometimes this is called "functions must be first-class", and a function that takes and/or returns a function is sometimes called a "higher-order function". </p>

<p>If functions are values, it follows that we can assign them to variables. In particular we will assign them to the arguments of other functions. But we can also assign them to ordinary variables. </p>

<p>Let's consider the following function, <code>choose</code>, which takes three arguments <code>t</code>, <code>f</code> and <code>c</code>. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>choose</span> (\<span>t</span>, \<span>f</span>, \<span>d</span>) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>d</span>) {<span>t</span>} <span>else</span> {<span>f</span>}
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>def</span> <span>choose</span> <span>(</span><span>t</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>d</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>t</span> 
  <span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>First let's call <code>choose</code> with strings as values for the first two arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>tstr</span> = <span>"True!"</span>;
<span>my</span> \<span>fstr</span> = <span>"False!"</span>;

<span>my</span> \<span>res_str</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>tstr</span>, <span>fstr</span>, <span>True</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>res_str</span>; <span>#=&gt; says "True!"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>tstr</span> <span>=</span> <span>"True!"</span>
<span>fstr</span> <span>=</span> <span>"False!"</span>

<span>res_str</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tstr</span><span>,</span><span>fstr</span><span>,</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>res_str</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "True!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let's try with functions as arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>tt</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"True {s}!"</span> }
<span>sub</span> <span>ff</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"False {s}!"</span> }

<span>my</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>&amp;tt</span>, <span>&amp;ff</span>, <span>False</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span>; <span>#=&gt; says &amp;ff</span>
<span>res_f</span>(<span>"rumour"</span>); <span>#=&gt; says "False rumour!"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>def</span> <span>tt</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"True "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>ff</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>  
  <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"False"</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span>

<span>res_f</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tt</span><span>,</span><span>ff</span><span>,</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>res_f</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says &lt;function tt at 0x7f829c3aa310&gt;</span>
<span>res_f</span><span>(</span><span>"rumour"</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "False rumour!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So our function <code>choose</code> took two functions as its first two arguments, and returned a function. In Raku we need the <code>&amp;</code> sigil on the function names because otherwise they would be evaluated: a bare function name like <code>tt</code> is the same as calling the function without arguments, <code>tt()</code>. By assigning this function to a variable (<code>res_f</code>), we can now call <code>res_f</code> as a function and it will eventually call <code>tt</code> or <code>ff</code> depending of the choice.</p>

<h2>Functions don't need a name</h2>

<p>Now, if we can assign functions to variables, they don't really need a name themselves. So our functions can be anonymous. Most languages support anonymous functions. In functional languages they are usually called <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/everything-is-a-function/">"lambda functions"</a>. In Raku, we have two ways to create anonymous functions:</p>

<p>Using the <code>sub (...)</code> syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>tt</span> = <span>sub</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"True {s}!"</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or using the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#index-entry-pointy_blocks">'pointy block' syntax</a>, which is a little bit more compact:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>ff</span> = -&gt; \<span>s</span> { <span>say</span> <span>"False {s}!"</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>Python uses the <code>lambda</code> keyword:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>tt</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>s</span> <span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"True "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span> <span>)</span>
<span>ff</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>s</span> <span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"False "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So now we can say</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>tt</span>, <span>ff</span>, <span>True</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span>; <span>#=&gt; says sub { }</span>
<span>res_f</span>(<span>"story"</span>); <span>#=&gt; says "True story!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we print out the variable to which the function is bound, Raku returns <code>sub { }</code> to indicate that the variable contains a function.</p>

<p>In Python:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>res_f</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tt</span><span>,</span> <span>ff</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>res_f</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says &lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x7f829b298b80&gt;</span>
<span>res_f</span><span>(</span><span>"story"</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "True story!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Examples: <code>map</code>, <code>grep</code> and <code>reduce</code></h2>

<p>Functions of functions have many uses, and I just want to highlight three examples that are available readily in Raku: <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>grep</code>. Python has <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>, and provides <code>reduce</code> via the <code>functools</code> module. What these functions have in common is that they offer an alternative to <code>for</code>-loops over lists.</p>

<h3><code>map</code> : applying a function to all elements of a list</h3>

<p><code>map</code> takes two arguments: a function and a list. It applies the function to all values in the list in order and returns the results, for example to square all values in a list:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = <span>map</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {<span>x*x</span>} , <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python we need to explicitly create the tuple, but apart from the syntax differences, the structure is quite the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the functional alternative to the more conventional <code>for</code>-loop:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = [];
<span>for</span> <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {
    <span>res</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>x*x</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>):</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that in both Raku and Python we need to use a mutable data structure for the <code>for</code>-loop version, whereas the <code>map</code> version uses immutable data structures.</p>

<h3><code>grep</code> : filtering a list</h3>

<p><code>grep</code> (called <code>filter</code> in Python) also takes arguments, a function and a list, but it only returns the values from the list for which the function returns <code>true</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = <span>grep</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> { <span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span> }, <span>1</span> .. <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>,</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can of course write this using a <code>for</code>-loop and an <code>if</code>-statement, but that again requires a mutable data structure:  </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = [];
<span>for</span> <span>1</span> .. <span>30</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span>) {
    <span>res</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>x</span>);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>):</span> 
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>):</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What's nice about <code>map</code> and <code>grep</code> is that you can easily chain them together:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>grep</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> { <span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span> }, <span>map</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {<span>x*x</span>}, <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>30</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>,</span><span>map</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>,</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>))))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is because <code>map</code> and <code>grep</code> take a list and return a list, so as long as you need to operate on a list, you can do this by chaining the calls.</p>

<h3><code>reduce</code> : combining all elements of a list into a single value</h3>

<p><code>reduce</code> also takes a function and a list, but it uses the function to combine all elements of the list into a single result. So the function must take two arguments. The <em>second</em> argument is the element taken from the list, and the first argument is used as a state variable to combine all …</p></div></div>

"""

Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos—states of dynamical systems whose apparently-random states of disorder and irregularities are often governed by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions). A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements or due to rounding errors in numerical computation, can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This can happen even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution and is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:

"Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future."

Chaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, including fluid flow, heartbeat irregularities, weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as the stock market and road traffic. This behavior can be studied through the analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps. Chaos theory has applications in a variety of disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, physics, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, biology, ecology, pandemic crisis management, and philosophy. The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as complex dynamical systems, edge of chaos theory, and self-assembly processes.

<p>Artificial intelligence is one of the most talked-about topics in the tech landscape due to its potential for revolutionizing the world. Many thought leaders of the domain have spoken their minds on artificial intelligence at various occasions in different parts of the world. Today, we will list down the top&nbsp;quotes on artificial intelligence&nbsp;that have an in-depth meaning and are/were ahead of time.</p>



<p>Here is the list of&nbsp;top quotes about artificial intelligence: –</p>



<h3><strong>Quote On Artificial Intelligence By Stephen Hawking</strong></h3>



<blockquote><p>“Success in creating effective AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don’t know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it. Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy.”</p><cite>Stephen Hawking, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stephen Hawking’s&nbsp;quotes on artificial intelligence&nbsp;are very optimistic. Some of the famous quotes on artificial intelligence came from Hawking in 2014 when the BBC interviewed him. He said artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.</p>

<h3>Elon Musk On Artificial Intelligence</h3>



<blockquote><p>I have been banging this AI drum for a decade. We should be concerned about where AI is going. The people I see being the most wrong about AI are the ones who are very smart, because they can not imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them. That’s the flaw in their logic. They are just way dumber than they think they are.</p><cite>Elon Musk, 2020</cite></blockquote>



<p>Musk has been very vocal about artificial intelligence’s capabilities in changing the way we do our day-to-day tasks. Earlier, he had stressed on the fact that AI can be the cause for world war three. In his Tweet, Musk mentioned ‘it [war] begins’ while quoting a news, which noted Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, though on the ruler of the world; the president said the nation that leads in AI would be the ruler of the world.</p>

<h3>Mark Zuckerberg’s Quote</h3>



<p>Unlike negative quotes on artificial intelligence by others, Zuckerberg does not believe artificial intelligence will be a threat to the world. In his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10103911836230631/?t=1031">Facebook live</a>, Zuckerberg answered a user who asked about people like Elon Musk’s opinion about artificial intelligence. Here’s what he said:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I have pretty strong opinions on this. I am optimistic. I think you can build things and the world gets better. But with AI especially, I am really optimistic. And I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios. I just don’t understand it. It’s really negative and in some ways, I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.”</p><cite>Mark Zuckerberg, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<h3>Larry Page’s Quote</h3>



<blockquote><p>“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We’re nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.”</p><cite>Larry Page</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stepped down as the CEO of Alphabet in late 2019, Larry Page has been passionate about integrating artificial intelligence in Google products. This was evident when the search giant announced that the firm is moving from ‘Mobile-first’ to ‘AI-first’.</p>



<h3>Sebastian Thrun’s Quote On Artificial Intelligence</h3>



<blockquote><p>“Nobody phrases it this way, but I think that artificial intelligence is almost a humanities discipline. It’s really an attempt to understand human intelligence and human cognition.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Sebastian Thrun</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sebastian Thrun is the co-founder of Udacity and earlier established Google X — the team behind Google self-driving car and Google Glass. He is one of the pioneers of the self-driving technology; Thrun, along with his team, won the Pentagon’s 2005 contest for self-driving vehicles, which was a massive leap in the autonomous vehicle landscape.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tesla.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a>, the world’s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles, accused and filled a suit against its electric vehicle automaker rivals —&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://rivian.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivian</a>.</p>



<p>According to Tesla, Rivian is stimulating employees of Tesla to leave their job and encouraging them to pouch the company’s trade secrets, confidential, and property information while leaving the firm.</p>



<p>Tesla also indicted Rivian by alleging that the rival startup has already recruited four of its employees who stole highly sensitive information while leaving. The largest automaker mentioned in the new suit that a total of 178 former Tesla employees are working at Rivian. And of which around 70 of them directly joined the rival startup.</p>

<p>While Tesla is blaming its rival, Rivian defended itself with a statement to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tesla-takes-aim-at-rivian-in-lawsuit-alleging-trade-secret-theft-poaching-talent/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Crunch</a>: “We admire Tesla for its leadership in resetting expectations of what an electric car can be. Rivian is made up of high-performing, mission-driven teams, and our business model and technology are based on many years of engineering, design and strategy development. This requires the contribution and know-how of thousands of employees from across the technology and automotive spaces. Upon joining Rivian, we require all employees to confirm that they have not, and will not, introduce former employers’ intellectual property into Rivian systems. This suit’s allegations are baseless and run counter to Rivian’s culture, ethos and corporate policies.”</p>



<p>With investments from Amazon and Ford, Rivian is a significant player in the electric vehicle industry and had bagged high-profile deals from Amazon. The largest e-commerce company has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian, which are yet to be delivered by the Tesla rival. R.J Scaringe founded Rivian in the year 2009, and today the company has footprints in many countries such as Canada, California, Plymouth, Normal, San Jose, United Kingdom, and more.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Tesla alleged that its employees steal sensitive information and leave the company and joined rivals organizations such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.xiaopeng.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xpeng Motors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://zoox.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoox Inc</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It must have been about a year ago, just after I moved from San Francisco here to New York. I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.</p>



<p>Going back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.</p>



<p>Most career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).</p>



<p>After Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 – $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.</p>



<p>Further on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000.&nbsp; For comparison’s sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour…</p>



<p>Moreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hour of the day than the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup>. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.</p>



<p>Of course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.</p>



<p>Once in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like “I feel like I have never worked a day in my life” or “If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now”. Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary.</p>

<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript-heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

Apple in a support bulletin said that using tapes/physical covers could eventually degrade the webcam and damage the MacBook display.

Apple may have its reasons to warn MacBook users, but Librem Linux smartphones and laptop makers don’t like Apple’s advice. In a <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/apple-has-no-tolerance-for-webcam-covers/">blog post</a>, Purism Chief Security Officer, Kyle Rankin says Apple’s advice is ‘discouraging’ from a security point of view.

While Purism offers users <strong>Kill Switches</strong> to kill their microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, etc. and be in control, Apple wants to be the sole security custodian for such services. “Apple and Purism take completely different approaches to security. Apple’s approach is to require customers to hand over all trust and control to Apple and depend upon Apple for all of their security. Purism’s approach is to give customers control over their own computers and provide security without depending upon Purism. Webcam security is a great lens through which to view these completely opposite approaches,” Rankin adds, “In the end, your privacy and your computer should belong to you, not the vendor that sold it.”</p><p>Purism is a Linux hardware maker and sells Linux smartphones, tablets, and laptops under the Librem brand. All Librem devices are designed to protect privacy and freedom by avoiding the Intel Active Management Technology. All Librem laptops feature hardware kill switches for the microphone, webcam, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>Python web scraping is a field where you can collect data from online web pages. For many different purposes. Mostly for data mining for data analysis, data science and machine learning. However there are so many use cases for web scraping. </p>



<p>Web scraping is a bit of a dark art in the sense, that with great power comes great responsibility. Use what you learn in this tutorial only to do ethical scraping. In this python web scraping tutorial, we will scrape the worldometer website for some data on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Then do something with that data. Since this is a web scraping tutorial we will mainly be focusing on the scraping portion and only very little be touching on the data processing side of the tutorial.</p>



<p>We will be using a python library called <strong>beautifulsoup </strong>for our web scraping project. It is important to note that beautiful soup isn’t the silver bullet in web scraping. </p>



<p>It mainly is a wrapper for a parse which makes it more intuitive and simpler to extract data from markup like HTML and XML. If you are looking for something which can help you navigate pages. </p>



<p>Also be able to crawl websites then beautiful soup won’t do that on it’s own. However it is good to note that there are other options such as <strong>python scrapy</strong> as well. There will later on be a tutorial on scrapy as well. </p>



<p>Then you can actually decide which is the best for your particular project or use case. Before we can get started let us start by installing beautifulsoup. So for this we will need to create a virtual environment. </p>



<p>If you are using windows, mac, Linux the procedure should be very similar. So here we go:</p>



<h2>Python beautifulsoup: installation</h2>



<p>Let us create a virtual environment for our project. So if you are on windows open a powershell or cmd prompt. If on mac or linux open up a terminal and execute the following commands.</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">python -m virtualenv bsenv</code></pre>



<p>Where bsenv will be the folder where our virtual environment will be. You can now run:</p>



<p>Windows:</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">.\bsenv\Scripts\activate</code></pre>



<p>Linux/Mac:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">source bsenv/bin/activate</code></pre>



<p>This should now activate your virtual environment like this and we can now install beautifulsoup.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-39.png" alt="python web scraping beautifulsoup installation virtualenv" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-39.png"></figure>



<p>Run this to install on linux/mac/windows:</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests</code></pre>



<p>To test that beautifulsoup is installed. Run a python terminal and import beautifulsoup like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-40.png" alt="python web scraping beautifulsoup installation" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-40.png"></figure>



<p>If that worked for you then great you are installed! Let us now start with the most basic example. </p>



<h2>Beautifulsoup: HTML page python web scraping / parsing</h2>



<p>So here is an HTML example we will work with to just start with. So go ahead and paste this into your favorite editor and save it as <strong>index.html</strong>.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Joe&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Suzanne&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Jane&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;69&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
       
    &lt;/table&gt;
    
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Once you have saved that. Create a new python script called: scrape.py.  Here is the code we going to use to get some info from our index.html file.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
data = open("index.html").read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')

print(soup.title.text)</code></pre>



<p>This very basic bit of code will grab the title tag text from our index.html document. This is how the output will look if you run it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-41.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-41.png"></figure>



<p>Let’s now try do something a little more complicated like grabbing all the tr tags. Then displaying all the names in the tags.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
data = open("index.html").read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')

trs = soup.find_all('tr')

for tr in trs:
    td = tr.findChildren("td")
    
    if not td: 
        continue
    print(td[0].text)</code></pre>



<p>Your output should look something like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-42.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-42.png"></figure>



<p>To explain how this code works. We are loading up the html with a basic file read in python. We then instantiate the BeautifulSoup parser with our html data. We then do a find_all on all the tr tags.</p>



<p>I then loop over all the trs and find all the td children. If the td children don’t exist we skip over this item. Then finally we just get the first element and print the text contained in those tags.</p>



<p>So, so far so good pretty simple right. Let’s now look at getting some data using a request. The url we will be using to get some data is: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</p>



<h2>Python web scraping: From a web page url</h2>



<p>To be able to load up the html from the web page we will use the requests library in python and then feed that data to beautiful soup. Here is the code.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = requests.get('https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/').text

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
data_table = soup.find('table', id='main_table_countries_today')
rows = data_table.find_all('tr')
datalist = []
for row in rows:
    rowlist = []
    
    try:
        tds = row.find_all('td')
        for td in tds:
            rowlist.append(td.text)
        datalist.append(','.join(rowlist))
    except:
        pass
print('\n'.join(datalist))</code></pre>



<p>So if you run this it will output a csv set of data for us will be generated like this which we can use for some data analysis or maybe even some type of other data source. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-43.png" alt="beautiful soup requests data" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-43.png"></figure>



<p>Here is how the code works. So first thing is we import requests, so that we can make web requests using our python script. We then call requests.get to get the url and at the end choose to get the text version of the data. </p>



<p>So that we get the raw html data. Next we add this to our BeautifulSoup object and use the html.parser. Then we select a table with the id=main_table_countries_today. </p>



<p>How we find this is you will open the page in your chrome or firefox browser head over to the table, then right click and select the inspect option. </p>



<p>If you have done this you should be able to find this id main_table_countries_today. So once we have that we will use data_table variable we just created. Which will now contain the data table element. </p>



<p>Then we simply do a find all to find all the tr elements in that table. Next we loop over all our rows and just initialize an empty rowlist to store our data in. After that we open a try except block, so that if any of the elements are missing in our data we won’t error out our script. </p>



<p>The try except will basically skip over the critical errors so our script can continue reading the html. In the try except we do a find all for all the td tags, then finally loop over them to add the columns to our rowlist.</p>



<p> Outside of that loop we join them on a comma. Then outside of that loop we add the row to our datalist and then finally outside of that loop we join our datalist rows to create a csv like print out of the data.</p>



<p>If you look at the code, that was pretty simple to just gather some basic table form data. Scraping like this needs to really be done carefully as you don’t want to overwhelm anyone’s server. </p>



<p>So once again this is only for educational purposes and what you do with this is at your own risk. However for basic scraping on your own websites which you own you can collect data etc.</p>



<p>If you are wanting to learn web scraping it is best to do as much of it offline, so you can rapidly test and don’t have to do a request to a server the whole time. </p>



<p>For that you can just save a particular web page using your browser and work on that html file locally.</p>



<p>Let us look at another example of some web scraping before we end off this tutorial.</p>



<h2>Python web scraping: creating a blog post feed</h2>



<p>So you may want to create a blog post feed. For whatever reason, maybe you are building an application. </p>



<p>Which needs to retrieve basic data from a blog post for a social sharing website. Then you can use beautifulsoup to parse some of this data.</p>



<p>To show you how this can work let us scrape some data from my own blog from the home page.</p>



<p>So we will use the url: https://generalistprogrammer.com</p>



<p>So for this I have saved the html page using my browser like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-44.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-44.png"></figure>



<p>I suggest if you want to follow along you should do the same. Please don’t do a request to my server in python. So save that as <strong>gp.html</strong>.</p>



<p>Now here is a pro tip. You might get this really strange error with this code.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = open('gp.html').read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())</code></pre>



<p>C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.8_3.8.1520.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\lib\encodings\cp1252.py”, line 23, in decode<br>return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0]<br>UnicodeDecodeError: ‘charmap’ codec can’t decode byte 0x8d in position 18403: character maps to</p>



<p>If you are getting this error, it is because our reader is not reading this as utf8. So to fix this we modify our code to look like this.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = open('gp.html',encoding='utf8').read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())</code></pre>



<p>So we basically just added encoding=’utf8′. Then when you run it you will get the output of the web page.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-45.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-45.png"></figure>



<p>So great you may have noticed I used the .prettify at the end that just makes this html more structured and easier to read using beautifulsoup. So let’s now follow the same procedure as before by using our inspector tool in chrome / firefox like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-46.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-46.png"></figure>



<p>That will open up the inspector tool like this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-47.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-47.png"></figure>



<p>So this helps us find the entry point for our scraper. So we want to look at all articles. Then you will notice the article tag slightly above this tag. So let’s start …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this blog post, we look at three approaches for eliminating duplicate objects from Arrays.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="eliminating-duplicates-from-arrays">Eliminating duplicates from Arrays&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Eliminating duplicate values from Arrays is simple – as long as the values are primitive (and therefore compared by value):</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> values = [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>, <span>'jane'</span>];
<span>const</span> uniqueValues = [...new <span>Set</span>(values)];
assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueValues,
  [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>]);
</code></pre>
<p>However, that approach doesn’t work with the following data because a Set would consider each object to be unique:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> members = [
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
  },
];
</code></pre>
<h2 id="approach-1%3A-building-a-new-array-without-duplicates">Approach 1: building a new Array without duplicates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code><span>const</span> uniqueMembers1 = [];

<span>for</span> (<span>const</span> m <span>of</span> members) {
  <span>if</span> (!containsMember(uniqueMembers1, m)) {
    uniqueMembers1.push(m);
  }
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>containsMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.find(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers1,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>We only add an object from <code>members</code> to <code>uniqueMembers1</code> if it doesn’t already exist in that Array. That’s why the earlier Jane with ID <code>'10yejma'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-2%3A-using-.filter()">Approach 2: using <code>.filter()</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers2 = members.filter(
  <span>(<span>m, index, ms</span>) =&gt;</span> getIndexOfMember(ms, m) === index);

<span><span>function</span> <span>getIndexOfMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.findIndex(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers2,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p><code>getIndexOfMember()</code> returns the first index where a member appears. We tell <code>.filter()</code> to only keep the members at those indices. That’s why the first Jane “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3%3A-a-map-from-unique-keys-to-members">Approach 3: a Map from unique keys to members&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueKeyToMember = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>(
  members.map(<span><span>m</span> =&gt;</span> [m.first+<span>'\t'</span>+m.last, m])); 
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers3 = [...uniqueKeyToMember.values()];

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers3,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>If an object that is added to the Map has the same unique key as a previous object, it replaces that object. That’s why the later Jane with ID <code>'1y15hhu'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h3 id="variants-of-approach-1-and-approach-2">Variants of approach 1 and approach 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We use a Set to record unique keys of members that we have visited. If the key of the current member is already in that Set, then we don’t push it (approach 1) or filter it out (approach 2).</p>
<p>This may help with large Arrays because we don’t have to search them. On the other hand, creating keys and maintaining a Set affects performance negatively.</p>

                                                        <p><strong>EU supports joint strategy for innovation in research and teaching with a total of five million euros</strong></p>

<p>The university network ENLIGHT is to become a European University. The EU will fund the network of nine research-intensive universities, among them the University of Göttingen, with five million euro for a three-year period. In the coming semester, the partners will begin implementing a joint strategy for innovation in research and higher education. ENLIGHT stands for <em>European university Network to promote equitable quality of Life, sustainability and Global engagement through Higher education Transformation</em>. The EU’s main aim behind the pilot call “European Universities” was to transform the European Higher Education sector. Twenty-four university networks were selected in the second round of this initiative.</p>

<p>“The goals we set ourselves within this consortium are highly ambitious, but I am convinced that this is the right way forward,” says Professor Reinhard Jahn, President of the University of Göttingen. “Even after years of European integration there are still obstacles to collaborative research and the Europeanisation of higher education. In order to tear down these remaining barriers, we need consortiums wherein we trust each other and can dare to experiment. I am proud that Göttingen is among the universities that will shape this reform process in Europe and look forward to tackling this challenge.”</p>

<p>In joint structures and through innovative teaching opportunities, the nine ENLIGHT universities will empower students with the right knowledge and skills to become engaged citizens and professionals and respond to the major, complex societal challenges of the 21st century.</p>

<p>“ENLIGHT is unique in its geographical, economic, social, cultural and linguistic diversity,” says Professor Hiltraud Casper-Hehne, Vice-President for Internationalisation at the University of Göttingen. “The dedicated and sustainable commitment to this goal has been worth it! We will now use this breadth and wealth to create new, flexible and international research and study opportunities tailored to everyone's individual needs. In so doing, we will lay the foundation for the next generation of genuine Europeans.”</p>

<p>"This is a great success for the University of Göttingen and its international partners," explains Björn Thümler, Minister for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony. "This award means that Lower Saxony is clearly placed on the map of European science. This is whole-hearted confirmation of our course to strongly focus on European initiatives. The support of the University of Göttingen in the application process has paid off.”</p>

<p>ENLIGHT unites the universities of the Basque Country, Bordeaux, Galway, Gent, Göttingen, Groningen, Tartu, Uppsala and Comenius University in Bratislava. Cross-border collaboration is as central to the joint strategy as a focus on the locality, where the partners intend to address societal challenges in a local context. ENLIGHT will pilot new learning formats across five focus themes: Climate Change, Health and Well-Being, Inequalities, Digital Revolution, Energy and Circularity. In these areas, students will engage with researchers, citizens and professionals from their communities. They will discuss problems and solutions, examine innovation potential and promote diversity. The exchange within the network will allow European solutions to emerge from these local contexts, and in this process, students will also be involved. This constitutes a completely new form of university education.</p>

<p>The ENLIGHT project was established in close collaboration with the student representatives of all ENLIGHT universities. The Student Network will continue to play a central role to meet the needs of current and future student generations.</p>

<p>ENLIGHT's ambition extends much further than the three-year project lifespan. In the long-term, ENLIGHT wants to create an open accessible space without barriers between the nine universities for researching, learning, teaching and working together. ENLIGHT intends to develop a model that not only applies within Europe, but also has a true impact worldwide and makes a substantial contribution to strengthen Europe's role in the world.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is going to outline the procedure for setting up a Haskell development environment.</p>

<p>This post differs from most posts around setting up a Haskell development environment in the sense that it does not directly jump into Cabal or Stack. Instead, it first provides some background information that makes it possible to understand the basics of the development environment in Haskell, the different moving parts, and how those come together in turning Haskell source code into an executable which can then be run.</p>

<!--end_excerpt-->

<p>A separate post will build on the information provided here and show how to make use of Stack or Cabal.</p>



<p>Haskell programs are compiled native executable binaries. Haskell programs are compiled. Software is written in Haskell, which by the way is a high-level programming language that is first converted into machine language which then gets executed. In this sense Haskell is different from languages like JavaScript and Python, which are interpreted language, but similar to languages like Java and Go, which are also compiled. It should be noted that it is also possible to run Haskell programs like an interpreted language. We get to this pretty soon, but most of the time, Haskell programs are compiled.</p>

<p>The Haskell compilation process produces native executive binaries. The keyword here is native. This means once a Haskell program is compiled, it does not need anything else to be able to run. This is similar to languages like Rust and Go, which also produce native executive binaries, but differ from languages like Java and C#, which requires a runtime to be first installed on the target computer before the compiled program can be executed.</p>

<p>The job of converting software written in a high-level programming language to machine language is done by a compiler. In the case of Haskell, the compiler is known as <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC (The Glasgow Haskell Compiler)</a>. Sometimes GHC is referred to as The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler or Glorious Haskell Compiler. GHC is not the only Haskell compiler in existence; others exist. Some other ones are <a href="https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc">UHC (Utrecht Haskell Compiler)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Lemmih/lhc">LHC (LLVM Haskell Compiler)</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Hugs">HUGS (Haskell User´s Gofer System)</a>. Even though other compilers exist, GHC has evolved to be the one true Haskell compiler, as it is by far the most used Haskell compiler. The other compilers are not as used or they are no longer supported. Haskell Wiki <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Implementations">lists</a> all the other compilers for Haskell.</p>

<p>To setup, a Haskell development environment is then essentially setting up GHC, and be able to use it to compile Haskell source code to executable binaries.</p>



<p>The method for getting GHC installed varies depending on the operating system and the installation methods. This post will only focus on the installation on macOS and Linux (Ubuntu).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are already familiar with Haskell, this is the point where you probably expect Cabal or Stack to be introduced. But on the contrary, Cabal/Stack won’t be mentioned yet. The idea is to install GHC without these tools in other to get a feeling of how things work behind the scenes. Doing this will also help appreciate the motivation for tools like Cabal and Stack exist within Haskell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For installation on macOS <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/"><code>ghcup</code></a> will be used while installation will be done using the Software repository on Ubuntu (Linux).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ghcup">What is ghcup</h2>

<p><code>ghcup</code> describes itself as the Haskell (GHC) toolchain installer. Similar in scope to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup">rustup</a> with Rust. It provides the mechanism to install all the necessary components required for developing Haskell. Together these components are sometimes referred to as the Haskell toolchain, of which GHC is a constituent.</p>



<p>Haskell toolchain is often used to refer to all the necessary components required for developing Haskell. It comprises of the compiler together with other auxiliary tools. As at the writing of this post, here is a list of what makes up the toolchain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GHC: The Haskell batch compiler. This is used for compiler source files into either libraries and executables.  Libraries are used as dependencies in other Haskell projects while executable are binaries that are run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GHCi: An interactive Haskell interpreter, which allows making use of GHC in an interactive environment. GHCi is what powers the Haskell REPL</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>runghc: A shell script that allows running Haskell as a script. Find more information on how to use <code>runghc</code> <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runghc.html">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>runhaskell: Similar to <code>runghc</code> but allows the ability to swap the Haskell compiler from <code>ghc</code> to something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Haddock: a tool for automatically generating documentation from annotated Haskell source code. See <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">here</a> for more information about Haddock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hp2ps: a profile tool for Haskell programs. See <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html">here</a> for more on how to use the Haskell profiler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hpc: a code coverage tool for Haskell programs. See <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_program_coverage">here</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hsc2hs: A preprocessor that helps with writing Haskell bindings to C code. See <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/utils.html#writing-haskell-interfaces-to-c-code-hsc2hs">here</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will like to note that the official download page is quite confusing. It refers to a Haskell platform which in reality no longer exists. It also presents 3 different classes of Haskell installation: Minimal Installation/Stack/Haskell Platform which is also really not the best representation of the process of installing Haskell. It is best to view installing Haskell as the process of getting the Haskell toolchain. This can be done by building from source, using a tool like <code>ghcup</code> or <code>Cabal</code> or <code>Stack</code>. The confusing state of the Download page is known, as can be seen from these two issues that have been created to resolve the problem: <a href="https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/issues/12">Download page is confusing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/pull/14">Download Page: Rearrangement of sections</a>. As of the writing of this post, these issues have not been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we know what the Haskell toolchain comprises of, let us look at some of the ways of getting it installed. First, we start by looking at how to install it on a Mac using <code>ghcup</code>.</p>



<p>There are a couple of ways to install <code>ghcup</code> but the most straightforward approach is to follow the instructions found at <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/</a>.</p>

<p>The installation process involves executing a command in the terminal and then following the prompts.</p>

<p>After installation is done, you will see a final prompt that may look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Installation is done!

To run `ghc` and cabal, you need to adjust your PATH variable.
You may want to source '/Users/schooloffp/.ghcup/env' in your shell
configuration to do so (e.g. ~/.bashrc).

Detected bash shell on your system...
If you want ghcup to automatically add the required PATH variable to "/Users/schooloffp/.bashrc"
answer with YES, otherwise with NO and press ENTER.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is about making the related binaries <code>ghcup</code> installed available in the terminal, so it is a good idea to type YES and have the <code>.bashrc</code> modified.</p>

<p>Note that on macOS, the <code>.bashrc</code> file is not run automatically. See this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/13019">stackoverflow answer</a>. This means the above process of <code>ghcup</code> modifying the <code>.bashrc</code> will not suffice to get the needed binary available in the terminal. There are a couple of ways to remedy this. One way, as also noted in the StackOverflow thread is to add <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> to the <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>

<p>Once this is done, you can then execute the installed binaries from the terminal. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.4

ghci --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.4

haddock --version
Haddock version 2.23.0, (c) Simon Marlow 2006
Ported to use the GHC API by David Waern 2006-2008

</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>An inquisitive reader would have also found that apart from the binaries listed as a constituent of the Haskell Toolchain, a cabal binary has also been installed as part of the <code>ghcup</code> installation process. This is indeed the case. <code>ghcup</code> also installs cabal, but we will ignore cabal for now and talk about it in subsequent posts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It should be noted that the above method of using <code>ghcup</code> to install the Haskell toolchain will also work on a Linux machine. The main objective of the installation process is to get necessary binaries unto the system, and most Linux distribution has a procedure for this already using their software package management. Hence it is also possible to use those to install the Haskell toolchain.</p>

<p>The only drawback is that most of the time, the Haskell version found in the official software repositories of most Linux distribution would be out of date.</p>

<p>At least that is the case with Ubuntu. Running the command below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> apt-cache policy haskell-platform
haskell-platform:
Installed: (none)
Candidate: 2014.2.0.0.debian4
Version table:
2014.2.0.0.debian4 500
500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe amd64 Packages
500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe i386 Packages
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Shows that the Debian package version found for Haskell is 2014.2.0.0.debian4. And if we find this on <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/haskell-platform/2014.2.0.0.debian4">Launchpad</a> we see this was uploaded 2016.</p>

<p>On installation by running <code>sudo apt-get install haskell-platform</code>, we can then check the version of <code>ghc</code> that is installed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.0.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This shows version 8.0.2. Even though, at the time of writing this post, the most recent version is 8.8.4</p>

<p>Therefore to get the latest Haskell Toolchain installed on Ubuntu, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ubuntu/ghc">hpv’s PPA</a> can be used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some background information about what PPA (Personal Package Archive) is, see <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA">Packaging/PPA</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding the PPA:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hvr/ghc
sudo apt-get update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Installing Haskell:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// sudo apt-get install ghc-x.y.z where x.y.z is the version to install

sudo apt-get install ghc-8.8.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the moment of writing this, even though 8.8.4 is the recent version, the latest version available via install via the PPA is version 8.8.3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The installation processes put the binaries in <code>/opt/ghc</code></p>



<p>Hence to have the binary available in the terminal, updating the path is one approach:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/ghc/bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After which the installation can …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

<p>Whenever you’re learning a new tool, you should first ask yourself two questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does this tool exist?</li>
<li>What problems does this tool solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can’t answer both of those questions, you may not need the tool in the first place. Let’s take those questions and apply them to webpack.</p>
<h3>Why does Webpack exist?</h3>
<p>At its core, webpack is a module bundler. It examines all of the <a href="https://ui.dev/javascript-modules-iifes-commonjs-esmodules/">modules</a> in your application, creates a dependency graph, then intelligently puts all of them together into one or more bundle(s) that your <code>index.html</code> file can reference.</p>
<div data-language="md"><pre><code>App.js ---&gt;     |         |
Dashboard.js -&gt; | Bundler | -&gt; bundle.js
About.js ---&gt;   |         |</code></pre></div>
<h3>What problem is webpack solving?</h3>
<p>Historically when building a JavaScript application, your JavaScript code would be separated by files (these files may or may not have been actual modules). Then in your <code>index.html</code> file, you’d have to include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to every JavaScript file you had.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>libs/react.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/admin.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/dashboard.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/api.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/auth.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/rickastley.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not only was this tedious, but it was also error-prone. There were the obvious issues like typos or forgetting to include a file, but more than that, the order of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags mattered. If you loaded a script that depended on React before loading the React script, things would break. Because webpack (intelligently) creates a bundle for you, both of those problems go away. You don’t have to worry about forgetting a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and you don’t have to worry about the order.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>dist/bundle.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we’ll soon see, the “module bundling” aspect is just one part of webpack. If needed, you’re also able to tell webpack to make certain transformations on your modules before adding them to the bundle. Examples might include transforming SASS/LESS to regular CSS or “modern JavaScript” to ES5 that the browser can understand.</p>
<h3>Installing webpack</h3>
<p>Assuming you’ve initialized a new project with npm, there are two packages you need to install to use webpack, <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<h3>webpack.config.js</h3>
<p>Once you’ve installed <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>, it’s time to start configuring webpack. To do that, you’ll create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file that exports an object. Naturally, this object is where all the configuration settings for webpack will go.</p>

<p>Remember, the whole point of webpack is to “examine all of your modules, (optionally) transform them, then intelligently put all of them together into one or more bundle(s)” If you think about that process, in order to do that, webpack needs to know three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The entry point of your application</li>
<li>Which transformations, if any, to make on your code</li>
<li>The location to put the newly formed bundle(s)</li>
</ol>
<h4>The entry point</h4>
<p>Whenever your application is composed of modules, there’s always a single module that is the entry point of your application. It’s the module that kicks everything off. Typically, it’s an <code>index.js</code> file. Something like this.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>index<span>.</span>js
  imports about<span>.</span>js
  imports dashboard<span>.</span>js
    imports graph<span>.</span>js
    imports auth<span>.</span>js
      imports api<span>.</span>js</code></pre></div>
<p>If we give webpack the path to this entry file, it’ll use that to create the dependency graph of our application (much like we did above, except… better). To do that, you add an <code>entry</code> property to your webpack config which points to your entry file.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4>Transformations with Loaders</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file, the next thing we need to tell it is what transformations to run on our code. To do this, we’ll use what are called “loaders”.</p>
<p>Out of the box, when webpack is building its dependency graph by examining all of your <code>import</code>/<code>require()</code> statements, it’s only able to process JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> auth <span>from</span> <span>'./api/auth'</span> 
<span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./utils/config.json'</span> 
<span>import</span> <span>'./styles.css'</span> 
<span>import</span> logo <span>from</span> <span>'./assets/logo.svg'</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>There’s a very good chance that you’re going to want your dependency tree to be made up of more than just JS and JSON files - i.e., you’re going to want to be able to import <code>.css</code> files, <code>.svg</code> files, images, etc, as we’re doing above. This is where “loaders” can help us out. The primary purpose of a loader, as the name suggests, is to give webpack the ability to process more than just JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<p>The first step to adding any loader is to download it. Because we want to add the ability to <code>import</code> <code>.svg</code> files in our app, we’ll download the <code>svg-inline-loader</code> from npm.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> svg-inline-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to add it to our webpack config. All of the information for your loaders will go into an array of objects under <code>module.rules</code>.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now there are two pieces of information we need to give webpack about each loader. First, the type of file we want to run the loader on (in our case, all <code>.svg</code> files). Second, the loader to use on that file type (in our case, <code>svg-inline-loader</code>).</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll have an object with two properties, <code>test</code> and <code>use</code>. <code>test</code> will be a regex to match the file path and <code>use</code> will be the name of the loader we want to use.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we’ll be able to import <code>.svg</code> files. What about our <code>.css</code> files though? Let’s add a loader for that as well. We’ll use the <code>css-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> css-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we can import <code>.svg</code> and <code>.css</code> files. However, there’s still one more loader we need to add to get our styles to work properly. Right now, because of our <code>css-loader</code>, we’re able to <code>import</code> <code>.css</code> files. However, that doesn’t mean those styles are being injected into the DOM. What we really want to do is <code>import</code> a CSS file then have webpack put all of that CSS in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the DOM so they’re active on the page. To do that, we’ll use the <code>style-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> style-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice, because we now have two loaders for our <code>.css</code> rule, we change <code>use</code> to be an array. Also, notice that we have <code>style-loader</code> before <code>css-loader</code>. This is important. Webpack will process those in reverse order. So <code>css-loader</code> will interpret the <code>import './styles.css'</code> line then <code>style-loader</code> will inject that CSS into the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we just saw with <code>style-loader</code>, loaders can do more than just allow you to <code>import</code> certain file types. They’re also able to run transformations on files before they get added to the final output bundle. The most popular is transforming “next generation JavaScript” to the JavaScript of today that browsers can understand using <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="nofollow">Babel</a>. To do this, you can use the <code>babel-loader</code> on every <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> babel-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>There are loaders for just about anything you’d need to do. You can check out the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/" rel="nofollow">full list here</a>.</p>
<h4>The output</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file and what loaders to use, the next thing we need to tell it is where to put the bundle it creates. To do this, you add an <code>output</code> property to your webpack config.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> path <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  output<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    path<span>:</span> path<span>.</span><span>resolve</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>'dist'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    filename<span>:</span> <span>'index_bundle.js'</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So the full process looks something like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>webpack grabs the entry point located at <code>./app/index.js</code>.</li>
<li>It examines all of our <code>import</code> and <code>require</code> statements and creates a dependency graph.</li>
<li>webpack starts creating a bundle, whenever it comes across a path we have a loader for, it transforms the code according to that loader then adds it to the bundle.</li>
<li>It takes the final bundle and outputs it at <code>dist/index_bundle.js</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>We’ve seen how you can use loaders to work on individual files before or while the bundle is being generated. Unlike loaders, plugins allow you to execute certain tasks <strong>after</strong> the bundle has been created. Because of this, these tasks can be on the bundle itself, or just to your codebase. You can think of plugins as a more powerful, less restrictive version of loaders.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<h4>HtmlWebpackPlugin</h4>
<p>Earlier we saw that the main benefit of webpack was that it would generate a single bundle for us that we could then use to reference inside of our main <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>What <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> does is it will generate this <code>index.html</code> page for us, stick it inside of the same directory where our bundle is put, and automatically include a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag which references the newly generated bundle.</p>
<p>So in our example, because we’ve told webpack to name the final bundle <code>index_bundle.js</code> and put it in a folder called <code>dist</code>, when <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> runs, it’ll create a new <code>index.html</code> file, put it in <code>dist</code>, and include a script to reference the bundle, <code>&lt;script src='bundle_index.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Pretty nice, right? Because this file is being generated for us by <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code>, even if we change the output path or …</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-sb-using-emfi/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-sb-using-emfi/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Our research during the last few years definitely points out our interest in <strong>Fault Injection (FI)</strong> attacks. We produced numerous publications, which we presented at both <em><strong>academic</strong></em> and <em><strong>security</strong></em> conferences. Among other research, we showed that <strong>FI</strong> is an effective technique for for <strong>bypassing Secure Boot</strong> (<a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2016/2016_BlackHat-EU_Bypassing-Secure-Boot-Using-Fault-Injection_NT-AS.pdf">2016</a>, <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_BlueHat-IL_Hardening-Secure-Boot-on-Embedded-Devices-for-Hostile-Environments_NT-AS-CM.pdf">2019</a> and <a href="https://raelize.com/upload//research/2019/2019_Designing-Secure-Boot-Securely_NT-AS.pdf">2019</a>) and <strong>escalating privileges on Linux</strong> (<a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_FDTC_Escalating-Privileges-in-Linux-using-Fault-Injection_NT-CM.pdf">2017</a>, <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_BlueHat-v17_KERNELFAULT-R00ting-the-Unexploitable-using-Hardware-Fault-Injection_CM_NT.pdf">2017</a> and <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_Hardwear-io_Escalating-Privileges-in-Linux-using-Fault-Injection_NT-CM.pdf">2017</a>).</p>
<p>Like many of you, our curiosity is constantly sparked and therefore we cannot prevent ourselves from injecting glitches. This post will be your first peek into our new and exciting <strong>FI</strong> research.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_PoC_Using-Fault-Injection-to-Turn-Data-Transfers-into-Arbitrary-Execution_CM-NT.pdf">presentation</a> at <a href="http://www.powerofcommunity.net/2019.htm#" target="_blank">POC2019</a> <em>advances</em> and <em>generalizes</em> the <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2016/2016_FDTC_Controlling-PC-on-ARM-using-Fault-Injection_NT-AS-MW.pdf">research</a> we published in 2016 at <a href="https://fdtc.deib.polimi.it/FDTC16/" target="_blank">FDTC</a>, where we showed that <em>“data transfers”</em> can yield <em>“arbitrary code execution”</em> using <strong>FI</strong>. During our demonstration live on stage we injected <strong>voltage glitches</strong> into the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32/overview" target="_blank">Espressif ESP32</a> using the open source <a href="https://github.com/noopwafel/iceglitch" target="_blank">iceGLITCH</a>. More specifically, we showed how <strong>FI</strong> can be used to modify <strong>callx8 instructions</strong> in order to achieve <strong>arbitrary control</strong> of the <strong>program counter</strong> in situations where the attacker controls nothing more than just <strong>the data</strong> being transferred.</p>
<p>It's important to point out that our <strong>2016 research</strong> showed the program counter can be be controlled on processor architectures where it is directly addressable (e.g. ARMv7). Our <strong>2019 research</strong> showed that the program counter can be controlled even if the it is not directly addressable (e.g. ARMv8). Moreover, maybe even more relevant, this is possible leveraging <strong>common software constructs</strong> such as the  <code>memcpy</code> function.</p>
<p>Let us be clear…</p>
<p>You can perform these type of attack when you <strong>only</strong> control <strong>the data</strong> being transferred. Neither the <strong>destination</strong> nor the <strong>source</strong> of the data transfer needs to be controlled, <strong>just the data</strong> itself. Moreover, you can leverage <strong>common software constructs</strong> executed by <strong>privileged code</strong> (e.g. Kernel) that copy data from an untrusted domain (e.g. an communication interface or external data source like flash), which are present on any device. Then, if the underlying <strong>hardware is vulnerable</strong> to <strong>FI</strong>, and many standard chips are, you can achieve <strong>full control</strong> of the program counter, <strong>regardless</strong> of the processor architecture.</p>
<p>We disclosed our research to <strong>Espressif</strong> before the presentation. It was received with interest and we discussed the potential risk for the <strong>ESP32</strong> chip. Nonetheless, as the results were achieved in a <strong>fully controlled environment</strong> targeting <strong>test code</strong>, we agreed that the impact was minimal at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward to early 2020 and we obtained new hardware <strong>FI</strong> tooling to support our research endeavors. We decided to test our new capabilities on a target already available to us and that we were familiar with. We decided to focus on injecting electromagnetic (EM) glitches. We will refer to this technique as <strong>EMFI</strong>.</p>
<p>We started with a typical approach where we target test code that is entirely under our control in order to determine the resilience of the <strong>ESP32</strong> towards <strong>EM glitches</strong>. Once we determined the <strong>ESP32</strong> is vulnerable, we set our final goal to put our <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_PoC_Using-Fault-Injection-to-Turn-Data-Transfers-into-Arbitrary-Execution_CM-NT.pdf">2019</a> research into practice.</p>
<p>We decided our first step towards to this goal was to bypass the <strong>Secure Boot</strong> implementation of the <strong>ESP32</strong>. It's important to point out that when we started our research, several researchers already published <strong>FI</strong> attacks on this implementation for which Espressif issued an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Fault_Injection_and_Secure_Boot" target="_blank">advisory</a>. Differently from the attacks already published, we used <strong>EM glitches</strong> instead of <strong>voltage glitches</strong> to <strong>trigger</strong> a similar hardware vulnerability. Our approach has several advantages, as <strong>EMFI</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>typically requires no <strong>invasive modifications</strong> to the target</li>
<li>is somewhat <strong>localized</strong>,  as the EM field has a definite spatial distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, besides reproducing the already published attack, we identified several new approaches for exploiting the faults we introduce, which allow us to bypass both <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong>. By doing so, we also identified several <strong>new vulnerabilities</strong> for which <strong>Espressif</strong> issued an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/Security%20Advisory%20CVE-2020-15048%2C%2013629%20EN%26CN.pdf" target="_blank">advisory</a>. <strong>Espressif</strong> indicated that these attacks do not apply to the the updated <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/ESP32_ECO_V3_User_Guide__EN.pdfe" target="_blank">ESP32 V3</a> and <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2" target="_blank">ESP32-S2</a> chips.</p>
<p>In this post we describe our approach for bypassing <strong>Secure Boot</strong> without <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> enabled (i.e. reproducing <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Fault_Injection_and_Secure_Boot" target="_blank">CVE-2019-15894</a>) using <strong>EMFI</strong>. In several upcoming posts, which will be posted in the upcoming weeks, we will describe our other attacks, including the new vulnerabilities we identified (i.e. <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15048" target="_blank">CVE-2020-15048</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13629" target="_blank">CVE-2020-13629</a>).</p>

<p>After over a decade of conducting <strong>FI</strong> testing and research, we know out of firsthand experience that the <strong>identification</strong> and <strong>exploitation</strong> of <strong>FI</strong> vulnerabilities may require a long breath. It's not always so trivial as some may make you believe. <strong>Expert tooling</strong> in the hands of <em>advanced users</em>, can make a dramatic difference in the <strong>identification</strong> phase, let alone during the <strong>exploitation</strong> of the identified vulnerabilities. Therefore, we like to use <a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-fi/" target="_blank">commercially available</a> tooling during our <strong>FI</strong> research.</p>
<p>We believe that our results may be achieved using low cost (e.g. <a href="http://store.newae.com/chipshouter-kit/" target="_blank">ChipShouter</a>) or Do-It-Yourself (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/BADFET" target="_blank">BADFET</a>) tooling as well. However, this type of tooling may be limiting and is often not able to sufficiently sweep the <strong>glitch parameter</strong> search space. Nonetheless, we believe that once a <strong>FI</strong> vulnerability is identified and exploited, and therefore the required <strong>glitch parameters</strong> are known, <strong>low cost tooling</strong> may be tuned or built to inject a successful glitch.</p>
<p>To set ourselves up for success, being able to sweep the glitch parameter search space efficiently, we use the following components to conduct our <strong>FI</strong> research:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.riscure.com/product/spider/" target="_blank">Riscure Spider</a></li>
<li><a href="https://getquote.riscure.com/en/quote/2101124/xyz-stage-for-em-probe-em-fi-or-compact-laser.htm" target="_blank">Riscure XYZ stage</a></li>
<li><a href="https://getquote.riscure.com/en/quote/2101068/em-fi-transient-probe.htm" target="_blank">Riscure EM-FI Transient Probe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-fi/" target="_blank">Riscure Inspector FI Python</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We execute the <a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-fi/" target="_blank">Inspector FI Python</a> framework on an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html" target="_blank">Intel NUC</a> in order to communicate with the above components. A logical representation of the setup is shown below.</p>

</p>
<p>The picture below shows the setup in action, while we inject <strong>EM</strong> glitches into the <strong>ESP32</strong>.</p>

</p>

<p>We used the <a href="https://www.az-delivery.de/en/products/esp32-developmentboard" target="_blank">ESP32 NodeMCU</a> modules available from <a href="https://www.az-delivery.de/en" target="_blank">AZ Delivery</a> which is shown in the picture below. These modules are designed around a <strong>ESP32-WROOM-32</strong> package.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://raelize.com/posts/img/esp32/nodemcu.png">
		<img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/nodemcu.png" width="300px">
	</a>
</p>
<p>We removed the metal casing of the <strong>ESP32-WROOM-32</strong> package in order to place the tip of the <strong>EM-FI Probe</strong> on the chip's surface. This is the only modification we made to the target in order to inject <strong>EM</strong> glitches.</p>

<p>The most important <strong>glitch parameters</strong> when performing <strong>EMFI</strong>, are <strong>position</strong>, <strong>power</strong> and <strong>timing</strong>. Tuning these parameters is not always trivial, especially when targeting something specific like <strong>Secure Boot</strong>. The combined parameter search space can be huge, especially if a fine grid is used for spatial positioning. Therefore, we typically start with an intermediate step that allows us to determine efficiently where exactly a chip is sensitive to <strong>EM</strong> glitches.</p>
<p>It's relevant to point out, that the first step for <strong>FI</strong>, after building the setup, is to determine if the target is <strong>vulnerable</strong>. As such vulnerability is at the <strong>chip level</strong> (i.e. hardware), it does not matter if it is identified on a <strong>development board</strong> or an <strong>finalized device</strong> (i.e. the vulnerability is the same). That's why, if possible, we typically prefer to perform the initial research using a development board that's designed around the same or similar chip. Then, porting the attack to a finalized device, especially when the software is the same as well (e.g. ROM code), is often trivial.</p>
<h2 id="test-code">Test code</h2>
<p>The test code we use during this intermediate step includes a command handler with at least one command, which does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>receive command byte</li>
<li>set trigger high</li>
<li>using assembly to initialize unused registers with known values</li>
<li>using assembly to increase a counter with add instructions (i.e add sled)</li>
<li>set trigger signal low</li>
<li>print the counter result</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the implementations used during our <strong>ESP32</strong> research is shown below. The test code allows us to identify a successful glitch by observing the counter printed on the <strong>serial interface</strong>. If the counter value is different than the expected value (i.e. 10,000), then the glitch we injected <strong>successfully</strong> affected the target's execution without preventing program continuation.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, NIST announced Round 3 of the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions">Post-Quantum Cryptography project</a> and published <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8309/final">their rationale</a> for selecting from the Round 2 candidates.</p>



<p>NIST did something clever this time, and Round 3 was separated into two groups: <strong>Finalists</strong> and <strong>Alternative Candidates</strong>.</p>



<p>Finalists are algorithms that NIST (and the majority of the cryptographers involved in NIST’s decisionmaking) believe are production-ready and worth standardizing immediately.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Alternative Candidates are algorithms that NIST believes need a few more years of cryptanalysis and research before feeling confident about, for one reason or another.</p>



<p>I’m sure everyone in cryptography has their own opinions about the Round 3 selection, but I’d like to analyze the Round 3 finalists from a very opinionated, real-world perspective.</p>



<p>I’ll look at the alternative candidates in a future post.</p>







<h2>Judgement Criteria</h2>



<p>I will be evaluating <strong>Key Encapsulation</strong> algorithms based on real world operational requirements–rather than theoretical notions of security–for public key encryption and key encapsulation, namely:</p>



<ol><li>Feasibility to integrate with existing transport-layer protocols (TLS, Noise, etc.)</li><li>Support for offline public-key encryption (a.k.a. “sealing”) APIs in application-layer cryptography.<p>This means you can encrypt with an online public key, but decryption requires a secret key that is kept offline and only accessed when needed.</p></li></ol>



<p>I will be evaluating <strong>Digital Signature</strong> algorithms based on the following criteria:</p>



<ol><li>Statelessness: Can the algorithm be safely used in a virtual machine that gets rolled back?</li><li>Bandwidth: Are signatures reasonably small?</li></ol>



<p>Some people might object to this criteria, but t<strong>his post is ultimately my opinion</strong>, and those are the criteria I care about the most.</p>



<h2>Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Round 3 Finalists</h2>



<h3>Classic McEliece</h3>



<p>Classic McEliece is based on error-correcting codes.</p>



<p>Classic McEliece has large public keys (ranging from 261120 bytes to 1357824 bytes in the Round 2 submission) but short ciphertexts (128 to 240 bytes). This makes it difficult to implement Classic McEliece in protocols like TLS (since it will require a minimum of 4 TCP packets just to transmit a public key).</p>



<p>Classic McEliece does not have decryption failures, making it suitable for offline public-key encryption. However, the enormous public key may hinder adoption here too.</p>



<h3>CRYSTALS-KYBER</h3>



<p>CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) encompasses two proposals: Kyber (key encapsulation) and Dilithium (signatures).</p>



<p>Kyber public keys range from 800 bytes (for Kyber-512) to 1568 bytes (for Kyber-1024) and ciphertexts range from 736 bytes to 1568 bytes, which means that Kyber can be easily used in protocols like TLS.</p>



<p>Kyber decryptions have a failure probability of about 1 in 2^160. While this probability is unlikely to ever occur in the real world, any nonzero failure probability baked into the algorithm does mean that encrypting a symmetric key with Kyber, strictly speaking, can prevent you from decrypting the symmetric key successfully. This makes it difficult to recommend Kyber in confidence for offline-decryption protocols, since there is no opportunity to recover from the (however improbable) error.</p>



<p>(This isn’t an argument that 2^-160 is too high. Any nonzero probability baked into any algorithm is still nonzero, and therefore irks me.)</p>



<h3 id="ntru">NTRU</h3>



<p>NTRU is another lattice-based scheme, and one of the oldest post-quantum lattice cryptosystems ever developed. (It’s so old that the patents have all expired.)</p>



<p>Like Kyber, NTRU offers small public keys (699 bytes for ntruhps2048509 on the low end, 1230 bytes for ntruhps4096821on the high end), making NTRU suitable for protocols like TLS that require small-ish public keys.</p>



<p>Like Kyber, NTRU boasts a decryption failure rate less often than 1 in 2^100 for all parameter sets. (The precise failure rates are not given in the NTRU specification document.) Strictly speaking, this might never be a practical concern, but it is still technically possible to encrypt something with NTRU that cannot be decrypted. This makes it difficult to recommend NTRU for this use case.</p>



<h3 id="saber">SABER</h3>



<p>SABER is another lattice-based key encapsulation algorithm. SABER’s security is based on a different problem than Kyber and NTRU. However, SABER gets bonus points for calling its lightweight mode LightSABER and <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/pqcrypto/saber/">using a lightsaber in their website’s design</a>.</p>



<p>SABER offers small public keys (672 to 1312 bytes) and ciphertexts (736 to 1472 bytes). TLS should have no problem with SABER.</p>



<p>As with the other lattice-based proposals, the decryption failure probability is nonzero (2^-120 to 2^-165 for the SABER variants).</p>



<h3>Round 3 Key Encapsulation Finalist Summary</h3>



<p>If your only goal for post-quantum cryptography was to design primitives that can be used in online modes like TLS, then any of the lattice based proposals (Kyber, NTRU, SABER) are great.</p>



<p>For offline public-key encryption, all three of those proposals carry a nonzero risk of decryption failure, which can only really be mitigated by encrypting the same session key multiple times and storing multiple ciphertexts. This failure risk is already negligible (cosmic rays are more likely), but offline protocols have no recovery mechanism (whereas online protocols can just re-initiate a key exchange and call it a day).</p>



<p>One might argue that the probability is negligible (in fact, most cryptographers agree that a failure probability below 1 in 2^120 isn’t worth thinking about, since it will never happen in the real world), but I contend that a nonzero risk means they cannot be used in sealing APIs for general purpose cryptography libraries, since the developers of that library cannot be responsible for the decryption failure risk calculus for all of its users. </p>



<p>That is to say: In my humble opinion, in order to safely implement offline decryption, the algorithmic failure probability <strong>must be zero</strong>. Any nonzero algorithmic failure rate makes me grumpy (even if there’s no real-world, practical risk).</p>



<p>You might be tempted to just use Classic McEliece for sealing APIs, but since the public keys are enormous, I don’t see this being an option for constrained environments (i.e. embedded devices).</p>



<p>In short, I think the NIST PQC Round 3 finalists completely missed a use case that’s important to me, but apparently not important to NIST. (Offline decryption with a long-lived keypair.) Here’s hoping one or more of the non-lattice key encapsulation algorithms reaches maturity so we’re not caught in a catch-22.</p>



<h2>Post-Quantum Digital Signature Round 3 Finalists</h2>



<h3>CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM</h3>







<p>Dilithium is the signature counterpart to Kyber.</p>



<p>Dilithium is stateless. Public keys range between 1184 and 1760 bytes. Signatures range between  2044 bytes and 3366 bytes.</p>



<p>Nothing to complain about here.</p>



<h3>FALCON</h3>



<p>FALCON is difficult to implement, but it offers great performance and compact public keys (897 to 1793 bytes) and small signatures (~657 to ~1273 bytes). According to the Falcon website, Falcon-512 is about five times as fast as 2048-bit RSA.</p>



<p>Did I mention it’s stateless?</p>



<h3>Rainbow</h3>

Probably. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyVi__">LindseyVi</a>)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Rainbow is not a lattice-based scheme, in case you were sick of those. Instead it’s multivariate cryptography.</p>



<p>Rainbow public keys are somewhat large (149 KB to 1705.5 KB, although you can get 58.1 KB to 491.9 KB if you use compressed public keys). However, it boasts short signatures (64 bytes to 204 bytes).</p>



<p>Unlike the other schemes, the specification for Rainbow doesn’t spend a lot of time on introducing it in words. Instead, the paper just dives into the algorithm details without explaining “why?”.</p>



<h3>Round 3 Digital Signature Finalist Summary</h3>



<p>If you’re going to implement Kyber, it makes sense to also use Dilithium for signatures. Otherwise, FALCON’s performance is hard to beat.</p>



<p>Rainbow is interesting but requires large public keys and needs better documentation.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>The Round 3 key encapsulation finalists are great for online encryption, but I don’t feel all warm and fuzzy about algorithms that possess an inherent decryption failure probability.</p>



<p>The Round 3 digital signature finalists are solid. I have a slight preference for FALCON but Dilithium looks great. I don’t know enough about Rainbow to evaluate it.</p>



<p>If I had to make any prediction about the PQC selection, it would be (in order of most-to-least likely to be selected, assuming anyone at NIST shares my priorities):</p>



<ul><li>Key encapsulation<ol><li>CRYSTALS-KYBER</li><li>SABER</li><li>Classical McEliece</li><li>NTRU</li></ol></li><li>Digital signatures<ol><li>CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM</li><li>FALCON</li><li>Rainbow</li></ol></li></ul>



<p>(Excluding the alternative candidates, which merit a deeper analysis.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>As humans, we experience all kinds of emotions, but we rarely wonder how these thoughts and feelings come about. The modern scientific view says that mind and consciousness originate within the brain.</p> <p>But the question is that how something finite can give rise to something infinite, how a group of cells within the brain create a conscious experience.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>This mechanism is easy to understand from a scientific perspective, but what it falls short of is – explaining the cause that creates the very phenomenon, i.e., the conscious experience itself.</p><p>Therefore, science alone cannot explain the cause, and this has been famously or infamously known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hard Problem of Consciousness</a><em>,&nbsp;</em>which still confuses many scientists.</p><p>However, a spiritual inquiry into the nature of consciousness reveals something very different. What it essentially says is that we are neither our body nor our mind. We’re the ones who witness the body and the mind.</p><p>Whatever we experience through our senses is interpreted by our mind, and the mind further generates corresponding thoughts and emotions—feeling confused? Let’s try to simplify this discussion and understand it through examples and analogies.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>We all are aware of our emotions, and every emotion has an origin in the form of a thought. And where do these thoughts originate? The answer is – our mind.</p><p>The only way you have known your mind is through thoughts – there is no other way you can acknowledge its existence. But here’s the thing.&nbsp;<em>You are not your mind</em>. It is just a tool that you have to use to your advantage.</p><p><em>So the next question that naturally arises is how this information helps me in practical life?</em></p><p>If you’re can sustain your attention until the end of this article, you will know how useful this information can be for you.</p><p>The idea that ‘you are not your mind’ is not just some abstract theory. It can help you deal with some serious mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, worry, and even depression.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Understand the Nature of Your Mind</h2><p>Your mind tricks you into believing that you are it. That is the way it manipulates and controls you.</p><p>When you give in to your thoughts, you lose yourself – jumping from one afflicting thought to another, without realizing that it’s just your monkey mind playing with you.</p><p>An area of the brain known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Default Mode Network or DMN</a>&nbsp;gets activated when our mind starts wandering, thinking about others, remembering the past, or planning the future.</p><p>These thoughts repeatedly play within your mind forming a pattern. These patterns are nothing but unconscious acts that train the neurons in your brain to form groups that simultaneously fire electrical impulses.</p><p>Hence the famous phrase, “neurons that fire together wire together”.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><p>It is not something you acquired by birth. It is a learned behavior that becomes ingrained within our subconscious through repeated action, i.e., a repeated thought with an accompanying emotion.</p><p>And now you complain that your thoughts torment you. And that your mind keeps working overtime.</p><p>The first lesson that we learned is that we are not the mind. But then, who are we? Well,&nbsp;<strong>we are the one that observes the mind</strong>. This knowledge gives us the missing confidence and indicates that we are the master, and the mind is the servant and not the other way around.</p><p>However, in modern-day living, we have become so compulsive in our behaviors. Every day we expose ourselves to many mind-numbing stimulations. All in the name of consumerism.</p><p>When we become compulsive consumers, mental health problems come as a natural consequence. They appear as symptoms within our physical body, and that’s a warning from nature that the commander (us) has lost control of the ship (the mind).</p><p>A big mistake that many people commit is that they try to control their thoughts forcefully. That is a futile exercise. The mind is too powerful, and any attempt to control it will result in the mind rebelling.&nbsp;</p><p>And there’s no chance you can hold up against the mind’s strength unless you have sufficiently practiced&nbsp;<em>the art of being present in the moment</em>.</p><p>If you want to tame your mind, you have to learn to&nbsp;<strong>let go of the control</strong>. You have to trick the mind. For example, there are days when I don’t feel like doing a workout. Even getting out of bed becomes a challenge for me.</p><p>So what do I do? Simple, I lie to my mind. Yes, you heard me correct.</p><p>I tell my mind that I’m going to work out only for five minutes and then go back to sleep in those soft cushy blankets.</p><p>But what ends up happening most of the time – I get started, do the warm-up, and a couple of minutes later, I’m really into it. I start enjoying it. One hour later – mission accomplished.&nbsp;<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>Had I given into that false feeling of laziness that was projected and amplified by my mind, I wouldn’t have been able to get out of those cushy blankets.</p><p>If I had forced my mind to work out for an hour, it would have rebelled, and I won’t have gotten started in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that you may be successful every time you try to trick your mind, but that’s okay. You’ll get better with practice.</p><p>The same tactic I use for my writing. Whenever I start writing something new, I tell myself that I am just writing 500 words. As I get into the flow, I end up writing much more than that.</p><p>Whatever task you have at hand, break it down into smaller chunks and give your mind the impression that you have to work on a small piece instead of the whole task.&nbsp;<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>This simple technique breaks down the initial resistance (which I know is a problem for many people) and makes going easy.</p><h2>Training Your Mind to Deal with Stress and Anxiety</h2><p>Now that you understand that you’re not your mind, we will look at a powerful self-observation technique that can help you deal with mental health issues like stress, worry, and anxiety.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, every emotion has its roots in the thought that generates it. It’s important to observe the thoughts we are creating, which can be very effectively done through self-observation.</p><p>This process is not easy, and it requires some effort on your part. But once you grasp this concept dealing with every challenge will become easy.</p><p>So when the thought originates within your mind, just observe its nature. A common pattern I see amongst people is that they lose themselves in their thoughts.</p><p>Sometimes the flow of thoughts is so strong that it’s difficult to stand your ground, and it’s tempting to give in to the flow. And over time, this becomes our default behavior – the result of unconscious programming.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-narrow-sky-2"></span></p><p>Let’s understand this with the help of an example. Suppose somebody in your office comes up to you and tells you that the company is planning to lay off some staff to cut costs.</p><p>Now, this is very likely to create anxiety. And it’s okay to be a little bit anxious in this situation.</p><p>But understand that this particular thought and the possible scenarios (sub-thoughts) arising out of it are only playing out in your mind. The layoff has not happened as of now.</p><p>To better understand, imagine yourself standing near the riverbank where the water is at the level of your hips.</p><p>You can feel a medium level of water current down in your feet, but it’s not that strong as yet. You are Anxious, but you’re still holding your ground.</p><p>This thought about the layoff keeps lingering within your mind for the rest of the day, and very soon, another thought appears where you imagine yourself without a job, or filing for bankruptcy.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-2"></span></p><p>A couple of minutes later, you imagine yourself homeless with your family out on the streets.</p><p>These thoughts keep getting worse one after the other, forming a chain, and they generate different emotions within you, especially the anxiety.</p><p>As these thoughts crop up in your mind, the water current in the river starts getting strong.</p><p>Eventually, it reaches a point where you have completely swept away, i.e., you have entirely disconnected your awareness from the present moment and have lost yourself in the river of thoughts.</p><p>Whenever our mind is anxious, we generate a chain of thoughts and start visualizing worst-case scenarios that are never likely to happen.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-4"></span></p><p>As our anxiety becomes intense, we start feeling the physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, sweating, and much more.</p><p>So what do we do to stop forming this chain?</p><h2>Recognize the Gap</h2><p>If you notice carefully, there is a small window of opportunity between the thought and the resulting emotion you invoke.</p><p>Through mindful practice, one can be aware of that small timeframe where you get to choose your response.</p><p>When you miss that opportunity (mostly the case), it’s easy to get lost in the barrage of the afflicting thoughts. And that further creates unpleasant sensations.</p><p>It will be hard initially because of the past conditioning of the mind, but when you learn to calm the mind, you also eliminate the previous conditioning.&nbsp;<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-3"></span></p><p>This new mind has a small window of awareness or pure wisdom, also known as the gap, where you can choose your response to a particular situation.</p><p>Let me explain this with a real-life example. You must have often come across a situation where you’re driving, and abruptly someone cuts ahead of you to take a turn, and you have to apply breaks suddenly.</p><p>If you are in your usual programmed mode, you are more likely to respond impulsively with either anger or rage. You might even roll down your window and hurl abuses at the person, escalating the situation further.</p><p>We often behave like this because our primal animal instincts are awakened under such circumstances where we are driven primarily by our ego.</p><p>However, if you are mindful, you will quickly identify the gap created (for a few milliseconds) between the moment that person cuts you, and the negative thought you create as a result.</p><p>If you have a high presence or awareness at that time, you will easily be able to recognize that gap and any unconscious impulsive reaction will be replaced with a conscious response.</p><p>In situations like these, the very first thing you observe is your physiology. The moment that person cut you and you applied the …</p></div></div>

I’ve laid out the index of topics covered in the post. </p><p>Depending on the stage of your journey, feel free to skip to the sections that are most relevant to you.<br></p><h3><strong>Topics covered in this post</strong></h3><ol role="list"><li>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</li><li>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</li><li>Standing out from competition</li><li>Shopify App Store optimisation basics</li><li>Find your #1 keyword</li><li>Getting customers to review your Shopify app (by delivering great customer support)</li><li>Getting the first customers for your Shopify app</li><li>Finding early users and beta testers for your Shopify app outside the App Store</li><li>Getting listed under the right categories &amp; collections, and getting featured on the Shopify App Store</li><li>The right pricing model for your Shopify app</li><li>Optimising for trials</li><li>Long term game plan in the Shopify App Store</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</strong></h2><p>Shopify isn’t the only choice when it comes to picking an apps marketplace. There’s </p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></li><li><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank">GSuite Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">Apple iOS App Store</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a></li></ul><p>All these marketplaces are valid options for you to start. I would lean on a marketplace where there’s a combination of 2 factors</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Familiarity with problems</strong> - You know what the core product is about, you understand or can empathise with its users maybe from using the tool at your previous workplace, you have an idea on the different kind of problems that exist in the ecosystem and don’t find it too boring to solve them</li><li><strong>Skillset to execute</strong> - If you don’t know how to build Android, iOS, or Mac apps, perhaps steer clear of it. Your goal is not to take on a hard challenge, it’s to take on a challenge where you have some advantage from skill and insight. The goal is to win.<br></li></ol><h3>Why you should pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Huge distribution:</strong> Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it. Shopify has 1mn+ merchants and tons of new signups every month who go to the app store browsing for solutions. <br>Shopify promotes apps within its product and has made it an integral part of its user journey. A new app is able to gain traction fairly easily in the app marketplace, which makes it friendly to newcomers. <br>Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it.</li><li><strong>Tons of app opportunities:</strong> E-commerce store owners have 101+ problems to be taken care of, and you can address any one and do a great job at it to build a sustainable business. It’s not hard (relative standards) to gain 200 paying customers paying you $10/mo to earn $2000/mo ($1600 after Shopify’s 20%)</li><li><strong>Ease of development:</strong> Shopify’s documentation and APIs are first-class, they get out of the way allowing you to build fast. Additionally, Shopify’s <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris UI framework</a> makes building app interfaces a piece of cake. It’s based on React and comes with a Sketch/Figma file to help you design and prototype solutions fast.</li><li><strong>Billing taken care of:</strong> Heads up, Shopify takes a 20% commission on all earnings. So if your app’s monthly subscription fees is $10, you get $8. In return, Shopify takes care of billing end to end.<br>You can charge monthly, annually, charge per activity, provide app credit, and issue refunds with very little effort. You don’t need to worry about failed payments, Shopify takes care of it. You don’t even need to generate an invoice, app bills are included in the merchant’s monthly Shopify invoice.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with ecommerce:</strong> If you’re someone who can jump into an industry and learn all about it, great. If not, you would want some familiarity with how an ecommerce store works, what are the typical problems faced by a merchant.<br>You can do this by creating a Shopify store and trying to sell your own products. Or you could have conversations with 10 different store owners and absorb from their experience. You could also find someone who works at an e-commerce agency for valuable insights. It’s not that hard.<br></li></ul><h3>Why you shouldn’t pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Copycat galore:</strong> You’re likely to copy an existing app and make a slight improvement in terms of product, pricing, or both. Guess what, the next smart person with the same idea can do the same to you. If you’re dependent on getting all or majority of your customers from the app store, be ready for stiff competition from copycats. <br>This doesn’t mean you cannot grow your app to $1k or $10k MRR. SaaS is not a winner take all market. It just means that it gets harder to grow as you grow. If this is something you are not mentally prepared for, steer clear. <br>There’s ways you can grow out of this by taking a long term strategy, either by taking a brand-centric approach (brand is not your name, but the experience that customers remember you by for which they’ll choose you over a copycat). <br>Or you can go upmarket and target large volume and Plus merchants, where ticket sizes are $200/mo or higher and switching does not happen often. </li><li><strong>Low-end, high-maintenance customers:</strong> Majority of Shopify merchants are people who don’t want to pay beyond $10-$15/mo and yet they expect world-class customer service. Some will ask for phone support or to jump on a video call. <br>You can tackle this by solving problems where the ticket sizes are higher, in the range of $50-$100/mo, but also expect it to be significantly harder to rank and fight existing competitors in such problem spaces. Example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=page+builder" target="_blank">page builders</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product+reviews" target="_blank">product review</a> apps. <br>You can mitigate this by going in with the mindset that you’ll be serving $15/mo customers, so your app better be self-serve ready, have a dead simple UX and sufficient documentation or walkthrough videos. You can also aim to be the cost-leader of a segment, example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme" target="_blank">Judge.me</a> </li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</strong></h2><p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">uncovering opportunities on Shopify</a> and I also shared all my research in my big <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hnpcl1VAlPC9MuFvvsl2UsU0yu1iM6aKR-iK30VtbwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shopify app ideas spreadsheet</a>. Let me reiterate on the advice shared there in a more structured manner that will hopefully better answer questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>“How do you find niches in the app store in the first place?”</li><li>“How to find a problem worth solving within shopify? (worth solving=stressful enough for merchants &amp; competition not too tough)”<br></li></ul><p>There have been people who have asked me what kind of problems to solve, or what are the underserved niches. The thing is - if there's an obviously underserved niche and people have taken the time to research about it, they are probably busy solving it. If it's being posted in any blog post, know that it's no longer an underserved or hidden niche, because clearly anyone could find it.</p><p>Ultimately, only you can find an idea that you find worthy enough to pursue, whose various pros and cons are justified in your mind. And therefore, I can only provide a directional framework towards evaluating ideas. I can't list out ideas.</p><p>The best use of a directional framework is to</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>First</strong> - cast a wide net, get to know what's out there</li><li><strong>Second</strong> - narrow down your search based on parameters you have decided</li></ol><p>This first section of the article will help you with casting a wide net. </p><p>As you go further along the article, I've shared ideas and techniques which you can use to narrow down your search.<br></p><h3>1- Browse the entire App Store</h3><p>I recommend this as the starting point for anyone new to the Shopify ecosystem. Start by browsing all the categories &amp; sub-categories of apps on the app store. You can do the same on <a href="https://sasi.unionworks.co.uk/categories" target="_blank">SASI</a>. </p><p>The purpose of browsing this way is to familiarise yourself with the different types of problems faced by merchants and being solved by apps. Ideally, you want to note down some interesting apps that you come across during your browsing adventure to investigate later on.</p><figure id="w-node-892fc283544a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f1c114edd643e073591f8cc_browse%20categories%20shopify%20app%20store.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2- Go through every letter in search autocomplete</h3><p>Okay, this is a step I took when&nbsp;I was browsing the app store. I would type in "aa", "ab", "ac"... ... ... "zz" on the search bar, note the autocomplete terms and check the results of ones I found to be interesting.</p><p>Turns out, Shopify has since updated their algorithm. Autocomplete suggestions only show up after you type 3 letters now. So you can't recreate what I did with autocomplete and go through every letter. It's not feasible anymore.</p><p>Not to worry, it's still useful.</p><h4>Plug in keywords of shortlisted apps into the search bar</h4><p>From step 1, all the apps (hopefully at least a dozen) that you shortlisted for being interesting, extract the keywords used in the app's title or description. </p><p>Now, enter …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>by Valentin, July 25 2020, in <a href="http://foobuzz.github.io/tag/random/">random</a></p><p>One of the most important realizations that I have had about mathematics is the fact that there is no global definition of what "infinity" is. You can't just drop the word "infinite" in any context, as if one day mathematicians had a meeting to decide the meaning of "infinity" and made it an element of reasoning you can use with any mathematical thing.</p><p>In set theory, a set is "infinite" if, for every natural number, the set has a subset whose cardinality is that of this natural number. In functional analysis, a function has a limit L as <em>x</em> approaches "infinity" if, for any tiny ɛ, there is a point after which the function won't ever be farther from L than the distance ɛ. The term of "infinity" obviously comes from an intuition about the philosophical notion of infinity, but it is then defined formally using very traditional and non-mystical notions and notations, and there isn't any global notion of "infinity". You can't take some random mathematical thing and ask "What happens when this goes to infinity?".</p><p>Now, when someone comes and says "hey, do you know that 0.999 with an infinite amount of 9s after the decimal point is equal to 1?", what most people do is that they try to picture the number 0.999 with an actual infinite number of nines after the decimal point and then they try to actually reason about this monstrosity. This is an interesting intellectual exercise, but when you're doing that, you're doing philosophy, not mathematics. If you want to do mathematics, what you should be asking back is "What is the definition of a number with a decimal repeating infinitely?"</p><p>There are multiple definitions for it, but the one that makes the most sense to me is an infinite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)#Convergent_series">series</a>. We can simply state that 0.999... can be written as 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + ... Formally, it would be written as follows:</p><p><img src="http://foobuzz.github.io/assets/articles/09-series.svg"></p><p>This form is very helpful, because the notion of infinite series is very well defined. It is simply the limit of the sequence of the partial sums. In other words, 0.999... is the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, etc. Let's call this sequence 0.(9)n for later reference. I like this definition because it reminds me of very important aspects of sequences and their limits that I learned when I was in school:</p><ol><li>There is no such thing as an "infinite term" of a sequence (and some teachers won't like it if you ever dare say something like that).</li><li>The limit of a sequence may very well be distinct than any of its terms.</li></ol><p>I think those two aspects are at the origin of the difficulty that there is to accept that 0.999... = 1. I think that the decimal representation with its "infinite digits" is misleading because it leads us to ponder the notion of an "infinite term" (of finite truncations) all while it is explicitly discouraged as soon as we actually consider the sequence of truncations itself. Then our minds are lost wandering in the vast pastures of infinity where it's hard to understand how a limit may not belong to the sequence itself. I think that what people really mean when they think that it's problematic that 0.999... = 1 is that the sequence of 0.(9)n <em>never</em> reaches 1 no matter how many time you look at the next term.</p><p>In other words, consider the set of all elements of the sequence: {0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, ...}. This set is obviously infinite, and 1, the limit of the sequence, does not belong to this set. When we ponder the notion of "infinity" in the context of 0.9..., what we might envision is the journey through this "infinite" set. With this in mind, it's hard to see how 1 can have anything to do with this, since it is outside the set.</p><p>But this begs the question: what is a "limit"? In layman terms, the limit of a sequence is a real number the sequence is ever getting closer to (without the requirement that it actually reaches it at any point). More formally, it means that for any tiny real number ɛ, there is a rank after which the sequence won't ever be farther from the limit than the distance ɛ. (This is the same definition than the one used in functional analysis I presented in the introduction.) Even without a formal proof, it seems pretty obvious than the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999,... has 1 for limit. And therefore, if you actually understand the proper meaning of the notation, that 0.999... = 1.</p><p>Now, since the limit of an increasing sequence also happens to be its supremum (least upper bound), this leads us to another definition, which is the one that is actually used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations.</p></blockquote><p>What this means is that if you take the sequence 0.(9)n, then the number that is written "0.999..." or said to have "an infinite amount of 9s after the decimal point" is the smallest number that is greater than all terms of the sequence. For example, 3 is greater than all the terms of the sequence, so that's a candidate. Is it the smallest such number? Well, certainly not. 2 is greater than all terms of the sequence and it is lesser than 3. Can we find smaller? Sure. 1 is greater than all terms of the sequence. Is there something even smaller? Hmm... doesn't seem so. I think 1 is the smallest. This, of course, is only intuition so far, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...#Formal_proof">the proof</a> is easy enough to follow.</p></article></div>]]>

July 25, 2020 | https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Around November of last year, I started a project to wrangle my digital life. Tired of haphazardly increasing my subjectivity by trusting "free" websites to provide various services, I wanted to wrest some control over my internet existence. I made a plan to self-host several "critical" services on my home network and maintain them personally. In short, I made a homelab.</p>
<p>To be frank, the professional websites that I was previously dependent upon are undoubtedly more reliable than my cobbled-together hobby project of a homelab. However, on general principle (and because it seemed like a fun way to learn some sysadmin / devops skills), I made this setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/homelab-network-diagram.svg" alt="Homelab Network Diagram"></p>
<p>As you can see, I have deployed a couple of general-purpose compute platforms: 4 ESXi hypervisors, and a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, there are several VM-based services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. For data storage and backup, I use a Synology NAS. Finally, a custom OpenBSD-based router provides internet connectivity to everything. In order to reduce operational overhead, I crafted <a href="https://github.com/0xC45/homelab-setup">a set of Ansible scripts</a> that deploy and configure all of these components.</p>
<p>Overall, making this setup has been quite a journey. In this blog post, I will describe my uses for each of these services, share my thoughts and experiences so far, and attempt to articulate my future improvement plans.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Of course, everything you see above already exists as a service on the internet. If my goal were solely the end feature set, it would have been much simpler to pay for each service. In most cases, there are even "free" versions available. For example, if I only cared about having access to a web-based git repository UI, I could have signed up for a Github or Gitlab account rather than bother setting up a Gitea VM on my home network.</p>
<p>However, like most of my hobby projects, this endeavor was more about the journey than the destination. By setting up these services on my home network, I learned a bunch of useful devops and sysadmin skills. Additionally, by running my own services, I have achieved the philosophical goal of reducing my reliance on 3rd party services. Now, if any of the services that I rely upon break, I am empowered to fix them. I am no longer dependent on the "opaque box" that is Google Drive, for example.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>So, without further ado, let's dive into each of the components that make up my homelab. For each component, I will describe the main utility it provides me, why I chose it, and any additional commentary that may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="router">Router</h3>
<p>The first component of my homelab is a custom OpenBSD-based router. It provides internet connectivity and DHCP to everything on my home network. Additionally, the device serves as a caching DNS server and firewall. I could write an entire blog post describing this router in excruciating detail. In fact, I <a href="https://0xc45.com/blog/openbsd-home-router/">already have</a>.</p>
<h3 id="esxi-hosts">ESXi Hosts</h3>
<p>In total, I maintain four physical <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a> hosts to form a platform for running virtual machines on my network.</p>
<p>Three of the ESXi hosts are Intel NUCs (System76 Meerkats). These smaller machines run the VMs that form my Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>The other ESXi host is a custom machine built from spare parts. It currently runs three VM-based HTTPS services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. Because it only runs three (relatively small) VMs, it has quite a bit of spare compute power leftover for future additions and/or temporary experiments.</p>
<p>I chose ESXi to run my virtual machines because it's enterprise quality and free. There are many hypervisors out there. For my current use case, ESXi is perfect. Also, in the future, I may consider expanding my use of VMware products by running vCenter to programmatically manage virtual machines, setting-up vSAN for shared storage, and potentially installing NSX if my networking requirements become more complicated. So, there is room to grow.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-cluster">Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
<p>In addition to the VM-based compute platform provided by ESXi, I run Kubernetes to provide a container-based compute platform. Though I do not currently use my Kubernetes cluster for anything, I have plans to setup <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo CI/CD</a>, experiment with <a href="https://knative.dev/">kNative</a>, develop some operators, and maybe run a <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/factorio">factorio game server</a>.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes cluster consists of 6 VMs running across 3 Intel NUCs. I chose to install Kubernetes on VMs with the ESXi hypervisor layer for ease of management. At some point, I'm sure to break things, want to reconfigure, etc. With the hypervisor, it's easier to perform these type of adjustments. Furthermore, at some point in the future, I may switch to <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid">TKG</a>, a vSphere-integrated distribution of Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="synology-nas">Synology NAS</h3>
<p>For backups and storing important data, I use a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218+">Synology NAS</a>. Though I didn't really shop around and compare NAS products / vendors, I am happy with the Synology so far. That being said, I would like to create my own NAS from scratch at some point in the future. However, the Synology product includes several features "out-of-the-box" that would be potentially difficult to replicate.</p>
<p>First, it has an easy-to-use application called <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/active_backup_business">"Active Backup for Business"</a> that can automatically take backups of ESXi virtual machines following configurable schedules and retention policies.</p>
<p>The VM backup application pairs nicely with the automatic cloud backup application, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/GlacierBackup">"Glacier Backup"</a>. Every night, after the VMs are backed-up to the NAS, I replicate the backups to Amazon S3 Glacier. Hopefully, this way I won't ever lose data.</p>
<p>Finally, the Synology has built-in UPS integration. If <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Power-Saving-Back-UPS-Pro-1500/P-BR1500G">my UPS</a> loses power for more than one minute, the NAS will cleanly shutdown, preventing any data corruption that could be caused by an unexpected power loss.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud-vm">Nextcloud VM</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> as my "personal cloud". I use it to store my important files and photos. The desktop / mobile application synchronizes the files across all of my devices, allowing me to edit and view my files from anywhere. </p>
<p>Nextcloud also has the capability to install "apps" that provide additional functionality. Currently, I have only installed one app, <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck">"Deck"</a>. Deck is a Kanban-style project management and organization tool. I use Deck to plan, organize, and record progress on my hobby projects.</p>
<p>Because it gives me the capability to install (and potentially create) apps, Nextcloud is an extensible platform. It's open source and under active development. Though the recent major version upgrade was a bit rocky (for me, at least), I'm happy with Nextcloud and plan to stick with it.</p>
<h3 id="gitea-vm">Gitea VM</h3>
<p>Of course, I need a place to store my code. For that purpose, I use <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>. I prefer Gitea to Gitlab because it's lighter-weight. Unlike Gitlab, there aren't a million additional features bundled-in that add bloat (in my opinion). Also, I slightly prefer the Gitea UI over the Gitlab UI.</p>
<p>There's really not much else to say about Gitea. It works great for my purposes. I push all of my code to the Gitea VM running on my home network. Whenever I want to "publish" a project or share it with the world, I push my code to a public Github repo.</p>
<h3 id="harbor-vm">Harbor VM</h3>
<p>To make container images available for running on my Kubernetes cluster, I need a container registry. For this purpose, I use <a href="https://goharbor.io/">Harbor</a>, an open source solution that seems to be the current most popular self-hosted container registry. In addition to providing a standard API for pushing/pulling container images, Harbor has the useful capability to scan container images for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Harbor has worked well for me so far, but I haven't really placed it under a serious workload. Soon, I will start using my Kubernetes cluster for various projects, which will require pushing / pulling images from Harbor on a regular basis. Perhaps, at some point in the future, I will have a more nuanced opinion of Harbor.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Though I am happy with the current setup, I continually find myself coming up with ideas for potential improvements and additions to the homelab. Here are a couple of the more well-defined ideas.</p>
<p>First, I want to install <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> on the Kubernetes cluster to run pipeline-based workflows. For example, it could be useful to automatically run tests for every commit that gets pushed to my repositories on Gitea. More generally, I could configure Argo to trigger a job for any arbitrary external event. It could be used to create a notification service. Or, it could be used to manage heavy workloads. There are endless potential uses for a pipeline-based workflow engine such as Argo.</p>
<p>Second, I want to create a dashboard that provides a graphical representation of the status of each of my homelab components using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. Using various open-source tools, I could collect metrics and aggregate them. Then, using Grafana, I could visualize the data. It would be useful to be able to quickly ascertain the state of my home network services in order to understand workloads, diagnose issues, etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the work spanning several months, creating my homelab has been quite a journey. Along the way, I started to grow weary, concerned that I had signed myself up for the all-consuming task of operating my homelab. With the overhead required to maintain all the various components, how could I ever have time for anything else? However, I'm happy to report that the Ansible script automation has proved worthwhile. Now, upgrades, configuration changes, and various "day 2" operations are quick and simple. At this point, I'm looking forward to shifting gears and working on something else for a while, using my homelab services as helpful tools along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop">Huawei Hacked My Laptop?</a></p><p><img alt="" src="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29436/20200725_180027.huawei-xhost.png?width=500&amp;height=444"></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows a script called "Huawei Autorun" which executes the command "xhost +" when you login. This command makes your Linux desktop remotely accessible to anyone on the network. The "Huawei Autorun" script appeared on my laptop after installing a Huawei E353 HSPA+ 3G USB stick (with serial number CE0682 on the back).</p>

<p>It seems like I dodged a bullet as I don't use the standard Linux GNOME desktop, so the script was not enabled, but the fact remains that Huawei installed malware on my Linux laptop. If they managed to get into my laptop, imagine what is happening inside your phone.</p>

<p>State-sponsored hacking is real.</p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE----</strong></p>

<p>For those people who requested more information. The OS is Debian 8.1 LTS. The script is basically a one-liner embedded in an autostart launcher (see below). It was installed as root, so I must have screwed up big time there. Obviously, I'll&nbsp;have to reinstall my OS.&nbsp;Debian 8 is at end of life&nbsp;now anyway.</p>

<pre>$ cat /etc/xdg/autostart/HuaweiAutoStart.desktop 
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Huawei  AutoRun
Name[en_US]=Huawei AutoRun
<strong>Exec=xhost +</strong>
SwallowExec=
SwallowTitle=
Terminal=false
TerminalOptions=
Type=Application
URL=
X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
GenericName[en_US]=</pre>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 2----</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I decided to check out this modem. It does include Linux drivers which require root for installation. I reran the installation script as root and sure enough the same autostart script was reinstalled.</p>

<pre>$ ls /etc/xdg/autostart/ -l
total 116
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  305 Oct 10  2014 at-spi-dbus-bus.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6351 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7777 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7339 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-secrets.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5996 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7741 Aug 27  2014 gsettings-data-convert.desktop
<strong>-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  262 Jul 25 23:59 HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</strong>
<span>....</span>
</pre>

<p>This script is also installed to <span>$HOME/.config/autostart/</span><span>HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</span>. Another script called <span>ReadDisplay</span> is&nbsp;installed in <span>/usr/local/modem</span> which&nbsp;passes the&nbsp;<span>$DISPLAY</span>&nbsp;environment variable to a binary&nbsp;called <span>MobilePartner</span>. The drivers do include a GUI, but if the sole purpose of all this is to fire up a GUI then it is not only exceptionally sloppy code, but also a&nbsp;security risk that needs explaining.</p>

<p>Below is a tarball image of the huawei e353 drivers so you can audit them for yourself. I've included the Windows drivers so you get an image of the disk just as I have it. Heck you could even try it for yourself. The drivers didn't compile the second time I did this, but the autostart script was still installed.</p>

<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29437/huawei-e353-malware.tar.gz">Download huawei e353 drivers (warning, possible malware!)</a></p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 3----</strong></p>

<p>I'm giving Huawei the benefit of doubt on this one. As a commenter suggested, it is probably a hack to run the GUI as root. Either way, it is still a nasty vulnerability, even if your X server is configured to use local sockets by default. I guess this&nbsp;shows the folly of blindly trusting hardware manufactures. I'll be sticking to open source code from official repositories in the future.</p>

<p>Live and learn, I suppose.</p>

      <p>Based on the article, I would think it is just a sloppy and lazy implementation, but the title does served as a bait clicker. The comment where avoiding pure chinese company or there is at least American company involved will be pure ignorance&nbsp;or turning a blind eye on what is happening around the world and purely cynical. Every country spying on people when they have the means and ways. So don't even think for a second that&nbsp;&nbsp;an American company involvement will make it any better. That will be pure ignorant.<br>
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html</a></p>

    
  <p>It's more likely the package installed some graphical configuration tool that needs to run as root. Running "xhost +" is a lazy way to enable programs running as root to connect to your non-root user's X11 session.</p>

<p>I don't know what debian's default settings are regarding Xorg and networking, but on my laptop Xorg appears to only be listening on unix sockets, which are obviously not accessible from the whole network.</p>

    
  <blockquote>
<p><span>State-sponsored hacking is real.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Yes. It's happening. 14 eyes (US+others) are also doing it. So I don't trust US services and devices either.</span></p>

<p><span>While they're banning each other of different things, open hardware is rising up and welcoming everyone (for example RISC V). We need things like this in this world to bring in peace so that they don't fight over silli things.</span></p>

    
  <p>Clean the system, you most likely found one piece of the drop. Replace the drive, looks to be a long weekend</p>

    
  <p>I avoid any pure Chinese tech, where possible. By law in China, all companies must work with the CCP (which means the military). Obviously, iPhones and such are made in China, although production is starting to move to other countries under Trump's trade policies, but at least there is an American company involved on the HW and SW sides.</p>

    
  <p>Did inserting the Huawei E353 dongle attach a virtual CD-ROM drive that you manually installed drivers from? I know for a fact similar devices (eg, ZTE MF910) offer drivers this way. The generic Linux USB ethernet driver worked fine, so there's no need to install Huawei or ZTE's driver.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning USB On-The-Go devices (including Android phones and 4G modems) have relatively powerful processors running a wide variety of network services, including an insecure web server (for the end-user web configuration interface), high-precision location, a high bandwidth internet side-channel (the 4G connection itself) while also having the ability to act as any USB client device (including keyboards to send keystrokes). They are an incredibly powerful platform for targeted cyberattacks and I imagine state actors are using them very often.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt3/">previous post</a> we have written code to change the amplitude of wave files.</p>
<p>Now we’ll take a look at how we can turn a mono wave file into a stereo wave file with optional
panning, and explore how this is represented internally by the WAVE file format.</p>

<p>The raw audio data inside a WAVE file consists of multiple frames. For now, we have called them
‘samples’ although that is strictly speaking not entirely correct. In fact, single float in the raw
audio data only corresponds to a single sample when we assume a mono audio file.</p>
<p>When you have multiple channels, a single ‘sample’ can consist of multiple frames. As each channel
needs to play a certain ‘frame’ at any given point in time.</p>
<p>In the WAVE file format, the channels are interleaved. For example, a stereo file would be
laid out like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/interleaving.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, each sample consists of two frames. Such that frame 1 and 2 make up sample 1, frame 3 and 4
make up sample 2, and so on..</p>
<p>Programs know how to interpret the raw audio data because of the <code>fmt</code> chunk inside the audio file,
which specifies the number of channels that are present in the raw audio data. The maximum number of
channels in a wave file is actually as high as 65,536, which does not actually make sense for audio
data.</p>
<p>Some common ones would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-channel: mono</li>
<li>2-channel: stereo</li>
<li>3-channel: stereo + center channel</li>
<li>4-channel: Quadrophonic</li>
<li>5-channel: “Surround sound”</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience though, we’ll mostly work on mono and stereo files. Not only are they the most
commonly used, this also allows us to test our code without needing a more expensive setup.</p>

<p>So what is a pan? When you pan an audio signal, you essentially make an audio signal ‘louder’ on
either the left or the right side. Typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a> this would be represented by an ‘automation
track’ between the value of -1 to 1.</p>
<p>The program to apply a pan will take three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>input file</li>
<li>output file</li>
<li>pan (-1 to 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the input file we will restrict this to mono files, and for the output files we will always
generate a stereo file. The pan variable should be between -1 (left) and 1 (right). Before we can
start applying our pan, we need to read the raw audio data from an input wave file. Remember that to
read the wave file we will use the <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> library we made
earlier:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>import</span> (
        <span>wav</span> <span>"github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/wave"</span>
)
</code></pre></div><p>The set up for this program is rather simple, we will use the build-in <code>flags</code> package to parse the
input from the CLI.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>var</span> (
	<span>input</span>  = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"i"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"input file"</span>)
	<span>output</span> = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"o"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"output file"</span>)
	<span>pan</span>    = <span>flag</span>.<span>Float64</span>(<span>"p"</span>, <span>0.0</span>, <span>"pan in range of -1 (left) to 1 (right)"</span>)
)
</code></pre></div><p>Once we have our flags set up, we can parse them and read the input file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>flag</span>.<span>Parse</span>()
	<span>infile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span>
	<span>outfile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>output</span>
	<span>panfac</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>pan</span>
	<span>wave</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>ReadWaveFile</span>(<span>infile</span>)
	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>"Could not parse wave file"</span>)
	}
        <span>...</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>So far so good. We have parsed the input so we know which value to use for our pan, and we have read
the raw audio data as well. But how do we go from a value in the range of (-1) to (1) to an actual
change in loudness on the left or right-side? We can imagine that a simple function would look like
this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>panposition</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>left</span>, <span>right</span> <span>float64</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>position</span> <span>float64</span>) <span>panposition</span> {
	<span>position</span> <span>*=</span> <span>0.5</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>panposition</span>{
		<span>left</span>:  <span>position</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span>,
		<span>right</span>: <span>position</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span>,
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using a struct that can represent the amplitude on a scale of 0 to 1 for both the left
and right channel. Such that we observe the following values:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>position</th>
<th>left-channel</th>
<th>right-channel</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In other words, if the position is zero the sound is perfectly balanced between the left and
right-side of your headphones. And in the extreme values, the sound is either only left-sided or
right-sided.</p>
<p>Just like in the previous post, we actually need to alter the frames based on the position data we
found in the <code>calculatePosition</code> function. We can create a function that modifies the frames based
on the <code>panposition</code> returned in the previous function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>applyPan</span>(<span>frames</span> []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>, <span>p</span> <span>panposition</span>) []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span> {
	<span>out</span> <span>:=</span> []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>{}
	<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>s</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>frames</span> {
		<span>out</span> = append(<span>out</span>, <span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>(float64(<span>s</span>)<span>*</span><span>p</span>.<span>left</span>))
		<span>out</span> = append(<span>out</span>, <span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>(float64(<span>s</span>)<span>*</span><span>p</span>.<span>right</span>))
	}
	<span>return</span> <span>out</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how for each <code>frame</code> we actually append two <code>frames</code> to the resulting slice! That is how we
are interleaving the left and right audio channel.</p>
<p>Now we can finish up the main method:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">        <span>...</span>
	<span>pos</span> <span>:=</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>panfac</span>)
	<span>scaledFrames</span> <span>:=</span> <span>applyPan</span>(<span>wave</span>.<span>Frames</span>, <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>panfac</span>))
	<span>wave</span>.<span>NumChannels</span> = <span>2</span> <span>// samples are now stereo, so we need dual channels
</span><span></span>	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>WriteFrames</span>(<span>scaledFrames</span>, <span>wave</span>.<span>WaveFmt</span>, <span>outfile</span>); <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>err</span>)
	}
</code></pre></div><p>A crucial step here is that before writing the samples we have set ran <code>wave.NumChannels=2</code>. Without
this, the wave file would be interpreted as a mono sound file and our panning effect would have been
lost.</p>

<p>To test this, I find it easy to use an input file without a lot of things going on. I’m mainly using
this simple <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/mono.wav">mono file</a>.</p>
<p>If we run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o left-side.wav -p -1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/left-side.wav">left-side.wav</a></p>
<p>And when we  run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o right-side.wav -p 1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/right-side.wav">right-side.wav</a></p>

<p>There is actually a flaw with this panning function that we are using. However it is not apparent to
us yet because we can only set a pan for an entire audio source. To see why this panning function is
not perfect we need to first introduce breakpoints as a way to create automation tracks, so the focus for our next few posts will be
breakpoints. :-)</p>

<em>(If you plan to develop a white-label mobile app, JUST DON'T!!!</em> 😅 <em>But this is a story for another post.)</em>
I implemented a <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> that was very tightly coupled with back-end implementation.</p><p>The PRs were created, reviewed, and approved by front-end and back-end teams.
Everything was tested, some small bugs were found, I fixed them and was ready for merging to <code>master</code> branch.
But some severe bugs and priority features had to be done,
so the back-end developer had to switch working on them and the back-end implementation was not shipped in production.</p><p>I didn't want to merge my commits in <code>master</code> branch,
as the implementation in back-end may be changed after addition of other requirements
and decided to wait until the back-end developer will be free and ready to merge his implementations.</p><p>I thought that the feature will be shipped the week after.</p><p>Meanwhile, I started working on the next feature that was based on the <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong>.
When I finished I didn't create a new PR in <code>master</code> branch as the <code>feature2</code> branch included changes from <code>feature10</code>.
After a week I asked the back-end developer about the status with <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> shipment to production,
but he was busy with other tasks and as the app was in active development I continued developing on top of <strong><code>big-feature</code></strong> branch.</p><p>I was working alone in that repo and the front-end devs were helping me only with pair programming or opinions on feature implementations.
No one needed my changes and I took the easy path of just working on features/bugs and creating builds directly for testers and onboarding clients.</p><p>Time has passed, the back-end developer forgot about the <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong>.
I was working on features and bug fixes.
<code>feature5</code>, <code>feature10</code>, <code>feature13</code>, <code>bugfix12</code>, <code>refactor2</code> branches were all created on top of <strong><code>big-feature</code></strong> branch.</p><p>One day I understood that the PR in <code>master</code> branch will be an <strong>ENORMOUS</strong> lesson for me and the team.
Another developer joined the project so I created a new <code>dev</code> branch from <code>feature16</code> and for the last 2 weeks, we created and reviewed PRs in <code>dev</code> branch.</p><p>Finally after <strong>140 days</strong> from the beginning of <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> the back-end implementation was merged and shipped to prod.</p><p>And I was ready for <strong>my biggest Pull Request</strong> <em>(so far)</em>.</p><h2>The Pull Request</h2><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You got a new dog, he’s very smart. So you decided to call him Brain. You love Brain, he’s your best friend now, and you always do things together. Everything would be perfect if Brain didn’t have this little problem; He gets distracted very easily, and when you go out for a walk, he pulls you around. No matter how tight you hold the leash, he always wins. It doesn’t stop there, and most often you find yourself following Brain rather than the other way around.</p><p>You are so frustrated, you can’t get anything done. Brain always wants to eat, play, or go outside to chase squirrels. You had enough, it’s time to train Brain, take control, and show him who is in charge!<br></p><p>The first step to changing Brain’s behavior is understanding why the behavior is happening.</p><h2>How Dogs Learn</h2><p>Training dogs is all about teaching them that you are the Alpha, and then using psychological techniques to reinforce their learning around key behaviors. The three different types of learning I’ll address here are called <strong>classical conditioning</strong>, <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, and <strong>social learning</strong>.</p><h3>Conditioned Behavior</h3><p>Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, through experiments with dogs and published in 1897. In one of his most famous experiments, Pavlov offered food to dogs and rang a bell at the same time. Over time, the dogs began to salivate (an unconscious response to food) not only when food was offered, but also when the bell was rung.</p><figure id="w-node-7408c90152ab-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f1b2f8837dee2e4604d0561_Group.png" alt="Pavlov’s experiment with dogs"></p></figure><p>In this way, a dog can be taught to associate a certain event (positive or negative) with another stimulus. This model explains why some dogs can recognize the word “walk” and will grab their leash or get excited if someone says the word.</p><h3>Operant Conditioning</h3><p>Operant conditioning is based more on voluntary behavior. And It’s done by <strong>reinforcement</strong> or <strong>punishment</strong>. This theory was first elaborated by B.F. Skinner, who conducted experiments using rats and pigeons to assess learning based on stimuli. In this model, punishment doesn’t mean abuse or even physical force; it could simply be the removal of something positive, such as attention if a dog engages in bad behavior. Operant conditioning has four quadrants and they are:<br></p><p>1. Positive-reinforcement: This is when you reward your dog for performing a behavior that you would like your dog to repeat.<br></p><p>2. Negative-reinforcement: This is when pressure is applied, and it is only turned off when your dog complies.<br></p><p>3. Positive-punishment: This is when you use a physical correction (such as popping on the leash) to reduce the occurrence of a behavior.<br></p><p>4. Negative-punishment: This is when you withhold a reward from your dog. For example, your dog wants a treat, so you tell him to sit, he decides not to sit, so he doesn't receive the reward.</p><h3>Social Learning</h3><p>Social learning is whereby an animal learns by copying or mimicking the behavior of others. This can be a powerful tool to use when training a dog, especially if you have access to a very well-behaved dog that can act as a model.</p><h2>How does this apply to your brain?<br></h2><p>The problem you have with Brain that I’ve mentioned earlier is a combination of two sub-problems. (1) Obedience: how to get Brain to listen to you and do what you ask. (2) Focus: once you get Brain’s attention, and he starts doing what you have asked, how to make sure he won’t quit after 8 seconds or whenever a random thing tries to get his attention.</p><h3>Obedience</h3><p>If you want to sit to do some work, Brain won’t naturally sit quietly and let you do it. Brain wants to check social media, watch Youtube videos, and keep refreshing your email inbox in case you get a new email so he can rip it up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You could try to talk some sense to him and convince him to let you work, but good luck with that. Instead, as Pavlov’s experiment suggests, you could train Brain by combining a <strong>natural stimulus</strong> with an <strong>unconditioned stimulus, </strong>and associate it to an <strong>unconditioned response</strong>.<br></p><p>For example, Brain loves coffee, when you offer him coffee (unconditioned stimulus), Brain gets excited (unconditioned response). Let’s say you want Brain to get excited when you sit down to write your morning pages or your daily todo list (which usually he doesn't like doing). In this case, the natural stimulus could be something like sitting down on your desk and saying: “Hey Brain, let’s sit down for 20 minutes and do XYZ”. You would say that while sipping your brewed delicious coffee to create the connection between enjoying coffee and getting something done.<br></p><p>To compare this to Pavlov’s experiment, saying “Hey Brain, let’s do XYZ” is like ringing the bell, the coffee is the treat, and the excitement that follows is the desired response. Eventually, If you repeat this enough times, “Let’s do XYZ” will become the <em>conditioned stimulus</em> and you will get the same excitement as the <em>conditioned response</em> even without having the coffee treat!<br></p><p>Of course, things may not go as smoothly as you hope. Making Brain give you the chance to be productive is just the first step and that doesn’t mean you will actually get the work done. To make sure that happens, we need to use the other training method to deal with the focus problem.</p><h3>Focus</h3><p>By now, you have Brain listening to what you say and let you start working on that important task you have to finish. However, Brain’s attention span is as short as 8 seconds as some studies suggest. How do you keep Brain engaged? Since you know Brain very well, you know how much he loves chocolate and to play PUBG on the phone. So you decided to take advantage of that, by using the four quadrants of <strong>Operant Conditioning</strong>, to maximise the possibility of getting Brain to perform with reliable obedience.<br></p><p>To use <strong>positive reinforcement </strong>you could tell Brain something like: “If we work on this task for 25 minutes without interruption you can have a piece of chocolate”. You want to reinforce the good behaviour of focus by rewarding it with chocolate.<br></p><p>Don’t confuse this with <strong>negative reinforcement</strong>. If Brain wants to play PUBG, and you say: “you can play PUBG but we have to finish today’s blog post first”. Here you are turning a pressure on, and when Brains complies your turn it off.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two very important things to remember when using negative reinforcement: (1) once the pressure is turned on, it can’t be turned off until Brain complies. If you told Brain that he can play after you finish the blog post, but you don’t finish it and you let him play, it defeats the entire purpose. (2) Once Brain complies, the pressure must immediately be turned off. If you finished your blog post don’t ask Brain for more work, doing so will make this method less effective later on.<br></p><p>For <strong>positive punishment, </strong>you may need the help of other people. For example,<strong> </strong>if you notice that Brain is spending a lot of time playing video games, you could ask your friend or partner to help you “punish” Brain, and force you to do more cleaning duties like doing the dishes. And if they catch you playing, you have to do 50 jumping jacks. The point is that an unpleasant consequence is introduced to the subject to discourage this behavior.<br></p><p>If after all of&nbsp; that Brain still didn’t comply, you can delete the game from your phone, or ask a friend to change your account password. That would be an example for <strong>negative punishment</strong>, you are taking something of value away.<br></p><p>Finally, to strengthen all the new behaviours you could use <em>Social Learning</em>. Take Brain and hang out with other people who have trained “Brains”. Either it’s a local group of friends or an online community. Interacting with other well-behaving “Brains” will help your Brain to do less of the bad behaviours and more of the good ones.</p><h2>🧠 = 🐶 ?</h2><p>We want to believe so bad that we are rational beings, but that simply is not true. The same way a dog’s decisions are driven by impulse, most of your decisions are too as well. If you want to control your actions you need to control the impulses behind them. And the same way you can train a dog to do progressively more complex behaviors and tasks, so too can you train your brain to take on more and more disciplined activities.<br></p><p>Hopefully, by using the brain-dog analogy, you can see that there is progress to be made and it will take time and patience. As you don’t expect your dog to know how to spin or wave on day one, you shouldn’t expect your brain to be super focused and productive without training. So don’t forget to be nice to yourself and your inner-dog.</p><p>📕 This chapter is part of my upcoming book <em>“TL;DR — a book about productivity by a procrastination master”</em>.

<h2>What is the GRONE project?</h2>



<p>The GRONE is a waste management technology that functions as a municipal solid waste (MSW) sorting center and power plant. The GRONE has a variety of streamlined operations to it. In June 2016, Human Unitec Intl. acquired 100% intellectual rights for these technologies applied to plastic and used tire recycling.</p>



<p>Some notable GRONE applications include,</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Energy transference from the system that can power water desalination plants.</li><li>Using the waste as a fuel source for standalone operations.</li></ol>



<p>The goal of the GRONE is to eliminate the need for landfills. An action we are seeing a push on Political and Socio-Cultural fronts globally.</p>



<h3>Check out the recent <a href="https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/money/business/municipal-review-committee-is-removing-75-of-its-waste-from-landfills/97-70417ff9-ac85-4d69-9d49-6af734a28bca">redirection of over 100 cities trash</a> to an MSW plant in Maine!</h3>



<hr>



<h4>How is Human Unitec International (HMNU) capitalizing on the GRONE?</h4>



<p>HMNU struck a $40.8m binding purchase agreement with Palladium Investments SA, of Lugano, Switzerland on June 11, 2020, to build the first GRONE plant in Saudi Arabia. This purchase agreement includes six plants.</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HMNU/news/story?e&amp;id=1633883">June 29<sup>th</sup> release</a>, HMNU has successfully launched their prototype for a 10-ton capacity recycling plant with Grupo Sedda of Porto Torres. This plant is currently conducting operations for <span>tire recycling</span>. <span>The average annual net income to be generated is $1.8m USD.</span> With a budgeted investment cap at only $2m.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HMNU/news/story?e&amp;id=1636270">June, 30<sup>th</sup></a> an extension was made to include a second GRONE purchase. However, this one is for <span>plastic recycling</span>, with a 10-ton max for electricity production.</p>



<p>Group Sedda founder, Andrea Sedda commented on the deal, “We are very happy to have the chance to build this fantastic equipment in Sardinia. The GRONE plant represents a significant evolution in the growth of the renewable green energy for our country and our environment. Economically, a 10 tons plant is able to produce up to 8 tons of green eco diesel a day, equal to 12,600,000 KW/year or over Euros (€) 2,772,000 in net revenues.”</p>



<p><span>The combined purchase price with Group Sedda’s order of 2 GRONE plants exceeds $3.9m USD</span></p>



<p>Most recently, Human Unitec revealed a <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HMNU/news/story?e&amp;id=1648843">purchase agreement</a> for a Biomass Plant located in Cecina, Italy. This purchase agreement is significant because of the standing partnership with GSE.  The company stated, “This Biomass plant has an official 20 year contract with GSE, a governmental financial institution, where GSE has contracted to purchase 100% of the energy that the plant is and will be producing.” </p>



<p>The biomass plant is currently generating €250,000 or about $289,000 in annual income. </p>



<p>Human Unitec priced the Biomass plant at €800,000 &gt; About $925,000 USD. </p>

<p><strong>PHP is a dynamically typed scripting language</strong> and until the year
of 2015 php had no support for statically declared types at all. One
could cast to scalar types explicitly in the code, but declaring scalar
types in methods and functions signatures wasn't a thing until PHP 7.0
with the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5">Scalar Type Declarations</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types">Return Type Declarations</a> rfcs.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that from version 7.0 PHP became a statically typed
language, though. <strong>It has type hinting that can be analyzed statically</strong>
but <strong>it still supports dynamic types</strong> and even allows them to be mixed.
See the example below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function returnsInt(): int
{
  return '100';
}</code></pre>
<p>No doubt that <strong>there's a type mismatch there</strong>. The return type is
supposed to be <em>int</em> and the returned type is in fact a <em>string</em>. Now,
what PHP does there is to automatically transform the token '100'
into an integer in order to return the required type. Even though it
seems to have an extra cost, it doesn't. PHP's type juggling is <em>nearly</em>
cost-free in many cases.</p>
<p>To better clarify how the language deals with types I'll split this article
into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#union-types">Union Types</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-juggling">PHP's type juggling</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-modes">PHP type modes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions on what to add here, feel free to
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">reach out to me on twitter</a> or opening an issue on
github.</p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</h2>
<p>PHP's type system is very simplified when it comes to language features.
For example there's no <em>char</em> type, or <em>unsigned</em> types or even <em>int8</em>,
<em>int16</em>, <em>int32</em>, <em>int64</em>...</p>
<p>The <em>char</em> type is simplified to a string type and all <em>integer</em> variations
are simplified into an <em>integer</em> type. Whether that's a good or bad thing, is
up to you.</p>
<p>One can always inspect a variable's type using the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> function or using
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a> function and
checking its output.</p>
<p>PHP comes with three different kinds of types: <strong>scalar types</strong>, <strong>compound types</strong>
and <strong>special types</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scalar types</h3>
<p>Scalar types are the bare bones of the language and they are four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean (<code>bool</code> | <code>boolean</code>)</li>
<li>Integer (<code>int</code> | <code>integer</code>)</li>
<li>Float (<code>float</code> | <code>double</code>)</li>
<li>String (<code>string</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition scalar types do not carry behaviour or state with themselves.
Expressions like <code>100-&gt;toString()</code> or <code>'thephp.website'::length()</code> are invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: scalar values do not have behaviour or state, they just represent
a value.</strong></p>
<h3>Compound types</h3>
<p>Compound types are much more interesting because even though they are very similar
to the scalar type, <strong>each one of the four compound types carry different syntactic
capabilities.</strong></p>
<p>The four compound types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#compound-type-array">array</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-object">object</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-callable">callable</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-iterable">iterable</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compound-type-array">The array compound type</h4>
<p>An array is in fact a hashmap, built-in to the language. Meaning that it stores
values in a <strong>key =&gt; value</strong> manner. Even if you use it purely as a vector.</p>
<p>Arrays are very flexible structures when it comes to size, internal types and
key-value mapping. The examples below are all valid arrays:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$vec = [0, 1, 2];
// $vec[1] is int(1)

$map = ['a' =&gt; 1, 'b' =&gt; 2];
// $map['a'] is int(1)

$map_ish = ['a' =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 2];
// $map_ish['a'] is int(1)
// $map_ish[0] =&gt; is int(2)</code></pre>
<p>Unlike C, php won't require you to define an array's size before creating it.
This of course comes with a memory consumption cost: the bigger your array size,
the more memory you'll consume in crazy proportions (in fact, arrays are allocated in powers of two).
How this consumption works is out of the scope of this article,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">feel free to ping me if you'd like to hear more</a>.</p>
<p>In case you're curious about this statement, the video below presents some charts
and further insights on arrays vs. object memory profiles.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>As you'll see bellow, arrays are also considered to be of type <em>iterable</em>, meaning
that you can iterate over them using a <em>foreach</em> loop. But they also provide
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php">specific functions that can manipulate their internal pointers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: array is an extremely flexible compound type that can be perceived
as a HashMap and is also considered an iterable type.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-object">The object compound type</h4>
<p>Due to php's architecture, the <em>object</em> compound type normally has a much lower memory
consumption profile when compared with arrays. That's because <em>normally</em> one would use
the object type by creating instances of classes.</p>
<p>Objects can carry state and behaviour. Meaning that php will offer dereferencing
language structs to access an object's internals. The snippet below illustrates
a php object's derefs:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  private const A = 1;
  public int $property = 0;
  public function method(): void {}
}

$obj = new MyClass();
// $obj is object(MyClass)
// $obj::A is int(1)
// $obj-&gt;property is int(0)
// $obj-&gt;method() is null</code></pre>
<p>An object can also be normally created as a result of a type cast from an array.
Transforming an array's keys into objects property names. Such cast will always
result in an <code>object(stdClass)</code> type.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) ['a' =&gt; 1];
// $obj is object(stdClass)
// $obj-&gt;a is int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Important to notice that casting an array with numeric keys into an object is valid,
but one can't dereference its value because property names may not start with numbers.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) [0, 1]; // Legal
$obj-&gt;0; // Illegal</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: objects normally have lower memory profiles than arrays, they carry
state and behaviour, they all inherit from stdClass and can be created by casting an
array.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-callable">The callable compound type</h4>
<p>A callable in php is anything that can be called (oh don't you say!!) with parenthesis
or with the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php">call_user_func()</a>
function. In other words, a callable can fulfil the responsibility of what we know as
functions. Functions and methods are always callables. Objects and classes may also become
callables.</p>
<p>A callable can, by definition, have its reference stored in a variable. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$callable = 'strlen';</code></pre>
<p>What? But that's a string, no?</p>
<p>Well, yes. But it can be coerced into a callable if necessary. Like below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function callACallable(
  callable $f
): int {
  return $f('thephp.website');
}

$callable = 'strlen';

var_dump(
  $callable('thephp.website')
);
// int(14)

var_dump(
  callACallable($callable)
);
// int(14)</code></pre>
<p>Callables may also point to object methods:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  public function myMethod(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
var_dump([$obj, 'myMethod']());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Looks odd? I know it looks like an array. In fact it is. Unless you name it a callable 👀</p>
<p>This kind of callable above (object-method reference) is very interesting because
<strong>you can call private or protected methods</strong> with it <strong>if you're inside the class' scope.</strong>
Otherwise you may only call public methods with it.</p>
<p>Also classes that implement
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.invoke">the __invoke() magic method</a>,
automatically transform their instances into callables themselves. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyCallableClass
{
  public function __invoke(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyCallableClass();
var_dump($obj());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: callables hold reference to functions or methods and can be
constructed in different ways.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-iterable">The iterable compound type</h4>
<p>Iterables are simpler to explain: they are by definition an array or an instance of
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php">Traversable interface</a>. The
main thing of an iterable is that it can be used in a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php">foreach() loop</a>, with a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php#control-structures.yield.from">yield from statement</a>
or with <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spread_operator_for_array">spread operator</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of iterables are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function generator_function(): Generator
{
  // ...
};

// All variables here are iterables
$a = [0, 1, 2];
$b = generator_function();
$c = new ArrayObject();</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: if you can fit it in a foreach(), it is an iterable.</strong></p>
<h3>Special Types</h3>
<p>There are two special types. And the biggest reason why they're called special, is that
<strong>you can't cast these types</strong>. The special types are both the <strong>resource</strong> type and
the <strong>NULL</strong> type.</p>
<p><strong>A resource represents a handle to an external resource</strong>. It can be a file handle,
an I/O stream or a database connection handle. You may guess now why you can't convert
a resource to any other type.</p>
<p><strong>The null type represents a null value</strong>. Meaning that a variable holding NULL was not
initialized, assigned to NULL or unset during runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: a special typed value can't be casted to anything.</strong></p>
<h3>What about class instances?</h3>
<p>Class instances have the type <code>object</code> and will always be presented like so. Executing
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> on an object will always return
a <code>string("object")</code> and calling <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a>
on an object will always print its value using the <code>object(ClassName)</code> notation. If you need
to fetch an object's class as a string, use the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class">get_class()</a> function.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = new stdClass();

echo gettype($obj);
// object

var_dump($obj);
// object(stdClass)#1 (0) {
// ...

echo get_class($obj);
// \stdClass</code></pre>
<h2 id="type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</h2>
<p>There are different "operations" one can do with PHP when it comes to types. I believe
it is important to clearly state them here so that we don't mix things up later on.</p>
<h3>Type juggling: type casting and coercion</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, here are three important definitions we need keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type conversion</strong> means to transform a type from A to B. For example: from integer to float.</li>
<li><strong>Type cast</strong> means to <strong>manually</strong> or <strong>explicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$hundred = (int) 100.0</code>. (<code>float(100.0)</code> became <code>int(100)</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type coercion</strong> means to <strong>implicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$twenty = 10 + '10 bananas';</code>. (<code>string("10 bananas")</code> became <code>int(10)</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Being that said, the following sections explain how it happens in php. Later on you'll find
more information on Type Juggling.</p>
<h4>Type casting</h4>
<p>Similar to what Java does, php allows type casting. Meaning that when a variable points to
a value that can be casted to a different type, it allows manual (explicit) type conversion.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. What!? 🤨</p>
<p>Given a variable <code>$hundred</code> holding a <code>string("100")</code> its value may be manually converted (casted)
to become an <code>int(100)</code> or a <code>float(100.00)</code> - or any other scalar type or one of compound
types <em>array</em> or <em>object</em>.</p>
<p>The following snippet works just fine in PHP and is very similar to Java:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$hundred = (int) '100';
// $hundred is now int(100)</code></pre>
<p>Now, one thing Java does and is completely illegal on php code, is to …</p></iframe></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9357"><div><div><div><h2>Amazon’s venture capital fund accused of investing in small companies just to steal their ideas</h2><p>Jeff Bezos’ owned world’s biggest eCommerce firm is actually a predator! Amazon is reportedly using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon is accused of investing in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. The e-commerce retailer then uses this confidential information to launch its own service based on such data.</p><p>According to a report in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249">Wall Street Journal(Paywall)</a>, Amazon.com’s venture-capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information. Four years later the marketplace launched a similar artificial intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does.</p><p>DefinedCrowd founder and CEO Daniela Braga has accused Amazon of stealing their concept to launch its own product. Amazon recently launched a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) product called A2I. DefinedCrowd CEO says that it is completely based on their product and competes directly with them. And all this under the garb of venture capital funding.</p><p>Another company that suffered a similar fate was LivingSocial. LivingSocial officials met with Amazon’s venture capital firm to discuss a potential investment. At the end of the talks, Amazon purchased 30 percent of LivingSocial equity. After buying the share in LivingSocial, Amazon requested access to proprietary LivingSocial data. In a few months, Amazon started reaching out to its own clients offering better deals for similar products.</p><p>Even Amazon’s Echo seems to have been developed using this predatory thieving. A company that built Ubi, a smart speaker was in talks with Amazon for seed funding. The Ubi officials met with Amazo several times to discuss funding and concepts. It was just a matter of days before Amazon launched a similar product to Ubi- Amazon’s Echo. Due to the Echo launch, Ubi has all but disappeared.</p><p>WSJ report says that many startup founders claimed that after Amazon launched rival products their businesses collapsed. Some say they were being forced to downsize their companies due to Amazon’s competition.</p><p>Amazon has refused to comment on the predatory nature of its venture capital fund. Amazon says that such funding meetings are confidential in nature. Amazon, however, added that information obtained from such meetings is not used to build competing products, noting that any such claims are typically resolved in court.</p><p>“For 26 years, we’ve pioneered many features, products, and even whole new categories. From amazon.com itself to Kindle to Echo to AWS, few companies can claim a track record for innovation that rivals Amazon’s,” an Amazon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-startup-investment-competitors-wsj-report-echo-nucleus-ubi-2020-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. “Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build. Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”</p><p>While court decisions may take a long time and many of these startups are too small to fight with a giant like Amazon armed with a battery of A-list lawyers, it is answerable to the US anti-trust body which it will be facing next week. The Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos will have to testify in the official hearing scheduled for Monday in front of the House Judiciary Committee.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>In an industry saturated with upbeat bubblegum pop beats, it’s difficult to stand out or add any layer of depth: but Emily Vu does just that. You may know her as a teen Tik Tok sensation, having amassed over 1.4 million followers on the platform, accompanied by a fervent 386k on Instagram, but the California-native proves she’s more than just a viral star in the latest of her recent string of releases, ‘Just Wait’. </p>



<p>Having already achieved huge success with her first original single debuted back in October 2019 and now boasting an intimidating 1.3 million streams on Spotify, Emily has been busy at work, in a time where most of us our stuck in a productivity rut, with the release of her 4th track in just a couple of months. Overlaying a breezy summer beat, the singer songwriter laments on past relationships through a reel of introspective lyricism and youthful vocals. I spoke to Emily following the release of ‘Just Wait’ to explore the approach behind it:</p>



<p><strong><em>‘Just Wait’ has been described as exploring the vulnerability of falling in love – a common theme throughout your music. Where do you draw your inspiration from here?</em></strong></p>



<p>I only write songs from my own experience so I guess you could say my inspiration comes from myself and all the different relationships I’ve been in.</p>



<p><strong><em>The song itself is lighthearted and airy, whereas the lyrics are slightly more somber in contrast. What was the songwriting process behind this?</em></strong></p>



<p>I was in a session with my producer SZNS and usually when we work together he’ll take some time to produce the instrumental before we start writing. While he was producing it out, I had a chorus melody stuck in my head, so I just sat down and started writing it. We both loved it and continued to work on it from there.</p>



<p><strong><em>What’s been the biggest step change for you as an artist since your first release last year in comparison to ‘Just Wait’?</em></strong></p>



<p>I think my voice has evolved since my first ever release. Part of that stems from my voice getting better over time, but I also think a big portion of it is learning to sing with the sound I want and how I want listeners to connect with my music.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you have any plans to release an EP with your recent body of work?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, very soon! I’m currently working on some big projects!</p>



<p><strong><em>Being a young person in music is undoubtedly an enormous challenge. What motivated you to pursue music? What challenges have you faced in navigating the industry?</em></strong></p>



<p>The thing that motivates me to pursue music is my love for it. I love music and I can never really see myself doing anything else. As a young artist, I’ve definitely faced the challenge of getting other people in the industry to take me seriously.</p>



<p><strong><em>How has the response to your music been in your view?</em></strong></p>



<p>The response has been amazing! I get tons of messages from fans telling me how a song has helped them through a tough time and it truly warms my heart.</p>



<p><strong><em>Who or what are your main inspirations musically, and how has this influenced your own style?</em></strong></p>



<p>Lauv is an artist that I really look up to. I’ve been listening to his music for years.</p>



<p><strong><em>In a previous interview you mentioned hating having to play the piano when you were younger, but regaining a love for it after playing it your way. How has your experience with music when you were younger shaped your artistry today?</em></strong></p>



<p>I think that having prior knowledge of music and playing instruments has helped me pick things up quicker in the studio. I recognize keys and tempos so much more easily.</p>



<p><strong><em>Mean Muse Magazine is a platform dedicated to women &amp; non-binary people in music to showcase their talent where they’re often underrepresented. When was the first time you saw someone in music you identified with or who resonated with you?</em></strong></p>



<p>The first artist I really resonated with was Hayley Kiyoko. I remember stumbling across her music video for “Girls Like Girls” and falling in love with her music.</p>



<p><strong><em>You’re of course very active on social media, with a strong following across major platforms, particularly Tik Tok. Would you say that social media has been more of a help or hindrance in your career to date given the misrepresentative labels that can come with being seen as just a ‘TikTok artist’?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I can say it’s been both helpful and a burden, but nevertheless I’ll always be thankful for the platform I’ve been given.</p>



<p><strong><em>Final question: we always love being put onto new music – who are you listening to right now?</em></strong></p>



<p>My favorite artist right now is SAINt JHN. You should definitely listen to “Selfish” and “Monica Lewinsky”!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Listen to ‘Just Wait’ here:</strong></p>







<p><strong>Follow Emily Vu on social media:</strong></p>

<p> The WTTC, a council that represents private-sector travel and tourism, created the Safe Travels stamp to allow tourists to identify destinations and businesses around the world that have adopted the global standardised health and hygiene protocols.</p> 
<p>The stamp provides guidance to travel providers and travellers about the new approach to health, hygiene, deep cleansing and physical distancing, in the “new normal” of a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
<p> The protocols were devised following the experience of WTTC members dealing with Covid-19 and based on guidelines from the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and control.</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.unwto.org/">The United Nations World Tourism Organisation</a> has welcomed the WTTC Safe Travels stamp, which makes the safety and hygiene of travellers a top priority.</p> 

<p>“As we reopen Dubai’s doors to tourism and welcome our international visitors back to the city, our foremost priority is their well-being, achieved through stringent hygiene and safety protocols that have been deployed across all tourist touch points,” Helal Saeed Almarri, director general, Dubai’s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism) said. </p>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>IPv6 is coming, but we still have to use IPv4 also. In other words, we have to keep use IPv4/IPv6 dual stack environment. Also, ISPs use different aggregators for IPv4 and IPv6 (For example, PPPoE for IPv4, IPoE for IPv6). And their capacity and performance are different. As a result, connections speed of  IPv4 and IPv6 are different.</p>



<p>I’ll talk the statistics of this player at next APNIC conference (IPv6 deployment session). Please play the videos.</p>



<h2>IPv4 IPv6 Multi Protocol Media Player</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.kosho.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/46mplayer.png" alt=""></figure>



<h3>Speed comparison</h3>



<p>The player downloads media chunks by IPv4 and IPv6 (e.g. media001.ts by IPv4, media002.ts by IPv6, media003.ts by IPv4, media004.ts by IPv6 …) and calculate the download speeds. </p>



<h3>Protocol selection</h3>



<p>After the comparison, the player use the faster protocol. There are 2 modes:</p>



<ul><li>Initial check mode<ul><li>The player compares the protocols during the first segments. After that, the player keeps using the faster protocol.</li></ul></li><li>Continuous check mode<ul><li>The player compares the protocols during the first segments. After that, the player uses both protocols by the following rate (e.g.) to get the latest speeds.<ul><li>faster protocol: 4</li><li>slower protocol: 1</li></ul></li><li>The reason of this mode: media streaming could keep long (For example TV streaming would continue to be watched for several hours).  Protocol speeds could be changed during the hours.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>I made a simple plugin (hls-46.js) for hls.js. Github page will be available soon.</p>



<h2>Sample</h2>



<p>Caution: all samples are only available for IPv6:</p>



<ul><li>Simple speed comparison<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp0.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp0.html</a></li></ul><ul><li>This sample only uses the plugin for speed display. IPv4/IPv6 mixed play uses the media playlist (<a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/tears-2m-5-mixed.m3u8">tears-2m-2-mixed.m3u8</a>) has the following entries:<ul><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv6.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears000.ts</li><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv4.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears001.ts</li><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv6.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears002.ts</li><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv4.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears003.ts</li><li>…</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Speed comparison by plugin<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp1.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp1.html</a></li><li>This sample uses the normal playlist (<a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/tears-2m-2-template.m3u8">tears-2m-2-template.m3u8</a>) and the plugin adds the hosts (ipv4.jpcdn.jp, ipv6.jpcdn.jp) one by one.</li></ul></li><li>Protocol selection (Initial check mode)<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn1.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn1.html</a></li></ul></li><li>Protocol selection (Continuous check mode)<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn2.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn2.html</a></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The player has console output (Browser debug window: F12) that shows each download speeds.</p>

              <p>Bounding boxes are one of the most popular—and recognized tools when it comes to image processing for image and video annotation projects.<br></p><p>Image processing is one of the main reasons why computer vision continues to improve and drive innovative AI-based technologies. From self-driving cars to facial recognition technology—computer vision applications are the face of new tech. <br></p><p>But image processing can’t be as simple as drawing rectangles around objects—right? How do bounding boxes work, and what are the key elements that make this such a useful tool for annotators looking to create reliable datasets?</p><h2 id="bounding-box-image-processing-what-you-need-to-know">Bounding Box Image Processing: What You Need to Know</h2><p>A bounding box is an imaginary rectangle that serves as a point of reference for object detection and creates a collision box for that object. <br></p><p>Data annotators draw these rectangles over images, outlining the object of interest within each image by defining its X and Y coordinates. This makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to find what they’re looking for, determine collision paths, and conserves valuable computing resources. <br></p><p>Bounding boxes are one of the most popular image annotation techniques in deep learning. Compared to other image processing methods, this method can reduce costs and increase annotation efficiency.</p><h2 id="using-bounding-boxes-for-object-detection">Using Bounding Boxes for Object Detection</h2><p>But how does object detection work in relation to bounding boxes? Answering this question requires looking at object detection as two components: object classification and object localization. In other words, to detect an object in an image, the computer needs to know what it is and where it is. <br></p><p>Take self-driving cars as an example. An annotator will draw bounding boxes around other vehicles and label them. This helps train an algorithm to understand what vehicles look like. Annotating objects such as vehicles, traffic signals, and pedestrians makes it possible for autonomous vehicles to maneuver busy streets safely. Self-driving car perception models rely heavily on bounding boxes to make this possible.<br></p><p>However, it’s important to note that a single bounding box doesn’t guarantee a perfect prediction rate. Enhanced object detection requires many bounding boxes in combination with data augmentation techniques.</p><h2 id="common-use-cases-for-bounding-boxes">Common Use Cases for Bounding Boxes</h2><p>There are a variety of use cases for image processing and bounding boxes. Some of the more popular ones include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/autonomous-vehicle.php">Self-driving cars</a></li><li>Insurance claims</li><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/retail.php">Ecommerce</a></li><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/agriculture.php">Agriculture</a></li><li>Healthcare<br></li></ul><p>Bounding boxes are used in all of these areas to train algorithms to identify patterns.

            <p>“I’m trying to go down a bottomless pit. I’ll never make it till the end.”</p>
<p>That’s what I thought when I tried to create my own video game. I was young, beautiful, and I was struggling to use <code>for</code> loops and <code>arrays</code> at the same time.
There was so much to learn!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found the strength to continue. More and more, the concepts behind programming began to make sense. From there, learning wasn’t a chore anymore, but an intrepid journey. Going through a book about C and trying to create my own adventure on MS-DOS was a crazy Indiana Jone’s-like discovery I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>My first video game wasn’t great, but it was mine. It was <em>my</em> creation. Yet, what I remember today, with a tear in my left eye, is not the result, but the learning process itself. It was these “Aha!” moments which brought me the most joy!</p>
<p>I love learning. For a long, long time. That’s why I tried, through the years, to make my learning gradually more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Learning is essential for developers. We need to learn about the new breakthroughs, discoveries, and changes in the industry.</p>
<p>We need to learn about our history, to know what’s really new, what’s not, and what to do with it, <em>in what context</em>.</p>
<p>We need to learn about the business domain of the company we’re working with.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to better communicates with our teammates.</p>
<p>We need to learn about what our customers really want.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, this article will brush over the wide subject of learning, as a developer. We’ll try to answer these questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s learning?</li>
<li>Why do we learn? Should learning serve a goal?</li>
<li>How to avoid ineffective learning methods, procrastination, and distractions?</li>
<li>Should we have a mentor or learn by ourselves?</li>
<li>Is practice only makes perfect?</li>
<li>How to test ourselves to avoid the illusion of competence?</li>
<li>Are feedback important? What kind of feedback can you get? What feedback should you be interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to dive? Good. Take your machete and let’s go together through the Deep Jungle of Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="whats-learning">What’s learning?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can be very surprised of the meaning of common words. Especially if we never question their definitions.</p>
<p>For example, I’m always surprised to hear people saying that learning is only a question of memory. It’s not wrong, but it’s incomplete.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxford dictionary</a>, learning means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us clues about how to learn (study, experience, or being taught), but not really about the meaning of “acquisition of knowledge”.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the definition of <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can already see, thanks to these definitions, two main fundamentals for learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding</li>
<li>Remembering (acquisition)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll add a third one:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Transfer is applying the knowledge from the learning context to another context. For example, it could be applying the programming knowledge your learned at school to the side project you always dreamt to build.</p>
<p>Transfer is not a necessity for learning. After all, you can understand and remember something without ever using what you learned.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, we learn in hope to apply the knowledge acquired. That’s why it’s still a major component of our learning experiences.</p>
<h2 id="why-learning">Why Learning?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/learn-good.jpg" alt="There is only good in learning">
</picture>



<h3 id="enriching-your-life">Enriching Your Life</h3>
<p>Learning will enrich your life in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your opinions will evolve.</li>
<li>Your vision on the world will change.</li>
<li>You’ll feel strong connections with people who share your interests, creating passionate and mind-binding conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning can open doors in your professional life:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you climbing the corporate ladder.</li>
<li>It can help you to negotiate a better salary. After all, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge workers</a>: our worth is <em>partly</em> our knowledge.</li>
<li>It will create opportunities for <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/guide-debate-software-developer-skill/">healthy debates with your fellow colleagues</a>.</li>
<li>Your CTO might call you <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">“Rockstar” or “Ninja”</a> too, you lucky pit of knowledge!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-with-or-without-goals">Learning With or Without Goals?</h3>
<p>When you try to learn something, it’s useful to have concrete goals you want to achieve with the knowledge acquired. These goals could be a good occasion to <em>transfer</em> your knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, you want to learn programming because you always dreamt to create a revolutionary video game, where you can break bricks with a ball. Maybe you want to learn what’s the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/">DRY principle</a>, to finally refactor your favorite legacy application.</p>
<p>Without meaningful goals, it will be difficult to be motivated in the long run. Learning is not easy. Understanding can be a daunting task (depending of what you learn), remembering even more so, and transfer is maybe the worst of all.</p>
<p>It takes time, too. That’s why being able to reach concrete goals with your new skills and knowledge can be very satisfying. It will give you the needed motivation to continue on your learning path.</p>
<p>It’s even more true when you try to learn complex topics. Your motivation is something you should try to assess and even measure along the way, to see if you need to boost it by making (and finishing) something important to you.</p>
<p>It’s always possible to learn for the sake of learning. Heck, I do it quite a lot myself. Yet, you need to have a good confidence on your motivation, and you need to be aware of the benefits of the learning journey itself.</p>
<p>If you have difficulties to find concrete ideas and goals where you can transfer your new knowledge, I wrote a whole article about techniques <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/generate-programming-side-project-ideas/">to generate project ideas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-deep-do-you-want-to-go">How Deep Do You Want to Go?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/experts.jpg" alt="Being an expert is not necessarily your goal">
</picture>



<p>Now that you have your goals, you need to decide <em>how much</em> you want to learn.</p>
<p>After all, you don’t need to be an expert in everything.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowledge acquisition is not like buying a new table for your living room. You need some maintenance not to forget the knowledge and skills acquired.</p>
<p>It means that you need to constantly refresh your knowledge and skills, for everything you want to be an expert at. It takes time, energy, and require, again, a lot of motivation.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that your life’s dream is to write a PHP script to rename automatically thousands of your holidays pictures. You don’t need to be a PHP evangelist to answer your needs. Trying to understand superficially how PHP works to accomplish what you want might be enough.</p>
<p>Superficial learning works well if you don’t have any goal, too. You can read about programming paradigms for example, by pure curiosity, to have a global overview of all of them. You can still dive deeper if you wish later.</p>
<p>Beyond the superficial, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreyfus model of competence</a> can help you deciding how competent you want to become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice</strong> - Shallow understanding, or no understanding at all.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> - Can make things works, often rely on following a series of steps.</li>
<li><strong>Competent</strong> - Can spot the roots of problems (background understanding), know all the rules and can select a rule depending of the situation. Still make many mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Proficient</strong> - Very conscious about performance, know perfectly what approaches to take in what situation.</li>
<li><strong>Expert</strong> - Intuition very well developed, apply his skills without thoughts, performances look magical.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1nzADdV6zk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose your destiny</a>, depending on your needs!</p>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/learning-not-playing.jpg" alt="You need to prepare your environment to learn efficiently">
</picture>



<p>Let’s see now how you should prepare yourself before learning anything.</p>
<p>The following advice won’t change your life from one day to another. You need to work on it, actively seeking to apply these advice, day after day. The rewards are, however, huge. I promise.</p>
<h3 id="the-mistakes-to-avoid">The Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>Let’s go back years in your past, when you were young, innocent, and not a caffeine junky yet.</p>
<p>You’re at school. The teacher is speaking about whatever subject he wants you to learn. His tone is monotonous, he doesn’t believe in what he’s saying, you think about what you’ll eat at lunch.</p>
<p>You’re bored.</p>
<p>The seconds feel like minutes. Minutes feel like hours. You can’t do anything, except waiting. Will it ever end? Will you feel joy again? Is it the end of time?</p>
<p>Finally, against all odds, the course end. The teacher ask you to learn a new chapter of your book. He will test you next time.</p>
<p>At home, you read again and again the learning material. You have difficulties to concentrate, but you’re a serious boy (or girl), so you push yourself through. After five reading, you judge yourself good enough to pass the next test.</p>
<p>You close your book, satisfied with yourself, and switch on the TV, because Youtube might not exist yet.</p>
<p>What I just described is the worst way to learn something. <em>Passively</em> listening to somebody, then <em>passively</em> going through some learning materials might teach you something, but very, very slowly. You don’t need to be in a class for that: just switch on Youtube and consume <em>passively</em> any video on programming.</p>
<p>When you close your book after your passive learning, you think you learned something. Yet, when you’ll pass your test, you’ll understand that you really didn’t.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>illusion of competence</strong>: we have often the <em>impression</em> we learned something, even if we didn’t.</p>
<p>You should spend most of your time <em>actively learning</em>. You need to be an actor in your own learning, not only consuming it like you would consume Netflix.</p>
<p>I would compare active learning as playing a video game. Yes, I was a video game junky.</p>
<p>When you play, you’re actively doing something. Consequently, I’m sure you can remember many more video games than what you read in your last books.</p>
<p>This is due to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Video games are fun. You can make your learning experience fun, too. More you’ll learn what you love, more you’ll like the process of learning.</li>
<li>Playing is an active endeavor, not a passive one.</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, before actively learning, you need …</p></section></article></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people ask me why I chose not to pursue a PhD directly after college. I figured I might as well centralize my thoughts in one place. This essay is for computer science or technical grads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested in machine learning</li>
<li>Enjoy working on hard, unsolved technical challenges</li>
<li>Possibly choosing between research or industry</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who deeply enjoys thinking about and coding solutions to open-ended research questions, I genuinely considered going to a PhD program. To come to a decision, I spent a while pondering why many students with research experience don’t pursue a PhD directly after undergrad. I think there are many reasons why people don’t go directly to PhD programs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effort</em>: it’s a lot of work to write applications for many schools, get solid recommendation letters, pay a lot of money in application fees, go through interviews, align with professors, secure funding, and more.</li>
<li><em>Comfort</em>: industry perks and salaries can be more attractive than graduate school stipends and long work hours.</li>
<li><em>Inertia</em>: if you’re not absolutely sure it’s right for you, the thought of switching trajectories midway into the program is very anxiety-provoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I could put in the effort to apply and would enjoy a PhD program if I got in, but I still didn’t know what to do. Delaying the decision didn’t feel optimal either, since even if I worked in industry for a few years before going to a PhD program, I didn’t think I’d easily accustom to a large pay cut and working on problem sets again. Understandably, the PhD vs Industry decision caused me a lot of stress! Halfway through my senior year, I wrote down some pros and cons for each choice. In practice, an industry job for me meant working at a startup since I didn’t really enjoy my engineering internships at large companies. </p>
<p>Here, I discuss the raw pros and cons of pursuing a PhD and pros and cons of joining an early-stage machine learning startup. I wrote these in my journal in January 2019, and I provide some relevant commentary from my current self as a machine learning engineer (July 2020) in the nested bullets.</p>
<h2>Pros of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can prioritize my curiosity and have the freedom to learn about what I find intellectually engaging.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I’ve been at a startup, although I can still be curious about many things, I have to work on things that provide business value. The ability to not be constrained by industry value is a real pro here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can deeply hone technical expertise and have many people respect me for it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m cringing at how much external validation I used to seek. Being in computer science is playing the <a href="https://nav.al/long-term">long game</a>. You don’t always get external validation, and good work can take a while.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s easier to “be my own boss” if I were doing research.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe? Ask a researcher this question. But <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/">choosing what to work on is challenging</a>, regardless of whether you’re in research or engineering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I actually really enjoy research more than engineering.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I still feel that I enjoy research more than engineering, but I’ve committed to developing my engineering skills. Again, being in tech is playing the long game, and having good engineering skills will help me no matter where I go, whether it’s research or IC or management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are more clear mentorship opportunities for me.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true if I went to a PhD program, since I’d have access to many professors and older grad student friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can be in a stable career option (5-6 years at least if doing PhD).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This point occasionally gives me anxiety, since I don’t know exactly where I am going to be for the next 5-6 years. Startups are risky. But I’ve gotten more used to this feeling over the past year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Maybe I’m a shitty researcher or will find out that I’m a shitty researcher.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Still a fear of mine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s unclear whether I want to end up in academia or industry research, so a PhD could be for nothing.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One of my math PhD friends explains a PhD as “a socially acceptable reason for screwing around with whatever you’re interested in.” I like this reference, so technically going to a PhD program isn’t a waste if I enjoy it in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Incentives in academia are horrible. There are so many major conferences. How do you balance long term gains with getting the publications out?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is really true. A year ago, I didn’t know how to think long-term. I probably would have tried to maximize my number of papers and burned out in my 3rd year, complaining that I’m not working on anything truly impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A PhD can be really long and hard.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I love Philip Guo’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind"><em>The PhD Grind</em></a>. Unfortunately he recently took his website down, which hosted the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can learn how to build things from scratch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Painfully true — building from scratch is challenging, but the growing pains are necessary to deeply understand productionizing ML. </li>
<li>At the time, I didn’t know about the existence of “real-world” ML and engineering tools such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. These tools are super relevant and learning them can be its own pro.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can see how research is applied in industry and measure the gap between research and industry.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This gap is larger than I expected. It’s also really fun to apply state-of-the-art research to business cases. For example, we recently productionized a transformer model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can gain leadership skills from the beginning and be a key figure in recruiting and defining the culture.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I was thrown into the fire as soon as I joined. Now, a year later, I’ve probably done over a hundred technical interviews, led a few ML projects for key clients, and mentored a couple of interns. I would definitely not have gotten this experience at a larger company.</li>
<li>It’s also cool to be able to choose who you work with (to some extent) by hiring people that fit in with the culture you help to define.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can closely work with both experienced engineers and non-technical domain experts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I have learned so much from every single one of my coworkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I am relatively immune to any level of risk this early in my career.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This honestly just speaks to my insane privileges of graduating from a top school, having experience at big tech companies, and being a US citizen. I am quite thankful for these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Possibly being the only woman, potentially for a long time.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bleh. True. No comment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This is not the route to maximize expected earnings. I could get paid more at a larger company. Only in the small chance that the startup succeeds will I make a lot of money.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>True, but I now feel like this really isn’t a priority for me. Being in tech gives me the privilege of making a high salary wherever I go, and I think that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html">as long as I can live comfortably</a> (as I do now), I’m happy. Maybe this will change if I’m trying to buy a house or have a family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>My technical accomplishments aren’t seen outside the startup.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat false. I think there are some people outside my company who respect my technical abilities.</li>
<li>This point also doesn’t really matter too much, since<a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"> one’s career involves more than just how prolific of a programmer they are.</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I could be overworking myself.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is true of any job. There are always opportunities to work more than you’re expected to. Also, as a new grad, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-mistakes-which-software-engineers-make-in-their-early-years/answer/Edmond-Lau">optimizing for learning rate</a> can feel like overworking oneself, especially in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If I don’t care about the specific application, I might not be motivated to do quality work.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Surprisingly, I don’t care too much about cars (my company’s application), but I am really, really motivated to solve the technical challenges my company faces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My story and decision-making process<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Thinking back to the fall of 2018, I remember how stressed I felt drafting my statement of purpose. I’m the kind of person who’s never fully confident in my decisions — there’s always a nagging <em>what if?</em> in my brain. I didn’t feel a magnetic pull towards academia. I also didn’t feel like I was destined to make a huge impact in industry. What does one pursue if they’re just…unsure? I felt this urge to apply to PhD programs — after all, I grew up in a college town, I’m a professor’s daughter, and most of my closest childhood and university friends are in PhD programs.</p>
<p>One of my older friends told me, “If you know what problem you want to solve, then find the place where you’re most likely to help devise a solution.”  <em>Robustness in machine learning models is something only academics are working on</em>, I naively thought at the time. So maybe a PhD was the right move. But as I drafted my statement of purpose, writing about how we needed to construct and solve relevant toy problems because it would be imperative to have safe and robust machine learning models in the real world, it seemed silly to me that I wanted to research this field when I had never actually worked on machine learning in the real world.  What new perspectives could I bring? Why should a school accept me?</p>
<p>My wonderful undergraduate advisor, <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat Hanrahan</a>, urged me to consider working in industry for a couple years before going to a PhD program. I didn’t like the suggestion at first — what if I would never end up doing a PhD? “Well, then you’ve saved yourself five or six years! If you don’t want to do a PhD, you’ll find out eventually,” he laughed. </p>
<p>Pat had a point, so I started to look for industry machine learning jobs. Fortunately, since I had significant ML research experience for an undergrad, I could pick between many options. Did I want to do machine learning at a large company? Small company? Focus on a specific vertical?  I thought back to my machine learning project at Facebook, where I wrote a few lines of SQL to use a well-oiled tool called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> to set up a gradient boosting classifier. I thought about machine learning at Google, where engineers write <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a> scripts to throw lots of serialized data at one of many models in a zoo.

<p><strong>Die Corona-Warn-App funktioniert nach Recherchen von </strong><strong><em>tagesschau.de</em></strong><strong> auf vielen iPhones nur fehlerhaft. Besitzer werden oft zu spät gewarnt. Die Entwickler räumten das Problem ein - und sehen den Fehler bei Apple. </strong></p>
<p><em>Von Dominik Lauck, tagesschau.de</em></p>
<p> Fünf Wochen nach dem Start der Corona-Warn-App sind Probleme bei der Nutzung bekannt geworden. Nach Recherchen von <em>tagesschau.de</em> funktioniert auf vielen iPhones die Kontaktüberprüfung nur lückenhaft. Nutzerinnen und Nutzer wurden teilweise über Wochen nicht über die App informiert, ob sie Kontakt zu Infizierten hatten oder nicht. SAP, das die App zusammen mit der Deutschen Telekom entwickelt hat, räumte den Fehler ein.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<p> "Da gibt es Probleme, und ich hoffe ganz stark, dass die entweder sehr, sehr schnell beseitigt werden oder wir einen wirksamen Workaround finden, (…) um trotzdem die Funktionalität auf die Beine zu stellen", sagt Thomas Klingbeil, der Software-Architekt der Corona-Warn-App bei SAP gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>.</p>
<h2>Hintergrundaktualisierung wird nicht aufgerufen</h2>
<p> Woran hakt es? Auch wenn die Corona-Warn-App nicht geöffnet ist, soll sie im Hintergrund weiterlaufen und Daten aktualisieren. Wenn es eine Begegnung mit einer Person gab, die dann positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet wurde, soll das Handy den Besitzer eigentlich aktiv mit einer Benachrichtigung auf das erhöhte Risiko hinweisen. "Das Problem, das wir haben, ist, dass die Hintergrundaktualisierung vom Betriebssystem offenbar nicht aufgerufen wird", so Klingbeil.</p><!-- mediaCon-->
<p> Zuvor hatte die "Bild"-Zeitung bereits über ähnliche Probleme bei einigen Android-Geräten berichtet. Dort war die Hintergrundaktualisierung im Stromsparmodus nicht oder nur eingeschränkt möglich. "Das gilt nicht nur für die Corona-Warn-App, sondern für alle Apps auf diesen Smartphones", hieß es dazu aus dem Bundesgesundheitsministerium. Laut Entwickler ist das keine Fehlfunktion in der App, sondern hängt mit den Einstellungen bei den Geräten zusammen. Dies könne von den Nutzern geändert werden.</p>
<p> Das Gesundheitsministerium versicherte, dass die Anwendung "zu jeder Zeit" funktioniert habe. Wer seine Einstellung nicht anpasste, wurde erst beim Öffnen der App vor einem möglichen gefährlichen Kontakt mit einem Corona-Infizierten gewarnt. "Mit der Version 1.1.1, die am Mittwoch erschienen ist, können die Nutzerinnen und Nutzern, diese fehlerhaften Optimierungsfunktionen des Betriebssystems übersteuern", erklärte Jürgen Müller aus dem SAP-Vorstand <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corona-warn-app-und-sie-funktioniert-doch-juergen-mueller">in einem Blogeintrag</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem bei iPhones noch nicht behoben</h2>
<p> Anders als bei den Android-Geräten ist bei den iPhones das Problem noch nicht behoben. Einige Nutzer berichten gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>, dass an mehr als zehn aufeinanderfolgenden Tagen kein Abgleich erfolgte. Das heißt, sie wären im Extremfall erst zehn Tage später gewarnt worden, dass sie Kontakt mit Infizierten gehabt hatten.</p>
<p> Normalerweise werden die Daten in der App alle 24 Stunden aktualisiert. Wann genau steht unter dem Punkt "Risikoermittlung" beziehungsweise in den Einstellungen des Smartphones. Pro Tag sollen bis zu 14 Datensätze abgerufen werden - einen für jeden der zurückliegenden 14 Tage. "Wenn die App in den letzten zwei Wochen dauerhaft aktiv war, sollten Sie in der Regel 13 oder 14 Überprüfungen in den letzten 24 Stunden sehen", erklären die Entwickler. Die Zahl der abgerufenen Datensätze sagt nichts darüber aus, ob oder wieviele Kontakte die App mit anderen Corona-Warn-Apps ermittelt hat.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Fehler liegt im Betriebssystem von Apple</h2>
<p> Die Entwickler haben Apple über die Lücken bei der Kontaktüberprüfung informiert, der iPhone-Hersteller habe den Fehler mittlerweile eingeräumt. Nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen befindet sich im Betriebssystem iOS ein Bug. Dort ist ein sogenannter Scheduler einprogrammiert, der dafür sorgt, dass die Corona-Warn-App im Hintergrund die Daten einmal täglich vom Server holt.</p>
<p> "Wir sind vollkommen auf ein regelmäßiges Funktionieren des Schedulers angewiesen", erklärt Peter Lorenz, Chefentwickler der Deutschen Telekom, gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>. "Dieser Scheduler hat hin und wieder einen Schluckauf." Dadurch unterbleibe der Impuls, die Daten vom Server abzurufen.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Ministerium räumt Fehler ein</h2>
<p> Das Problem haben die Entwickler nach eigenen Aussagen "vor einer Woche" bemerkt. Auch in der Schweiz, Österreich und Italien hätten die Programmierer der dortigen Corona-Apps entsprechende Probleme festgestellt. "Uns war nicht bekannt, in welcher Breite das Problem auftritt", so Lorenz.</p>
<p> Das Ausmaß sei erst an diesem Freitag erkannt worden, als sich die Entwickler nach den Berichten über die Android-Fehler auch das Apple-Betriebssystem genauer angeschaut hätten. "Die Entwickler arbeiten mit Hochdruck an einem Weg, die systembedingten Einschränkungen zu umgehen, bis Apple das Systemproblem selbst gelöst hat", erklärte das Gesundheitsministerium auf Anfrage. SAP-Sprecher Hilmar Schepp zeigte sich zuversichtlich, "bis Anfang der kommenden Woche" eine vorübergehende Lösung zu haben, den Bug zu umgehen.</p>
<h2>Codes werden weiterhin ausgetauscht</h2>
<p> Sowohl bei den Android- als auch bei den Apple-Smartphones würden jedoch auch ohne die Hintergrundaktualisierung anonyme Codes mit anderen Smartphones ausgetauscht, versichern die Entwickler. Allerdings wird ein Nutzer bei fehlender Hintergrundaktualisierung nur dann über ein Ansteckungsrisiko informiert, wenn er die App öffnet.</p>
<p> Wie viele Geräte von den Problemen betroffen sind, ist nicht bekannt. Insgesamt wurde die App in Deutschland bereits 16,2 Millionen Mal heruntergeladen. Noch am Nachmittag hatte das Gesundheitsministerium erklärt, das Problem mit der aussetzenden Hintergrundaktualisierung sei bei iPhones nicht aufgetreten. "Im Moment können wir sagen, dass es nicht alle Androidgeräte betroffen hat, sondern nur bestimmte", sagte eine Sprecherin.</p><div>

<h4>So können Sie die Kontaktüberprüfung abrufen</h4>
<div><p>In den Einstellungen Ihres Smartphones können Sie sehen, ob die Kontaktüberprüfung der Corona-Warn-App reibungslos funktioniert oder Lücken aufweist. Dazu sind folgende Schritte nötig:</p><p><strong>iPhone:</strong> <br>Einstellungen -&gt; Datenschutz -&gt; Health -&gt; COVID-19-Kontaktprotokoll -&gt; Kontaktüberprüfungen </p><p><strong>Android-Geräte: </strong><br>Einstellungen -&gt; Google -&gt; COVID-19-Benachrichtigungen an</p></div>

</div><!-- teaser -->
</div>

<h2>App soll Infektionsketten unterbrechen</h2>
<p> Die Corona-Warn-App wurde <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/corona-warn-app-startet-101.html">am 16. Juni veröffentlicht</a> und ist in den Stores <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rki.coronawarnapp">von Google</a> und <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/corona-warn-app/id1512595757">Apple</a> erhältlich. Sie soll helfen, Infektionsketten nachzuverfolgen und zu unterbrechen. Außerdem kann sie dazu beitragen, dass Menschen nach einem Coronavirus-Test möglichst schnell ihr Testergebnis digital erhalten und über die App anonym mögliche Kontaktpersonen warnen können, wenn diese auch die App installiert haben.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259084270854905856">link</a> after <a href="https://www.longevity.vc/">link</a> after <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15174-3">link</a> after <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/researchers-able-to-improve-reverse-age-related-diseases-in-mice/">link</a> on the topic.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Six years ago, a lifetime in the aging field, the mere suggestion that aging could be reversed was enough to have your colleagues &amp; donors screw up their noses. Tom Rando <a href="https://twitter.com/StanfordMed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StanfordMed</a> deserves a shout out for being brave enough back then to use the word "reversal" openly 6/n</p>— David Sinclair, PhD (@davidasinclair) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259912936602177536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We ❤️ &nbsp; Old Underwear...</strong></p>
<p>They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains 🤢</p>
<p><strong>X11 is like Old Underwear.</strong> It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it in spite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/PinePhone"><strong>PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.</strong></a></p>
<p>It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with <strong>Wayland.</strong></p>
<p>But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png" alt="X11 Service on Pinebook Pro"></p>
<p>That's the X11 Service... A <strong>2.2 MB</strong> executable named <strong><code>Xorg</code></strong>. </p>
<p>The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png" alt="X11 Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"><strong>Window Manager / Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the <strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and <strong>"decorates"</strong> them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a <strong>Screen Buffer</strong> according to their screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>keyboard and mouse input</strong> is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?</em></p>
<p>Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.</p>
<p>Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC Systems Research Group</a> way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png" alt="Distributed X11 System"></p>
<p>Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...</p>

<p><em>Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p>No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!</p>
<p>PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors"><strong>Wayland Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png" alt="Wayland Compositor on PinePhone"></p>
<p>That's the Wayland Compositor... A <strong>262 KB</strong> executable named <code>unity-system-compositor</code>. </p>
<p><em>Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!</em></p>
<p>Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...</p>

<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)">"EGL API"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the apps running on our phone: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.</p>
<p>When then app starts, it queries the <strong>Wayland Compositor</strong> for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket">Linux socket file</a>: <code>/run/user/32011/wayland-0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayland Compositor returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)"><strong>EGL Interface</strong></a> to the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App calls the EGL Interface to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL"><strong>render OpenGL graphics</strong></a> directly to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux Display Driver forwards the OpenGL rendering commands to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"><strong>GPU to update the screen</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>touchscreen input</strong> is captured by the Wayland Compositor, and forwarded to the active app.</p>

</ol>
<p>Wayland looks so much simpler and faster than X11!</p>
<p><em>Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?</em></p>
<p>Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!</p>
<p>Wayland was first released in 2008 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">11 years ago</a>)... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. (<a href="https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY">And websites too</a>)</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-egl.jpg" alt="Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone"></p>
<p><em>Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone</em></p>

<p>Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red
        1.0,  //  Green
        0.0,  //  Blue
        1.0   //  Alpha
    );
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>render_display()</code> looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)</p>
<p>Two things to note...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES"><strong>OpenGL for Embedded Systems</strong></a> Version 2.0.</p>
<p>OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. It's used by many mobile and console games today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the <strong>OpenGL ES Context</strong> and <strong>Window Surface</strong> from Wayland</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before calling <code>render_display()</code>, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Dimensions of the OpenGL region to be rendered
static int WIDTH  = 480;
static int HEIGHT = 360;

static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

//  Create the EGL Window and render OpenGL graphics
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
</code></pre>
<p>Functions named <code>wl_egl_...</code> are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named <code>egl...</code> come from the cross-platform <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:%7E:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.">Mesa 3D Graphics Library</a>.</p>
<p><em>EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?</em></p>
<p>In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. </p>
<p>Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.</p>
<p>Thus in the code above, we take a Wayland Surface <code>surface</code> and transform it into an EGL Window <code>egl_window</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface <code>egl_surface</code> from that EGL Window...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
    egl_window, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>And we begin the OpenGL rendering...</p>
<pre><code>//  Set the current rendering surface
eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
    egl_surface, egl_context);

//  Render the display
render_display();

//  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how we create a Wayland Region for OpenGL rendering: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

//  Create the Wayland Region for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    //  Create a Wayland Region
    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    //  Set the dimensions of the Wayland Region
    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

    //  Add the Region to the Wayland Surface
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about EGL, check out <a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/Wayland/EGL/">"Programming Wayland Clients"</a></p>
<p>The Wayland EGL code in this article was adapted from that document.</p>

<p>Earlier in <code>create_window()</code> we called an <strong>EGL Context</strong> <code>egl_context</code> to render OpenGL graphics.</p>
<p>Here's how we get the EGL Context: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L113-L165"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Wayland EGL Interfaces for OpenGL Rendering
static EGLDisplay egl_display;  //  EGL Display
static EGLConfig  egl_conf;     //  EGL Configuration
static EGLContext egl_context;  //  EGL Context

//  Create the EGL Context for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void init_egl(void) {
    //  Attributes for our EGL Display
    EGLint config_attribs[] = {
        EGL_SURFACE_TYPE,    EGL_WINDOW_BIT,
        EGL_RED_SIZE,        8,

        <h3>
About</h3>

<p>
Mathematical Components is the name of a library of formalized mathematics for
the Coq system. It covers a variety of topics, from the theory of basic data
structures (e.g., numbers, lists, finite sets) to advanced results in various
flavors of algebra. This library constitutes the infrastructure for the machine
checked proofs of the Four Color Theorem and of the Odd Order Theorem.
</p>
<p>
The reason of existence of this book is to break down the barriers to entry.
While there are several books around covering the usage of the Coq system and
the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components library is built in an
unconventional way. As a consequence this book provides a non standard
presentation of Coq, putting upfront the formalization choices and the proof
style that are the pillars of the library.
</p>
<p>
This books targets two classes of public. On one hand newcomers, even the more
mathematical inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the programming
language of Coq, <em>Gallina</em>, and the <em>Ssreflect</em> proof language.
On the other hand accustomed Coq users find a substantial account of the
formalization style that made the Mathematical Components library possible.

<p>
	*** The Urban Archeology Program uncovered basalt slab floors corresponding to an open plaza in the Old Houses of Axayácatl, <em>tlatoani</em> of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	*** INAH’s archaeological salvage project also detected the remains of the conqueror's dwelling, which later became the headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

 

<p>
	Within the walls of the Old Houses of Axayácatl some of the most decisive episodes of the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán occurred, such as the death of the <em>tlatoani</em> Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, possibly on June 29, 1520; unexpected outcomes that undermined the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards and triggered the open confrontation.</p>

<p>
	The most recent discovery made by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), of vestiges of that pre-Hispanic palace, and of the remains of a later house built under the orders of Hernán Cortés, with reused materials from the previous Tenochca building, revives the memory of those historical events, five centuries later.</p>

<p>
	Thanks to historical sources, it is no mystery for archaeologists that under the floors of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, one of the most emblematic buildings of Mexico City’s Historic Center, located next to the Metropolitan Cathedral, are the foundations of the Palace of Axayácatl, which functioned as the living quarters of Cortés' entourage upon their arrival in the heart of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>
	Over the last two decades, and taking advantage of diverse remodeling projects undertaken in the headquarters of that institution, various INAH experts have found remnants of the former residence of Moctezuma II's father. The most recent discoveries were brought to light during archaeological interventions led by Raúl Barrera Rodríguez and José María García Guerrero, head and collaborator, respectively, of the Urban Archeology Program (PAU).</p>

<p>
	Following an inspection for refurbishments conducted in the northern half of the historic building, PAU personnel carried out an archaeological salvage project between the first days of September 2017 and mid-August 2018, focusing on the main courtyard and an adjacent room. It is noteworthy that the project continues to the present in the post-dig research phase.</p>

<p>
	Excavations resulted in the discovery of numerous basalt slab floors, which must have formed part of an open plaza in the Palace of Axayácatl, the ruler who controlled the destiny of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	Also, from the early Viceregal period (1521-1620 AD), the remains of a house built by order of Cortés were uncovered. That construction, where the Spanish conqueror resided for several years, would also become the seat of the first Cabildo of New Spain (around 1525) and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, granted to the conqueror four years later.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The archaeological investigation</strong></p>

<p>
	As an exciting part of the public outreach program "Contigo en la Distancia” (“With you from a Distance”), from the Ministry of Culture, the head of the PAU, Raúl Barrera, and his collaborator José María García, explain that they dug 12 test pits - 2 meters per side and 1.50 m deep— around the main courtyard of the National Monte de Piedad, where remodeling work was being carried out to reinforce the columns that define the structure and support the first level of the building.</p>

<p>
	By excavating a series of test pits, on the north, east and west sides, the remains of a stone masonry wall - 1.50 meters high by 1.25 m wide - were uncovered. This wall served as a foundation and basal platform for a series of columns of the building erected around 1755, which allows us to deduce that the central courtyard was originally larger. Also, in the west section of this same space were found the subflooring: basal portions and a shaft of other columns from the early Viceregal period.</p>

<p>
	However, major surprises awaited in the adjacent room. PAU archaeologists had the opportunity to conduct an extensive excavation, which allowed them to locate the remains of a room made of basalt and <em>tezontle </em>(vesicular lava) dressed stones - 5 by 4 meters -, whose base sat upon a floor of basalt slabs. Further analyses led to the conclusion that this was the home of Hernán Cortés, once Mexico-Tenochtitlan fell in 1521.</p>

<p>
	Below the subflooring of the house of Cortés, more than 3 meters deep, the remains of another floor of basalt slabs, but from pre-Hispanic times, were detected. Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayácatl, probably a courtyard.</p>

<p>
	Barrera and García emphasize that the vestiges of the nascent Viceregal era correspond to reused materials from the Old Houses of Axayácatl. These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations.</p>

<p>
	As an example of this, embedded in the façade of the southeast interior corner of the colonial room, two pre-Hispanic dressed stones carved with sculptures in high relief were found. They depicted a feathered serpent (Quetzalcóatl) and a headdress of feathers, and must have belonged to a panel of the Palace of Axayácatl. Also, another Mexica sculpture with the glyph that symbolizes the <em>tianquiztli</em> or market was recovered, in its place as part of a shaft.</p>

<p>
	Some of the diagnostic materials, which allow the preliminary dating of these findings, are the remains of pre-Hispanic and colonial pottery, whose types (styles) belong to the aforementioned historical periods: Aztec III: Orange Monochrome, Black-on-Orange and Texcoco Burnished Earthenware; as well as glazed earthenware and Spanish and New Spain majolica.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Old Houses of Axayácatl</strong></p>

<p>
	Raúl Barrera, also a researcher at the INAH Directorate of Salvage Archaeology, reflects on the fact that some material evidence speaks volumes, by its very paucity. Such is the case for the recent discoveries in the National Monte de Piedad, which “speak” of the destruction that the main buildings of Tenochtitlan were subjected to, both for symbolic and practical purposes.</p>

<p>
	Despite the modest nature of the remains, those pre-Hispanic floors were the same ones that the Spanish invaders and their allies tread upon during their arrival to Tenochtitlan, on November 8, 1519. Moctezuma II allowed them to stay in the old houses that had belonged to his father, and soon after they turned them into their barracks.</p>

<p>
	While in that palace, numerous events took place. For example, they remodeled a room to celebrate mass, and right there, they also held various rulers captive, starting with their distinguished host: Moctezuma Xocoyotzin; as well as Cuitláhuac, lord of Iztapalapa; Cacamatzin,<em> tlatoani</em> of Texcoco; and Itzcuauhtzin, lord of Tlatelolco, among others.</p>

<p>
	Following on the massacre during the festival of Tóxcatl that took place at the Templo Mayor (“Great Temple”) on May 22 of 1520, by the order of Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish withdrew and returned to the Palace of Axayácatl. That incident unleashed the anger of the Mexica and, at the end of June of that year, they besieged the invaders in that building. Hernán Cortés wanted to contain their fury through Moctezuma, who tried to placate them from the roof of the palace. But the efforts were in vain, as his brother Cuitláhuac had already been ordained the new ruler.</p>

<p>
	On the night of June 30, 1520, the Spanish fled to Tlaxcala by the great causeway of Tlacopan (today Tacuba), leaving behind the Old Houses of Axayácatl.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cortés’ houses</strong></p>

<p>
	After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the surviving Mexicas were forced to destroy, with their own hands, their temples and palaces and build the new city using the same materials. The Old Houses of Axayácatl would gave way to the Houses of Hernán de Cortés, which were also the temporary headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain, around 1525, and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, a noble title carrying the responsibility for creating a government, granted in 1529 for his services to the Spanish Crown.</p>

<p>
	Upon the conqueror's death in 1547, his descendants retained ownership. His son Martín Cortés Zúñiga inherited the marquessate, but in 1566 he was involved in a conspiracy that sought to seize the government of New Spain, so he was expelled from the Viceroyalty. The houses and the extensive land remained in the hands of a legal representative and, already in poor condition, were sold to the Sacro Monte de Piedad in 1836.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      

<div>
  
    
      <div><p>In version 3.4, python shipped with a new module in the standard library,  <code>pathlib</code> . At the time of its release, I remember hearing some fanfare around it, but I didn’t quite understand the point of it. I had only recently stopped adding strings together to create paths to the files and folders I needed to work with, in favor of using the  <code>os</code>  and  <code>os.path</code>  modules. It took me a little while to experiment with it and plumb the documentation for useful&nbsp;bits.</p><p>Since then, I’ve learned a lot about the  <code>pathlib</code>  module, and as I have said before, <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/pathlib-my-new-favorite-module/">it is my favorite module in the standard library</a>.</p><p>While that’s the case, most people I talk to about it are working to hard to access files and folders with python. Many have either not heard about it, or they still don’t understand&nbsp;it.</p><p>They still write code like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p><span>OK</span>, so there’s nothing wrong with that code per se, but most pythonistas would agree that your code should be readable. I would argue that  <code>pathlib</code>  could make that line of code more readable<label for="readable"></label><span>One could argue that it’s not necessarily more readable, if you’re not as familiar with it. So maybe I should settle for it being shorter?</span>&nbsp;:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>I don’t know what your favorite module is in the standard library<label for="std"></label><span>Though, I would like to know what it is and why!</span> , but I imagine that most people don’t really think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>The reason why  <code>pathlib</code>  is my favorite module is that I have found it to be so very useful. And I really believe it can save you pain and effort in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>That’s why I created two resources for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The first is what I’m calling a “field guide” to  <code>pathlib</code> . It’s a standalone document, a little longer than one of my blog posts, that will introduce you to the module and some of its features I use the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I have also created a cheat sheet for the module, since there are over 40 useful properties and methods on a  <code>Path</code>  object, and I find that I could use a quick-reference guide to remind me of the ones I don’t use as&nbsp;often.</p><p>Look, I suggest the next time you are going to work with a file or folder, give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p>It combines parts of the  <code>os</code> ,  <code>os.path</code> , and  <code>glob</code>  modules (and maybe more) in one useful&nbsp;package.</p></div>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="strings-arent-good-enough">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#strings-arent-good-enough">Strings aren’t good enough</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>One of the things I love about  <code>pathlib</code>  is that you are now working with an object instead of a&nbsp;string.</p><p>Strings are not the best way to work with data. You can’t ask a string what the name of the file is. Instead, you’ll have to come up with method to break the string apart and harvest that&nbsp;information.</p><p>One way to do that would be to use the  <code>basename</code>  method in the  <code>os.path</code>  module and split the&nbsp;result:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = '/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html'
file_name = os.path.basename(location).split('.')[0]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>That works, but it’s not the most readable. You have to do some mental gymnastics to unpack the four different things that happen in that one line of code. It could be challenging for people who are new to&nbsp;python.</p><p>Instead, you could use a  <code>Path</code>  object:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = Path('/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html')
file_name = location.stem</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Now, this is what I’m talking about! There’s no mental gymnastics to figure out how to split strings. There’s no having to remember what individual  <code>os.path</code>  methods do. It’s just simply asking an object what one of its properties&nbsp;are.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="express-yourself">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#express-yourself">Express yourself</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Since it frees me from directly manipulating strings, I find that  <code>pathlib</code>  allows me to be more expressive with the way I write code that interacts with files and&nbsp;folders.</p><p>I write less code, and my mind feels more able to think about the problem at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>For instance, you can easily reference all of the  <code>json</code>  files in the current&nbsp;folder:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>You can even safely open a file, load its contents, and close it in one&nbsp;line:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')
for f in json_files:
    data = json.loads(f.read_text())</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>Even manipulating paths are easier with&nbsp;pathlib.</p><p>I see many people joining paths by adding strings together, like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># not the best way to manipulate a path
root_folder = 'path/to/content/folder'
config_file = root_folder + 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this can work, it’s not the best way to manipulate paths, as this way will break if you ever run your code on a different operating system, as Windows uses back-slashes to denote paths. All other platforms use&nbsp;slashes.</p><p>Also, it’s easy to introduce bugs like I did in that code. I didn’t include a trailing slash in the  <code>root_folder</code>  variable. So the resulting path would look like this, and would probably&nbsp;fail:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># result of previous code
'path/to/content/folderconfig/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>The next best way to join paths is to use the  <code>os.path.joinpath</code>  method. This will handle the “bug” I introduced&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = os.path.join(root_folder, 'config/config.json')
print(config_file)
'path/to/content/folder/config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this is better, it still doesn’t address the cross-platform&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Thankfully,  <code>pathlib</code>  not only makes it even easier to join paths, but it also allow you to write code that works on every operating&nbsp;system.</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">root_folder = Path('path/to/content/folder')
config_file = root_folder.joinpath('config/config.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Additionally,  <code>pathlib</code>  gives you the option to write less code when joining paths. This is equivalent to the line&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = root_folder / 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <h2 id="its-your-turn">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#its-your-turn">It’s your turn</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Look, you seriously should give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p><a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/resources/">Download my field guide</a>. Use it to get a basic understanding of how to use the  <code>Path</code>  object. Practice accessing files with it. Then, come back and download my cheat sheet, so you can better remember what attributes are at your disposal and be reminded of the ones you haven’t tried&nbsp;yet.</p><p>I’m confident you’ll enjoy working with files and folders more than you do&nbsp;now.</p><p>And also, let me know how you would improve these&nbsp;resources.</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you!</p></div>

<![CDATA[Bloom filters debunked: Dispelling 30 Years of bad math with Coq]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org5efdc67">
<p>
There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as
<b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>) where the browser will automatically warn the
user if they happen to navigate to a "<i>malicious</i>" URL:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png" alt="malicious-site.png">
</p> 


<p>
While <i>conceptually</i> simple, this feature actually requires more
engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the
set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be
somewhat difficult.
</p>

<p>
This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of <i>all</i>
known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain <i>millions and
millions</i> of entries, is something that is just practically
infeasible for most users. </p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png" alt="database_local.png"> </p>


<p>
Conversely, sending <i>every</i> URL that a user visits to some external
service, where it could be <i>logged</i> and <i>data-mined</i> by nefarious
third parties, is something that most users should
probably not be comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by
means of a rather interesting <i>compromise</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Using a probabilistic data structure known as a <b>Bloom filter</b>,
Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known
malicious URLs locally.  By querying this <i>space-efficient</i> local set,
browsers will only send up a <i>small proportion</i> of the honest URLs.
</p>

<p><b><i>Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database</i>.</b>
</p>


<p>
This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of
users ever day, depends on <b>two key properties</b> of Bloom filters:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>No false negatives</dt><dd>This states that if a query for an URL in the
Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be
guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e
<i>the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for
all known malicious URLs</i>.</dd>

<dt>Low false positive rate</dt><dd>This property states that for any URL
that is <i>not in the set of malicious</i> URLs, the likelihood of a
Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be <i>fairly
low</i> - thus minimising the number of <i>unnecessary</i> infractions on
user privacy.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
This mechanism works <i>quite</i> well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter
seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has
one small problem, and that is:
</p>

<p><b><i>The</i> widely cited expression <i>for the</i> false positive rate <i>of a bloom filter is</i> wrong!</b>
</p>


<p>
In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have
actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention,
requiring <i>multiple</i> corrections and even <i>corrections of these
corrections</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our
understanding of a Bloom filter at all?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, <i>never fear</i>, I am writing this post to inform you that we have
just recently used <code>Coq</code> to produce the <i>very first</i> <b>certified</b> proof
of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to
this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) to a
mechanism that countless people rely on <i>every single</i> day.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this
research, answering the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Bloom filter?</li>
<li>Why did these errors initially arise?</li>
<li>What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?</li>
</ul>

This research was just recently presented at CAV2020 under the title
"Certifying Certainty and Uncertainty in Approximate Membership Query
Structures", you can find the paper <a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/certifying-certainty-and-uncertainty-in-approximate-membership-q/18186934">here</a>, and a video presentation of
it <a href="https://invidio.us/D80VCsVeCMs?t=4482">here</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>If your an engineer you probably spend a lot of time using a terminal.
Some of your best productivity gains will come from understanding it better and making small improvements to repetitive tasks.</p><p>Many people know the basics for default shell shortcuts like Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e to go to the begining and end of a line.
There are also a few keyboard shortcuts you’ve probably found by accident like Ctrl+s, Ctrl+z, or Ctrl+c.</p><p>Here are some keyboard shortcuts I use regularly that you might find helpful too.
I’m focusing on zsh because that’s my preferred interactive shell but many of these shortcuts will work in bash or other shells too.</p><p>If you want more shell tips, check out my mastering zsh workshop <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh">https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh</a>.</p><p>We’ll start with some basic keyboard shortcuts and get progressivly more advanced.
Many of these shortcuts are default behavior but some will need code added to your configuration to enable them.</p><h3 id="basics">Basics</h3><p>I’m amazed how long it took me to learn these keybord shortcuts and see that people still don’t know them.</p><p><code>Ctrl+r</code>: Reverse search through your command history.
Kinda like pushing the up arrow with search.</p><p><code>Ctrl+c</code>: kill/interupt the current running process.
If you don’t want it to print <code>^C</code> every time you press it you can add <code>set echo-control-characters Off</code> to your <code>~/.inputrc</code> file.</p><p><code>Ctrl+d</code>: Close your current terminal.
Same as typing <code>exit</code> but way shorter.</p><p><code>Ctrl+l</code>: clear the screen.
Similar, but slightly different, to typing <code>clear</code>.</p><p><code>Ctrl+z</code>: Suspend process.
This is really helpful if you’re in your editor and you need to run a command real quick.
Instead of opening a new terminal press <code>ctrl+z</code>, run your command, and then type <code>fg</code> to bring the command back to the foreground.</p><h3 id="delete-word-behind-your-cursor">Delete word behind your cursor</h3><p>If you have a command typed out or selected from your history with Ctrl+r you probably want to change one or two words from it.</p><p>First you can move your cursor back a word with <code>Alt+b</code>.
Press it multiple times to keep moving back.</p><p>Once your cursor is at the end of the word you need to change/delete press <code>Ctrl+w</code> to delete it.
If it doesn’t delete up to the characters you expect try setting your <code>$WORDCHARS</code> variable to characters that should be considered part of the word.</p><h3 id="don-t-repeat-your-whole-arguments">Don’t repeat your whole arguments</h3><p>If you need to move a file to something like a $FILE.bak you can do that easily with <code>{,}</code>.</p><p>Don’t do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt.bak
</code></pre><p>Do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt{,.bak}
</code></pre><p>It works anywhere in the command too!
This will copy name.txt into new-folder (assuming it exists).</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/{my-long-file,new-folder}/name.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="enter-last-argument-from-previous-command-s">Enter last argument from previous command(s)</h3><p>There is a default shell variable <code>$?</code> which represents the last argument from the preceeding command (e.g. <code>echo $?</code>)
<code>Ctrl+.</code> is the keyboard shortcut to do the same thing.
Not only is it easier to type but you can push it multiple times to cycle through the last argument from previous commands.</p><h3 id="prepend-sudo">Prepend sudo</h3><p>I need this a lot.
You type out a command or find it from your history and need to run it with sudo but forgot it at the begining of the line.
Normally you would <code>Ctrl+a</code> type <code>sudo</code> then <code>Ctrl+e</code>.
This shortcuts does all that with a single shortcut.</p><p>Add this code snippet to your .zshrc
I prefer <code>esc, s</code> for the keyboard shortcut because it works well in vim mode and doesn’t clobber the default <code>Ctrl+s</code> shortcut.</p><pre><code># add sudo before command with esc, s
function prepend-sudo() {
  [[ -z $BUFFER ]] &amp;&amp; zle up-history
  if [[ $BUFFER == sudo\ * ]]; then
    LBUFFER="${LBUFFER#sudo }"
  else
    LBUFFER="sudo $LBUFFER"
  fi
}
zle -N prepend-sudo
# shortcut keys: [Esc] [s]
bindkey "\es" prepend-sudo
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/prepend-sudo.gif" alt=""></p><p>If you’re using oh-my-zsh you can add the <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/sudo/sudo.plugin.zsh#L32">sudo plugin</a> and the default key binding is <code>esc, esc</code>.</p><h3 id="open-command-in-editor">Open command in $EDITOR</h3><p>There is a really handy command <code>fc</code> which will open your last command in your $EDITOR.
It’s great for long or multi-line command edits.</p><p>There are lots of other ways to accomplish editing the last command you can check out <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/blob/master/docs/config/history.md#modifying-the-last-command">here</a>.</p><p>To edit your current command in your editor add this snippet to your .zshrc</p><pre><code>autoload -U edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
# shortcut key: [Esc] [v]

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><h2 id="d4ba">Project Management</h2><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://blog.maddevs.io/@tamaramun?source=post_page-----a850df35b3----------------------" rel="noopener"><div><p><img alt="Tamara Mun" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*kYv_s7Yqw5w34iwqYxKzww.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></p></div></a></div></div></div></div></div><p id="e40e">We continue to share our experience in project management. In the previous article, we shared advice on how to lead your project to fail, today we will talk about how to ruin a relationship with a customer.</p><p id="cfd7">Most of the IT projects imply constant cooperation between the team members and customers. Although it might be often overlooked, the role and the importance of the client within the project is very crucial. Thus, it is in your interest to build a strong relationship based on trust. However, gaining trust on a single occasion is not a dealmaker — you have to maintain and reinforce it by every action.</p><p id="931c">As a project manager at <a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=ruin-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mad Devs</a>, I have worked with quite many clients and gained first-hand experience and knowledge on how to elevate trustful partnerships. Here are my <strong>5 wake-up calls, </strong>which indicate that you are on the verge of losing credibility and setting doubts on your expertise to clients.</p><ol><li id="5fc9"><strong>Lacking transparency</strong></li></ol><p id="c403">We often talk about the great importance of transparency for businesses in a modern-day world. Even though companies implement the latest software to achieve the required level of transparency in the documentation and on organizational levels, there are still easy to eliminate yet often overlooked aspects such as transparent communication.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Lacking transparency." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3" width="1000" height="643" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="426d">Nowadays, the ability to collaborate with people from around the globe is more feasible than ever before. As globalization brings us closer to each other, we have to remember that everybody comes from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Such cases are commonly found in slack group channels when someone starts speaking in the language that not every member of the group understands as a native speaker. Yes, maybe the majority do understand it, but the person who did not is going to feel left out and neglected.</p><p id="c8bd">I would suggest implementing a one language policy not only for video calls with the client but also for every group chat where he/she participates.<strong> Of course, it is not only about the language barrier but the overall feeling of inclusivity. </strong>It also would be better to avoid any inside jokes and topics that a person might not be familiar with.</p><p id="73dc"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Broken promises</strong></p><p id="14a4">Have you scheduled a deadline for fixing a bug with your front-end engineer, but he asks for an extension? Sounds familiar, right? I can’t even count how many times such irresponsible actions were putting me into a risky position with a client and upsetting the whole team. Because for a team to operate as a single entity, everyone should be self-organized and committed to common goals. The well-structured team is key to an outstanding final product, which will leave the client satisfied with the result and a feeling of a civil partnership. And as the word of mouth rules, good reviews can bring more customers to your services.</p><p id="6a88">I believe it is essential to create an environment where achievements and success can be regularly tracked and celebrated because it helps team members to stay focused and keep track of their responsibilities and tasks. For example, we at <a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=how-ruin-relationship-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mad Devs</a> have been implementing the OKR approach (Objectives and Key Results). And I am already seeing the positive impact it brings to the teams because it provides each member with a clear vision of the goals. Clear goals make it easier for them to contribute and allocate their time efficiently.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Broken promises." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF" width="1000" height="626" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="4780"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Poor reporting</strong></p><p id="e23a">Reporting might be a point of frustration for companies in the early development stages or teams that don’t have a clear organizational structure. For example, you have signed off the project with the client and carefully planned it. Then you are proceeding to the execution stage. Your engineering team is working hard on developing the product, but at the same time, the client is continuously asking questions about the progress made. And don’t get me wrong, an interested, and involved client is an excellent thing! Yet clients repeatedly asking questions about development may be evidence of a poor reporting process in the team. <strong>The team should proactively share what’s going on in the project to keep everyone up-to-date.</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Poor reporting." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2059">Nowadays, the client’s involvement in the project is higher than ever before. The client participates at almost every stage of the project. Therefore, it is vital to set the right plan for further interaction and give the client easy access to check the team’s progress. Moreover, modern-day solutions make it way easier to accomplish this goal by using project management apps such as JIRA, Trello, Basecamp, etc. You can create a very sophisticated and easy-to-comprehend schedule where all the deadlines and set goals can be tracked and updated while also giving customers more tools and room to be involved and supervise the project.</p><p id="c35f"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Discrediting the team</strong></p><p id="adf8">This point will probably better resonate with a project manager. Imagine a situation where the deadline is approaching you, but the QA team found new bugs that are delaying the release. And now, you have to explain your struggle to the client. This conversation is not going to be one of the most relaxed, but you have to remain calm and clear-minded, no matter what. Otherwise, it is easy to fall in the pitfall of assigning the blame to other team members and shedding the wrong light. You have to remember that any problems that may arise will be faced by the team together, and there can’t be any scapegoats. If something is falling apart, it indicates poor time management or a lack of planning and testing.</p><p id="2909">Aside from the previous example, it is essential to remember that disclosing any problems you have within the team with the client is probably not the best solution. If you have any complaints about a specific member, this feedback should be discussed directly with the recipient and in privacy.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Discrediting the team." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI" width="1000" height="639" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="db4e"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Ignoring clients’ needs</strong></p><p id="8aa4">Often some ideas of how the final product should look like are diverging between developers and clients. And, understandably, engineers are getting very committed to it throughout the project and trying to improve it in every possible way. Yet being absentmindedly carried away by such ideas can negatively result in your relationship with the customer. If the feature you are trying to implement is not on his/her priority list and you are spending a significant amount of time working on it, <em>(while the more appropriate stack of work is being pushed to the side</em>), you might end up not meeting the main goal and therefore not fulfilling clients’ wishes.</p><p id="9662">Even though such enthusiasm from team members is well appreciated, any modifications that are wished to be made should be negotiated and approved by the customer to prevent future misunderstandings.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Ignoring clients’ needs." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r" width="400" height="257" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r 400w" sizes="400px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="8f87"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p id="7c4d">Of course, these wake-up calls don’t cover every possible issue. However, I believe that these small miscommunications can be fixed without any pain and increase your credibility in the customers’ eyes. I hope this article will help you be more attentive to your actions, and no client/team relationship is going to be further harmed by any of the points I mentioned above.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3164/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png" width="1582" height="860" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="9888">Feel free to leave any comments or any other useful tips you have concerning this subject.

Functional Programming has been around for much longer than OOP as it dates back to the 60s.</p><p id="871c">Functional Programming is a paradigm. It follows the declarative pattern, which means, it focuses on what the program wants to achieve without indicating how. Particularly, JavaScript cannot be compared with functional languages like Haskell, Erlang, Elm, etc., but it supports the functional paradigm very well. Being engaged in functional programming, we design the application architecture and write code using only functions. Functional Programming is excellent for data processing, concurrent, high critical, and serverless systems.</p><p id="7406">In this article, we will consider the following concepts of Functional Programming in JavaScript with simple code examples:</p><ul><li id="d23f">Pure functions;</li><li id="32b5">Immutability;</li><li id="bb01">Referential Transparency;</li><li id="2836">First-class functions;</li><li id="2e78">Higher-order functions.</li></ul><ul><li id="a6ca">Readable;</li><li id="56e3">Concise;</li><li id="4dd1">Testable;</li><li id="af97">Enables Concurrency;</li><li id="ef3d">Robust.</li></ul><p id="6bfb">In Functional Programming, small modules can be coded quickly and easily. It is one of the main advantages of this paradigm. Besides, Functional Programming is a lot more concise than OOP. It tends to enforce the writing of the code in order of operations, which is more logical. Functional Programming has better predictability with pure functions than with impure ones. Pure functions in functional programming are predictable because the only thing they depend on is their input, and the only thing they do is return their output. This means it’s safer, and it’s harder to introduce bugs in your code. Also, it means that it’s easier to test code and find bugs if they occur.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Photo by chuttersnap on Unsplash." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chuttersnap?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chuttersnap</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="d133">The pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments. It does not look at anything else from the outside scope. It only returns its output. It does not have any other effect on the world. Pure functions do not make any other changes than returning their return value.</p><p id="8853">There is a notion in Functional Programming called side-effects. A side-effect is when a function not only returns a value but also goes off and changes something on the side. When a function runs, it could change something while it’s running. You have to avoid side effects as much as possible. Sometimes you need side effects.</p><p id="b49f">Always try to minimize the scope of every variable that you make. It means that every time you make a variable has it live in the smallest possible scope and localize your variables as much as possible.</p><p id="78c0">Examples.</p><p id="6c59">Not pure function:</p><pre><span id="fffd">const name = 'Alice'<br>const sayHi = () =&gt; {<br>    console.log(`Hi ${name}`)<br>};<br>sayHi();</span></pre><p id="9400">Pure function:</p><pre><span id="345b">const sayHi = (name) =&gt; `Hi ${name}`;</span><span id="aa1c">sayHi(‘Alice’);</span></pre><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Photo by Ross Findon on Unsplash." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10624/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L" width="5312" height="2988" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rossf?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ross Findon</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="ec9c">Immutability is a concept that has its roots in Functional Programming. Whenever we want to introduce changes to some data, we should get a new object back with the updated data, instead of modifying the original one. You might think of immutability as “save as” because it returns a new object while traditional in-place mutation would be like “save” — updating original and letting go of the earlier state. It gives stricter control over your data, immediately making your code safer and more predictable.</p><p id="06b3">Primitives are only immutable values built into JavaScript. Consider the next example:</p><pre><span id="336b">let string = "An immutable string";<br>let otherString = string.slice(8, 17);</span></pre><p id="865a">Objects and arrays are mutable in JavaScript. It means that the data structure can be changed.</p><p id="9f80"><em>How to work with mutability in JavaScript?</em></p><p id="93f4">To begin with, most array methods are used, such as sort, push, pop, splice are destructive. There are indeed few non-destructive methods available — a slice. It returns a piece of a given array without modifying the original one.</p><pre><span id="4b56">let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];<br>let citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3);<br>console.log(citrus); // Outputs: Orange,Lemon<br>console.log(fruits); // Outputs: Banana, Orange, Lemon, Apple, Mango</span></pre><p id="d1f7">As you can see, the original array was preserved.</p><p id="bcd0">JS includes the spread operator. It provides an easy way to create a new array by copying over values from another array. The real power of spread operators comes from combining the spread syntax to make different operations like adding, removing, and updating.</p><pre><span id="e527">let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange"];<br>let updatedFruits = […fruits, 'Mango']; // Outputs: Banana, Orange, Mango</span></pre><p id="e2d6">In this example, I’m copying all the previous items, but I am also adding a new one all at once. The original array was not changed and I have an updated array. Besides slice, few other array methods also return a new object, instead of modifying the original one (filter, map, reduce, concat, etc.).</p><p id="56e9">To make objects immutable, we need to freeze them. The Object.freeze() method freezes an object. Thus objects become immutable. Using this method, nothing can be added to or removed from the properties set of a frozen object.

Referential Transparency means that functions do not rely on anything beyond their parameters, and consequence of this is that it becomes predictable in its behavior. It means that given the same parameters will return the same answer. It makes our code very testable.</p><p id="0015">If you are learning JavaScript, you might hear that in a language, functions are treated as first-class objects. This is because in JavaScript, as in other languages that support functional programming, functions are objects. A function of the first class can be an argument for another function, it can be assigned to a variable, in general, it can be handled just like any other object.</p><ul><li id="1bdb">Functions in JS can be assigned to variables:</li></ul><pre><span id="31cd">const sayHi = () =&gt; {<br>    return 'Hi ';<br>}<br>console.log(sayHi()); // Outputs: Hi</span></pre><ul><li id="3595">Functions in JS can be passed as arguments to a function:</li></ul><pre><span id="7fbf">const sayHiToSomeone = (callback, name) =&gt; {<br>    return callback() + ' ' + name;<br>}<br>console.log(sayHiToSomeone(sayHi, 'Max')); // Outputs: Hi Max</span></pre><ul><li id="315b">Functions in JS can be returned from a function:</li></ul><pre><span id="fd07">const greeterConstructor = greeting =&gt; {<br>    return country =&gt; {<br>        return greeting + ' ' + country;<br>    }<br>}<br>const engGreeter = greeterConstructor('Welcome to ');<br>console.log(engGreeter('England.')); // Outputs: Welcome to England.<br>const gerGreeter = greeterConstructor('Welkom Bij ');<br>console.log(gerGreeter('Duits.')) // Outputs: Welkom Bij Duits.</span></pre><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Photo by Shahadat Rahman on Unsplash." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@hishahadat?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shahadat Rahman</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a79f">Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions by either taking them as arguments or returning them.</p><p id="2907">A higher-order function is a major concept in Functional Programming. These functions allow you to write simpler and more elegant code. Using higher-order functions, we can reduce bugs and make our code easier to read and understand.</p><p id="eba4">The fact that JavaScript supports first-class functions makes it possible to create higher-order functions. So, the concept of first-class functions explained how functions are treated in JavaScript and how we use them. The reason we use both of these concepts is it helps to understand what is possible and thus take advantage of the power of the JavaScript language. The most common application of higher-order functions in JavaScript is the callback. There are several methods in JavaScript that allow us to pass a function that will be used as part of that method. ES5 array methods illustrate this well. For example, the sort function on arrays is a higher-order function. The sort function takes a function as an argument or, with an anonymous function. Map, reduce, filter, forEach are other examples of higher-order functions built into JavaScript. So, always try to use the built-in <em>higher-order functions</em> in Javascript that we can all leverage to make our code more elegant instead of control loops like For.</p><pre><span id="23ec">let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Papaya", "Mango"];<br>let sorted = fruits.sort();<br>console.log(sorted); // Outputs: Apple,Banana,Mango,Orange,Papaya</span><span id="696b">[1, 2, 3, 4].filter(function(n) {<br>    return n &gt; 2<br>}) // Outputs: 3, 4</span></pre><p id="124a">Functional Programming these days is becoming the standard of building maintainable and modern JavaScript applications. Concepts from this article will allow you to take advantage of Functional Programming and write cleaner code. Also, in this article, I didn’t include other Functional Programming concepts like recursion, monads, functors, lambda, monoid, curry, etc. They are quite advanced, so they were skipped in this article. Understanding these concepts of functional programming will definitely give you the upper hand.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

We have implemented several projects with video or audio calls enabled. That’s why I want to share my thoughts on when to build your own solution from scratch, when to use open source alternatives and when to order a custom solution from a third-party vendor.</p><p id="e70f">First, let me say a few words on the experience we gained with WebRTC in the recent few years.</p><ul><li id="1121">We came up with a SIP via WebRTC solution for a taxi management system that works in the Namba taxi project (Kyrgyzstan).</li><li id="5826">We built a PoC solution for a live chat widget that also included video and audio calls.</li><li id="ce1d">We built a PoC solution for a click-to-call button for websites.</li><li id="72d2">Integrated video calls for <a href="https://teacherly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teacherly</a> (UK).</li></ul><p id="f9b9">We needed to build a new dispatch system for Namba Taxi which was designed as a single-page web application. You could find more information about the differences between a mobile app and a single-page web application here:</p><p id="a935">We had several options for enabling calls to mobile phones in the browser, such as using a flash softphone and through WebRTC-based solutions. We decided on the second option because it was a brand new way to build audio and video communications, and flash was going to become an unsupported technology in a few years.</p><p id="a988">We solved a lot of problems on our way to a working solution. Finally, we found out that the combination of <a href="https://sipjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sip.js</a> and <a href="https://freeswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeSWITCH</a> is the most stable and feature-rich solution that covers all our needs.</p><p id="11dd">Here are the pros we found:</p><ul><li id="ddf8">It removed all our workarounds, like <a href="https://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asterisk</a>+<a href="https://www.doubango.org/webrtc2sip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webrtc2sip</a>+<a href="https://www.doubango.org/sipml5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sipml5</a> (these problems are described below).</li><li id="3121">This solution is neat and easy to understand for all project newbies.</li><li id="24f1">FreeSWITCH has more stable upgrades compared to Asterisk. They don’t break backward compatibility, and the overall quality of FreeSWITCH is better.</li><li id="f756">SIP.js is a well-designed and easy-to-use library that has better code and better compatibility with all browsers.</li></ul><p id="aa2d">And here are the cons of this solution:</p><ul><li id="b17e">Maintenance can be harder because everything has to be managed by your team. It’s hard to find a sysadmin with VOIP experience and an understanding of how it works.</li></ul><p id="9653">We also faced some issues with FreeSWITCH running in the production environment, see (1) &amp; (2) below.</p><ol><li id="30e0">Calls didn’t work on production on Firefox 38+, because their developers removed the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DTLS-SRTP</a> protocol and enabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFS</a> by default. PFS for FreeSWITCH was enabled in the next release though.</li><li id="f171">We had problems with Chrome 48+ because their developers changed their WebRTC API design. We solved this issue by moving from <a href="https://jssip.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jssip</a> to sip.js.</li></ol><p id="299f">Here are the solutions we tried to use, before deciding on a combination of FreeSWITCH and sip.js:</p><ol><li id="2a6a">Asterisk with WebRTC enabled + SIPML5.</li><li id="ab45">Asterisk with webrtc2sip + SIPML5.</li><li id="3f04">FreeSWITCH + jssip.</li></ol><p id="a485">The problems we faced before combining FreeSWITCH and sip.js:</p><ol><li id="78ba">The call hold feature didn’t work. We found a workaround by muting the dispatcher’s microphone.</li><li id="ae07">Crashes of the webrtc2sip media proxy. We had to go with a workaround here: during alpha testing, we implemented an automatic restart on failure because Asterisk had problems with WebRTC implementation.</li><li id="dbf6">Asterisk stability issues and a lot of crashes. We tried to run Asterisk without a media proxy and discovered that it’s hard to make it work. We had different crashes for two versions of Asterisk and found out that the Asterisk + webrtc2sip combination works fine for us.</li><li id="4886">Wrong configuration for STUN and TURN servers on both sides. The wrong configuration leads to one-way or no-audio issues.</li><li id="e7d3">We had a problem when we hung up the call from a mobile device. In that case, SIPML5 was calling. We fixed it by checking the status of a call on ‘I_new_call’ event and then tried moving to jssip and, finally, to sip.js.</li><li id="394a">WebRTC calls stopped working when we upgraded our Asterisk to 1.7 version. The problem here was caused by the incompatibility of invites. When Asterisk bridges call, it sends an invite using the AVP transport, while the webphone accepts only AVPF transport. Hence we get 603 SIP error with “failed to get local sdp” message. We decided to use webrtc2sip as a media proxy before Asterisk.</li><li id="014f">Memory leaks in webrtc2sip.</li></ol><p id="1638">At first sight, it’s easy to get a working prototype. To deploy it in our production environment, we will need to make sure that all of the following has been done:</p><ul><li id="e197">Ensure that video calls work with all types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAT</a>.</li><li id="d8e8">Ensure that all codecs work on different devices matching them with each other.</li><li id="71c4">Solve connectivity issues between all peers.</li><li id="848c">Deal with tradeoffs between latency and throughput for the best user experience.</li><li id="13c7">Solve issues to build a working and stable set of STUN and TURN servers that will work fast to gain speedier connectivity to the call.</li><li id="555e">Deal with tradeoffs between choosing the right audio sources because when we have two users talking right now we will have issues with the quality of sound.</li></ul><p id="b0e7">Try to avoid development from scratch. You can implement it only if it’s a key feature of your product. Solving all these problems can increase your time-to-market metric, and your release day may be postponed. Fortunately, you have other options to shorten the time to market.</p><h2 id="10c1">Open Source solutions</h2><p id="7078">During the COVID-19 crisis, we implemented video calls for the Teacherly project using <a href="https://jitsi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jitsi</a>. All the above-mentioned problems were solved by them, and we found it a very stable solution with great design, documentation, and SDKs.</p><p id="8e13">Jitsi’s pros and cons are listed below.</p><p id="3c54"><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li id="bddb">A complete working solution for audio and video calls with the support of group conferencing.</li><li id="6820">Easy to integrate.</li><li id="2dae">Integration can be done with your current team without extra resources.</li></ol><p id="fb53"><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ol><li id="6f26">You will have full control over the source code (as it is an open-source solution), but you will need time to clearly understand what’s in it in case you require additional customizations or new features.</li></ol><h2 id="9d6c">Third-party solutions</h2><p id="95fa">Another great option is to pay money to a WebRTC provider and integrate it with solutions like 3cx, Twilio, or Voximplant. They all have features that can be useful for your project.</p><p id="7fe3"><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li id="745a">They can be members of the webRTC consortium.</li><li id="d8c1">They have experience in solving almost all problems described above related to WebRTC calls.</li><li id="21a4">They have reasonable pricing.</li><li id="9c56">They have all the required SDKs for smooth integration.</li></ol><p id="f5aa"><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ol><li id="2586">There is no control of source code, but changes can be implemented by your current team.</li><li id="8167">Vendor lock-in (you depend on the service you have chosen).</li></ol><p id="4ec8">When time-to-market is critical, you should take a look at these third-party solutions.</p><ul><li id="e6e0"><a href="https://peerjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peer.js</a>. With peer.js, you can implement your own P2P calls across multiple devices, but you may need a <a href="https://peerjs.com/peerserver.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaling server</a>.</li><li id="7f35"><a href="https://jitsi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jitsi</a> is a ready-to-deploy video conferencing software with SDKs for mobile and web.</li><li id="99ad"><a href="https://www.3cx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3cx</a> is a feature-rich service for communications.</li><li id="b52e"><a href="https://voximplant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voximplant</a> is a video conferencing solution.</li><li id="0e99">Agora.io is a communications platform offering various options for video communications.</li><li id="58be">Livewebinar.com offers software for conducting webinars.</li><li id="639f"><a href="https://freeswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freeswitch</a> is a Software-defined Telecom Stack of tools and technologies.</li><li id="4eb6"><a href="https://sipjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sipjs</a> is the JS library enabling one to successfully combine WebRTC and SIP signaling.</li></ul><p id="4dd6">All these products can help you build your own solution for audio or video calls in your project.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OzJUNsPx60" width="320" youtube-src-id="4OzJUNsPx60"></iframe></p><p>I recently came across a YouTube video about an exciting new development. Researchers at NVIDIA enabled an AI to essentially recreate PAC-MAN after watching some 50,000 episodes of the game being played. The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/22/gamegan-research-pacman-anniversary/" target="_blank">blog post</a> makes for fascinating reading and it made me think more about the potential machine learning could have for mobile game development.</p><p>Machine learning is a fast growing industry that was worth $6.9bn globally in 2018 alone, according to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/machine-learning-market" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Grand View Research</a>. Furthermore, recent research by <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/machine-learning-market-2494" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Market Research Future</a> indicates it is expected to grow by around "42.08% CAGR during the forecast period 2018–2024". A lot of reporting done by media outlets such as <i>Forbes</i> have highlighted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/01/19/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2020/#7e93fbb85c02" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">potential growth</a> in areas such as driver safety, internet security, applications in the financial market et al.&nbsp;</p><p>What about mobile gaming, though? Machine learning is already being used by companies in this space to improve <a href="https://addepto.com/monetize-mobile-gaming-machine-learning/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monetisation</a>&nbsp;(helping to create personalised in-game offers, for example),&nbsp;but I think there are some exciting applications for machine learning still to come:</p><div><ul><li>Rapid prototyping: train an AI to watch gameplay of say, hypercasual games, and feed in art and music to create prototypes of new games quickly and efficiently. You could easily create multiple variations if needed.</li><li>Crowd-sourced games: Imagine a social media site where game ideas are submitted. The most popular ideas are turned into games there and then.</li><li>Personalised 'Netflix for mobile games': Don't like the guns in your mobile FPS? Imagine a service where game assets are personalised on the fly. You could have games to play wherever you want them, how you want them.&nbsp;</li><li>New gift idea: this idea of intimate personalisation opens up the market for personalised mobile games as gifts. You could give someone a platformer, for example, just the way they like it, with their own ideas incorporated in it.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>With the emergence of this technology, it could also challenge existing business models and relationships between developers and publishers may change. How will it work if prototypes can be quickly made without too much human intervention? Will developers be paid per successful idea? Will everything be dependent on great art or music?&nbsp;</p><p>There are exciting and challenging times ahead and the games that emerge from this period will reflect that.&nbsp;</p></div>

As I wrote <a href="https://staticcatgames.blogspot.com/2020/07/do-mobile-game-revenue-models-need-a-rethink.html" target="_blank">recently</a>, Apple is altering contracts for some of its Apple Arcade developers as it focuses more and more on the need for engagement instead of throwing large numbers of games at subscribers and hoping something will stick. Apple execs have come to the conclusion that throwing money at games and building a large library of games just won't cut it. Bankrolling games for little to no return isn't a viable business model in the long term. <i>MacRumors </i>gives an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/30/apple-arcade-game-strategy-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">example of the costs</a>, saying: "Apple has funded work on many games that have been created for ‌Apple Arcade‌, spending between $1 million and $5 million on several titles so far." <br> What they need are players to carry on, well, <i>playing </i>these games day in, day out.&nbsp; <br> The major problem Apple is facing is that none of the games in the Apple Arcade portfolio are major hits. It needs to rectify this and fast. Competition for the subscription service comes from its own app store, which offers a vast number of games (…

Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it.

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>
